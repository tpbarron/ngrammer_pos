<s>im a college student with multiple student loans of different sizes and varying interest rates</s>
<s>my loans arent in repayment yet</s>
<s>which is usually the better idea keep the loans separated or consolidate them into one giant loan with one rate</s>

<p>
<s>consolidating your government loans will vastly simplify your repayment schedule and may lower your monthly payments but its unlikely to save you money</s>
<s>in fact it could be a costly move</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with a government direct consolidation loan you can take up to 30 years to repay your educational debts</s>
<s>but if youre stretching your payments over a longer period of time youll ultimately write more checks and pay more in interest</s>
<s>if you consolidate you may also lose benefits offered under your original loan such as cancellation options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one advantage of having separate loans is that you can concentrate your financial resources on paying off the highest interest debt first</s>
<s>if you consolidate the debt will all stand at the same rate</s>
<s>for government loans that will be the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being combined rounded up to the nearest 18th of 1 and not to exceed 825</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to consolidate private student loans youd essentially be refinancing taking out a new loan at a new interest rate based on your fico credit score</s>
<s>usually a students fico score decreases with each year in school since their debt increases says mark kantrowitz publisher of finaidorg</s>
<s>private consolidation generally does not save money until the students credit score has improved usually several years after graduation if the borrower has been paying all his or her obligations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also consider the fact that upon receiving a consolidated loan you will need to begin repaying it within 60 days</s>
<s>so you may lose deferment options available on some of your original student loans</s>
