<p>
<s>a yes  but itll be iffy the year after you receive the windfall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youll have to list the money as income on the fafsa aid form even though its not counted as income on your taxes</s>
<s>and since the aid formulas weigh income far more heavily than assets youll probably be on the hook for full tuition that year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your best bet for snagging some bucks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after you send your form to the schools submit a request for a professional judgment review</s>
<s> include a brief letter to the financial aid administrator stating the inheritance is a onetime event that doesnt reflect your expected future earnings and enclose a copy of the relevant estate paperwork says mark kantrowitz publisher of fastwebcom and finaidorg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the good news is that the following year the money is considered part of your assets which gives you a better shot at aid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>have a question about your money</s>
<s>email the help desk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can limit the impact a little more by fully funding a retirement account like a roth ira the fafsa formula doesnt count retirement savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or use the money to cancel debt having a large credit card balance doesnt buy you a better aid package</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>using assets to pay it off improves both your finances and chances at aidÂ </s>
