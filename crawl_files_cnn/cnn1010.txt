<p>
<s>pay as you earn is a new government program designed to keep debt manageable for lowincome graduates by limiting federal loan payments to 10 of their discretionary income</s>
<s>unpaid balances are forgiven after 20 years</s>
<s>the hitch the program doesnt cover loans made before 2012</s>
<s>so your son doesnt qualify</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead he can apply for the older incomebased repayment program which sets higher payment caps and erases any balances after 25 years or 10 years of public service work</s>
<s>see the ibr calculator at studentaidedgov</s>
<s> if his earnings rise he can switch to a 10year payment plan that will cut his interest costs</s>
