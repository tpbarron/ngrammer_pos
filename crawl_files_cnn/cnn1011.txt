<s>my wife has over $300000 in medical school loans</s>
<s>we are currently paying them back through the income based repayment program because she is still in her residency</s>
<s>there are five loans in all with interest rates between 35 and 8</s>

<p>
<s>the first thing you need to do is to determine what type of loans you have federal private or a combination of both</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>federal loans can be consolidated through the direct federal loan program at loanconsolidationedgov</s>
<s>when you consolidate through this program youll get a weighted average of all of the interest rates on your loans which should keep the cost around the same says mark kantrowitz publisher of finaidorg</s>
<s>while you wont necessarily save on interest you will be better able to track your payments and make sure no payments fall through the cracks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>loans you may have borrowed from a private lender are more of a challenge</s>
<s>as the market for private student loans has shrunk dramatically over the past several years so has the number of lenders willing to do student loan consolidations</s>
<s>recently however some lenders have entered or reentered the market</s>
<s>for a complete list go to finaidorgprivateconsolidation</s>
<s> most however offer only variable rates which may easily increase over the years</s>
<s>youll want to consider carefully whether its worth consolidating especially if your current private loans are at a fixed rate says kantrowitz</s>

<p>
<s>you may be able to lower the rate on some of your private loans by simply calling your lenders and asking for a better rate advises kalman chaney author of paying for college without going broke and founder of financialaid adviser campus consultants</s>
<s>this tactic may be more effective after your wife has been in her medical career a few years and her income increases</s>
<s>another possibility to look into extending the repayment period on her lowestrate student loans</s>
<s>on many federal and some private student loans the term can be extended up to 30 years</s>
<s>by choosing to extend repayment even slightly on the lowest interest loans you can free up more cash temporarily to pay off the higher interest loans more quickly advises chaney</s>
<s>and definitely check to see if your loans offer discounts for automatic payments from your bank account</s>
<s>you could save a quarter or even a half a percent if you do this says kantrowitz</s>
<s>and youll be certain not to miss a payment</s>
