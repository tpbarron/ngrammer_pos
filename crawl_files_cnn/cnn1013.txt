<s>new york cnnmoney  only two monthly jobs reports remain before the presidential election but dont expect either of them to swing undecided voters</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>economists surveyed by cnnmoney predict the september jobs report released friday will indicate that employers added 110000 jobs during the month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a slight improvement over 96000 jobs created in august but over the longer term its not worth celebrating</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the past two years the economy added an average of 140000 jobs each month</s>
<s>hiring at that level is barely enough to keep pace with population growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unless jobs suddenly spike above 200000 or hiring comes to a near standstill voters arent going to bat an eyelid said dan hamilton director of economics at california lutheran universitys forecast center</s>
</p>

<p>

<s>the looming fiscal issues appear to be weighing on business expansion plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>zandi is slightly more optimistic than other economists surveyed by cnnmoney predicting employers added 130000 jobs in september</s>
<s>even so thats unlikely to impact the election he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the report is close to my expectations then it should not have a meaningful impact on the election he said</s>
</p>
