<s>i have a grad school loan of around $43000</s>
<s>the interest rate is 475 and i can only afford to pay $300 a month which barely covers the interest</s>
<s>it is a degree in the arts and i have never been able to pay more than the $300 a month</s>
<s>i let the interest roll over the first few years foolishly but started making regular payments in 2005 and i have only paid the loan down a thousand bucks from the original amount that i graduated with back in 1999</s>
<s>i am 41 years old have no savings and i work in the arts and fear that i will be paying off this loan into my 60s or 70s</s>
<s>what can i do to get this monkey off my back faster beyond the obvious  paying more each month</s>

<s>we understand your frustration</s>
<s>nobody wants to be grappling with student loan debt while bouncing a grandchild on his knee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said your options depend in part on whether your student loan is private or federal says lauren asher president of the project on student debt</s>
<s>if its private you are at the mercy of your lender so reach out to them to see whats available</s>
<s>if its federal—which it sounds like it is—some debt repayment plans may offer relief but they wont necessarily get the debt paid off faster</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you havent already done so one option to consider is the relatively new incomebased repayment program offered through the department of education for federal loans</s>
<s>here payments are based on your income and after 25 years your outstanding debt is forgiven although you may owe taxes on the forgiven debt</s>
<s>click here to get an estimate of what your payments might be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another possibility would be to take a job in public service say as an art teacher for a public school system</s>
<s>after 10 years of fulltime work your remaining student loan debt would be forgiven</s>
<s>check with the direct loan program to see what other options may be available</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the truth is there likely is no magic bullet youre probably going to have to find a way to earn more or spend less</s>
<s>so while it may be a tough pill to swallow consider taking on projects that are more commercial or even a second job</s>
<s>if you live alone add a roommate</s>
<s>not only will improving your finances help with your student loan debt it can also help you accumulate some savings—something thats just as important as paying down what you owe</s>
