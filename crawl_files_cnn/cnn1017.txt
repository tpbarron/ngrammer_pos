</p>

<p>
<s>my upbringing was typical of american children born in the 1930s</s>
<s>i was the youngest of three siblings and the only boy in my family</s>
<s>our mother was a homemaker and our father worked as a salesman for the old studebaker company and served as an officer in the army in both world war i and world war ii</s>
<s>he said cars were so slow to sell back then that hed take a car off the freight train and drive it around from dealer to dealer until he sold it</s>
<s>then hed go back to the train to get the next one</s>
<s>we lived in philadelphia until i was in the 11th grade then i finished high school in st petersburg fla</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i played all kinds of sports and got a scholarship to play football at the university of tennessee where i was captain of the 1952 team</s>
<s>the things that help one succeed in football will also help one to succeed in business</s>
<s>in football youve got a coach who has to get the best players put them in the right position make them practice hard and execute a game plan</s>
<s>if the players do all those things you win</s>
<s>business is the same thing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after i received my bs</s>
<s>in finance from the university of tennessee i went into the army</s>
<s>i served in korea for 13 months after the war ended and was a company commander in a combat engineering company</s>
<s>when i got out in 1955 i was offered three jobs  being a high school football coach selling advertising for a tv station and being a wholesale salesman for fleet oil</s>
<s>the coaching job wouldnt start paying until summer and i wasnt sure tv was going to make it</s>
<s>so i went to work for fleet oil which was getting into the wholesale business in lafollette tenn after i had spent six months in sales the owner sam claiborne said come learn about the operations side of the gas station business</s>
<s> he started the chain of sail oil gas stations and let me run it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i wanted to be in business for myself and after two years i decided to start pilot</s>
<s>we wanted to call the company jet but that trademark was taken</s>
<s>we decided to name the company pilot because the word conveys being in charge</s>
<s>sam had taught me all i knew so i agreed not to build any locations near his gas stations for three years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more how we got started the blue man group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1958 there were a lot of independent cutrate stations on the border between tennessee and virginia</s>
<s>because of the tax situation gas and cigarettes were cheaper in virginia</s>
<s>a station became available in gate city va and we bought it for $6000</s>
<s>it did well from the start so we were lucky</s>
<s>by 1965 we had 12 locations in virginia tennessee and kentucky</s>
<s>we always chose places where there was a market with good volume which back then was usually small towns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our team would travel to a town and get up early to look at traffic patterns</s>
<s>we wanted to be on the righthand side of the road on the far corner past the traffic light so drivers could get in and out easier</s>
<s>at the time there were the big company gas stations  exxon xom fortune 500 mobil shell rdsa texaco  and then there were the independents like us</s>
<s>there were gas stations on every corner and it was dog eat dog</s>
<s>in the 1960s to stand out in customer service wed find out customers names then put a piece of tape with their name on it inside the gas cap so that when they left the attendant could say thank you mrs</s>
<s>smith</s>
<s> today we get their name from the credit card</s>
<s>but thats how you say thank you to people</s>
<s>you use their name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gas was 279Â¢ a gallon when we started in 1958</s>
<s>in the 60s and 70s there were a lot of price wears and wed lose money at times selling gas at cost</s>
<s>it was difficult starting from scratch</s>
<s>we borrowed from a number of banks to start each location</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we didnt have a lot of capital and marathon oil mro fortune 500 saw that we were expanding</s>
<s>marathon was looking for people who would buy their products and it offered to buy half our business for $200000 in 1965</s>
<s>it also loaned us $4 million to build new gas stations</s>
<s>the stations were little 200squarefoot buildings with restrooms on the side and six gas pumps</s>
<s>all we sold were drinks lance cookies cigarettes and motor oil</s>
<s>we repaid the loan in the mid1970s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1974 my first wife cynthia died</s>
<s>our oldest son jimmy was 20 when he took her seat on the pilot board in 1975</s>
<s>he was a senior at the university of tennessee and started working fulltime for the company in 1976</s>
<s>in the early 1970s we figured out wed have to sell more stuff to pay for the properties</s>
<s>so we built convenience stores</s>
<s>we added food and the things one can buy in convenience stores today</s>
<s>the challenge one always has is how will we get sales</s>
<s>one has to have a clean place that looks good gives customers good value and has good people working there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more how we got started the lucky jeans guys</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today we have a sophisticated pilot flying j university for training</s>
<s>but back then wed have district managers who would train people one by one on everything from customer service to watching the numbers</s>
<s>we would try to get 50 of our profit from petroleum and 50 from nonpetroleum products</s>
<s>even today we want our people to be conscious of how much profits and margins should be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of the secrets to success is adding new products and creating new ways to do business</s>
<s>we have to keep changing because our customers are always changing</s>
<s>in 1980 a friend of ours told us about ken pritchard a former football player at the university of tennessee who had built a new concept in slidell la that was a convenience store with gas pumps in front and diesel fuel behind it</s>
<s>we decided to do the same thing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so in 1981 we built our first travel center</s>
<s>president reagan had just deregulated trucking so there was a proliferation of small trucking companies that became good customers</s>
<s>we filled a real niche</s>
<s>in 1988 we bought out marathon oil got the company back to ourselves and kept building travel centers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im really proud of what pilot has become</s>
<s>our reputation is built on cleanliness and customer service</s>
<s>it varies by store but maintenance is supposed to check every 30 minutes to make sure the restrooms are clean</s>
<s>in the past other managers and i would go into the stores and get a feel for what was going on</s>
<s>friends would tell us if they ran into a dirty restroom somewhere</s>
<s>now we do spot checks through mystery shoppers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2001 we again partnered with marathon marathon ashland petroleums speedway superamerica and merged our travel centers</s>
<s>together we had 232 travel centers and then we bought out williams travel centers for $189 million in 2003 and added 40 more locations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more how we got started zappos silent founder</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>marathon has always been a good partner</s>
<s>it provided us with the products to sell and the financing</s>
<s>weve always been the operating partner and it let us operate independently</s>
<s>in 2008 marathon was disposing of some of its marketing assets and told us it wanted to sell</s>
<s>so we got together with cvc capital partners and bought marathon out for $700 million</s>
<s>the family retains 60 of the company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2010 we felt it was logical to merge with flying j because our locations meshed</s>
<s>today pilot flying j has 496 travel centers in the us and canada</s>
<s>we also kept 40 convenience stores in knoxville</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pilot has been a family business that suits our energy and interests</s>
<s>when i turned 65 in 1995 my older son jimmy became ceo and i became the chairman</s>
<s>my son bill was president from 1995 to 1999 and is now the governor of tennessee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now as founder and chairman emeritus i visit stores as much as i can to greet people and tell them how important they are to us</s>
<s>the most important customer is the one walking in the door right now</s>
<s>i want to make sure we keep this culture going</s>
<s>everything starts at the top in a business</s>
<s>as a leader one has to set the example</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do the right thing</s>
<s>if an employee needs medical treatment for a family member give him time off</s>
<s>if a customer is dissatisfied with a product take it back and make him happy</s>
<s>be a good corporate citizen</s>
<s>people will remember what you do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hold people accountable</s>
<s>we have monthly goals</s>
<s>if our people dont make them they have to explain why</s>
<s>when they make their goals we reward them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>keep an eye on the competition</s>
<s>well have a mystery shopper visit one of our stores and hell mysteryshop one of our competitors</s>
<s>if the competition wins we look at why it was better than us and we make sure it never happens again</s>
