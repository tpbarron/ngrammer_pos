<s>new york cnnmoney  small business played a major role during the republican convention this week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nearly every speaker at the convention in tampa fla had something to say about companies and how much theyve suffered during the past four years particularly small ones</s>
<s>all focused their aim at president obama</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but were their points true</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on regulation john thune a us</s>
<s>senator from south dakota criticized the president for using big government to meddle with the rural way of life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of preserving family farms and ranches president obamas policies are effectively regulating them out of business</s>
<s>his administration even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its true the labor department did make that proposal last year</s>
<s>federal officials sought to outlaw having kids younger than 16 engage in activity deemed dangerous such as driving tractors or handling pesticides</s>
<s>that riled up farmers to whom having a young teen maneuver a tractor is an everyday chore</s>
<s>taking part in farm work is also seen as a way to pass along the craft to the next generation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related eastwoods inflated unemployment count</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are dangers to that though and labor officials were looking at statistics that some may find surprising</s>
<s>more kids get hurt working agricultural jobs than any other</s>
<s>those jobs claimed the lives of 200 kids between 1992 and 1998 according to the most recent report from the labor department</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>labor officials backed away from the proposal in april citing a respect for the rural way of life and instead promising to rely on educational programs to reduce the number of accidents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for thunes other criticism its a stretch to say the presidents policies are destroying family farms</s>
<s>census data shows that as of 2010 the number of farms is actually up slightly to 22 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also the obama administration has instituted specific programs to help farmers through the agriculture department in a know your farmer know your food campaign</s>
<s>the program tries to connect consumers with producers offering an online map to find things like local farmers markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on even more regulation sher valenzuela whos running for lieutenant governor of delaware had this to say about government pressures on businesses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre on track to create 109 million new paperwork burden hours and by years end $110 billion worth of new regulatory costs will be laid on the back of business owners and taxpayers she said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>her speech prepared by convention staff relied on statistics compiled by the republicanled american action forum</s>
<s>the groups director of regulatory policy sam batkins said they keep track of all new paperwork by relying on government announcements</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its worth putting these 109 million hours into perspective</s>
<s>in 2010 americans spent 88 billion hours filing federal paperwork for their businesses or in their personal lives according to the office of information and regulatory affairs</s>
<s>thats about 37 hours a year for each adult</s>
<s>adding 109 million hours through new regulations would tack on only another 1 to the total</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more importantly though the total number of hours has actually gone down sharply during the obama administration</s>
<s>it rose from about 7 billion to nearly 10 billion during the bush years</s>
<s>obama ordered that agencies get rid of absurd and unnecessary paperwork requirements that waste time and money and get more businessfriendly</s>

<p>
<s>so president obama with all due respect dont tell me that my parents didnt build their business south carolina gov</s>
<s>nikki haley to much applause</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>actually the president didnt say that at all</s>
<s>its a criticism based on a false premise thats been debunked various times by many including cnn</s>
<s>to clarify heres what the president stated during a july 13 speech</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you were successful somebody along the line gave you some help</s>
<s>there was a great teacher somewhere in your life</s>
<s>somebody helped to create this unbelievable american system that we have that allowed you to thrive</s>
<s>somebody invested in roads and bridges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youve got a business  you didnt build that he continued</s>
<s>somebody else made that happen</s>
<s>the internet didnt get invented on its own</s>
<s>government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet</s>
<s>the point is is that when we succeed we succeed because of our individual initiative but also because we do things together</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when put into context its clear obama was referring to infrastructure and societys role in every persons successes</s>
