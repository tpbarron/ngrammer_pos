<s>to the investors on intrade there was little question who came away from wednesday nights presidential debate on top mitt romney</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>intrade is a prediction market that allows investors to wager on the outcome of events</s>
<s>in this case the presidential election</s>
<s>watch video the debate in 99 seconds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>earlier this week the sites users placed the odds that president obama would win reelection as high as 79</s>
<s>just before the debate began the odds were at 74</s>
<s>but in the minutes after the debate finished the index showed obamas numbers had fallen to 689</s>
<s>an hour later the odds had dropped further to 67</s>
<s>and by 10 am thursday they were down to 661</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>intrades odds of obamas reelection fell nearly 8 percentage points since the open of trading thursday</s>
<s>thats the biggest daily drop for the obama during this election cycle</s>
<s>the next biggest decline came on aug 20 2011 but that was only a 27point decline</s>
<s>that drop came two weeks after standard  poors had downgraded the us credit rating prompting a sharp slide in us stock prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the numbers may well change as more trades come in but the figures suggest romney improved his chances of capturing the white house</s>
<s>of course there is a long way to go and at least two more presidential debates before election day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>intrade works by letting users swap contracts on events with a yes or no outcome</s>
<s>president obama will win reelection or he wont</s>
<s>a correct prediction moves the value of a contract to $10</s>
<s>a miss leaves you with $0</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but intrade isnt just about betting</s>
<s>its users are  taken together  shockingly good at correctly forecasting election results intrade bettors correctly picked the winner of every single state during the 2004 presidential election</s>
<s>in 2008 they missed two  wrongly calling indiana for john mccain and missouri for barack obama</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and that is way way more accurate than most single polls  to say nothing of the predictions offered by the professional pundit class</s>
