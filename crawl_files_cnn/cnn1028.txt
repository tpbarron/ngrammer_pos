<s>as an entrepreneur protecting your inventions against the competition is one of the most important things you need to do</s>
<s>if you dont you put your hard work and good ideas at risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>patents are both offensive and defensive weapons in the increasingly cutthroat modern business environment</s>
<s>so take a few minutes to educate yourself</s>
<s>you wont regret it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last years america invents act brought the most important changes to patent law since thomas jefferson wrote patents into the constitution in 1787</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres what you need to know</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>firstto file the new law takes us from a firsttoinvent to a firsttofile system</s>
<s>in other words patents are awarded to the entity that files first the starting block is the date of application not the date of invention</s>
<s>so if youve invented something file as quickly as possible</s>
<s>its also a good idea to consult with a lawyer and formulate a game plan from the beginning</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a good plan can start with whats known as a provisional patent</s>
<s>they are quicker easier and cheaper than the alternative  a nonprovisional or full patent</s>
<s>and if you file for a complete patent within one year of your provisional you can use the provisional filing date to get ahead of the competition</s>
<s>related story what kodaks patents produced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fees when you need to file fast cost neednt slow you down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are fees for both provisional and full patents</s>
<s>small entities enjoy discounted fees however</s>
<s>also if you are a small entity an additional fee for paper filing is cut in half</s>
<s>but this additional fee does not apply if businesses regardless of size file their patent application online</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>depending on the size of your business the fee for a provisional patent might be as low as $125 and $530 for a full patent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fast track if you really want to be speedy theres a new fasttrack option open to small entities for $4800</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even better if you qualify as a microentity you might be eligible for a 50 discount</s>
<s>a microentity is a small entity where the applicant is not the named inventor on more than four other patent applications and neither the applicants annual income nor the income of the entity is three times larger than the us median income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>where to go the new law requires the us patent and trademark office to establish at least three satellite locations by september 2014</s>
<s>thats a good development because geographic diversity can make the patent system easier for small businesses to navigate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example potential offices in denver and silicon valley are better placed to help the inventors near them than a single faraway office in washington dc and examiners who live in the community will be more connected to local entrepreneurs and their issues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>review process so thats how to navigate the new first to file system</s>
<s>but what happens if you dont file first</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to be sure in such cases the road to protecting your invention will be longer and rockier</s>
<s>but all hope isnt lost</s>
<s>the new law includes two review processes to challenge patents you believe infringe on your idea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first is called a postgrant review</s>
<s>that gives you nine months to petition the patent office if you think an existing patent includes something that you invented first</s>
<s>but theres a catch  the review costs $35800</s>
<s>so think carefully and file quickly to avoid this situation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other way to challenge the validity of current patents if you were beaten to the punch is to ask the patent office for an inter partes review</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for this review you have nine months from the time the patent is issued or after the end of a postgrant review</s>
<s>to avoid lengthy and costly battles a ruling must be made within one year from when the patent was granted</s>
<s>the review costs $27200</s>
