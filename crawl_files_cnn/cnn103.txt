<s>new york cnnmoney  mitt romney has been saying that under his tax plan highincome households would continue to pay the same share of taxes as they pay today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>during tuesday nights town hall debate with president obama he got more specific</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the top 5 of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 of the income tax the nation collects</s>
<s>so thatll stay the same romney said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>who is in the top 5</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this year the top 5 of households have at least $181000 in adjusted gross income according to estimates from the tax policy center</s>
<s>by 2014 that number is projected to rise to $200000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a group the top 5 will pay about 57 of all federal income taxes this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>note that romneys promise to freeze the share of taxes paid by the rich is not necessarily the same as saying the tax bills of some highincome filers wouldnt go down</s>
<s>as with any tax reform proposal some members of an income group would pay more and some would pay less</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related middle class promises hard to keep</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under romneys plan the top 5 of households  and every other household  would have their income tax rates cut by 20</s>
<s>his plan would also repeal the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax</s>
<s>finally it would make investment income tax free for those earning less than $100000 $200000 if married</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney on tuesday night also reiterated that he would pay for all of his tax cuts estimated to cost $5 trillion over a decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits particularly for people at the high end because i am not going to have people at the high end pay less than theyre paying now he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one way he might do so is to cap how much a tax filer can claim in various tax breaks he has said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>earlier this month when romney mentioned the idea of a cap he was talking about itemized deductions</s>
<s>his campaign told cnnmoney that such a cap would be adopted in conjunction with curbs on other tax breaks  namely personal exemptions and the taxfree benefit workers receive when their employers help pay for their health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at tuesdays debate his comments suggested the cap might apply to a broader swath of breaks including tax credits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ill pick a number  $25000 of deductions and credits and you can decide which ones to use romney said</s>
<s>your home mortgage interest deduction charity child tax credit and so forth you can use those as part of filling that bucket  of deductions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed hes been offering a lot of options that could pay for his tax cuts</s>
<s>the governor has described other approaches as well and he will work with congress to negotiate tax reform to ensure his goals are met a romney campaign spokesperson said after the debate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a cap of $25000 might significantly curtail the tax savings enjoyed by many in the top 5</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most households in that income group took an average of $43208 in itemized deductions alone last year while those in the top 1 took an average of $173670 according to tax policy center estimates</s>
