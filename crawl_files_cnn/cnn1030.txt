<s>new york cnnmoney  credit card issuers are ramping up lending to consumers with poor credit</s>
<s>but borrowers beware the terms arent always going to be good</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lending to subprime consumers  typically those with a fico credit score of below 660  climbed 41 last year with banks issuing 11 million new credit cards to riskier consumers a fouryear high according to a recent report from credit reporting agency equifax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>credit limits on new subprime credit cards also grew climbing 55 from 2010 to 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just a year ago it was much more difficult for someone with average or low credit to get credit cards said beverly harzog a credit card analyst at creditcom</s>
<s>but now the economy has been getting a little better issuers are feeling more comfortable and in order to increase revenue banks are realizing they need to expand their customer base</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but just because a bank is willing to extend credit to a subprime borrower doesnt mean its going to offer them favorable terms and conditions</s>
<s>its still going to be tough to find a card with a low interest rate and decent fees said harzog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consumers with credit scores in the 620 to 659 range are generally considered to have fair credit according to credit card comparison website cardhubcom</s>
<s>and while there are some decent deals out there for these customers aprs are still going to be high</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the average apr on credit cards for these borrowers is about 20 according to cardhubcom</s>
<s>that compares to an average apr of 17 for customers with good credit 660719 and a 13 apr for those with excellent credit 720850</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the goal is to rebuild your credit however the apr shouldnt be as big of an issue since you should be paying your bill in full each month</s>
<s>in this case fees can often play a bigger factor than the apr said cardhub ceo odysseas papadimitriou</s>
<s>cards with fees totaling less than $40 per year are worth considering he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those with poor credit who typically have scores below 620 will likely be offered cards with super high interest rates and fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>credit card issuer first premier for example has a credit card aimed at customers with poor credit that charges more than $200 in fees per year and comes with a 36 apr</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so its important to read the fine print on any offers very carefully harzog said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you have to watch out for predatory subprime lenders who might charge processing fees fairly high annual fees and interest rates that can exceed 36 she said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steer clear of those skyhigh interest rates she said</s>
<s>if you have an emergency expense that prevents you from paying off the balance right away credit card debt can spiral out of control in a flash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for consumers with bad credit a secured card is likely a better option said harzog</s>
<s>secured cards require a deposit so the cardholder is in essence borrowing against their own money</s>
<s>as a result these cards provide lower interest rates than unsecured credit cards</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beyond that secured cards work much like regular credit cards and report payments to the major credit bureaus to help you build a credit history</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>harzog recommends orchard banks secured card for those looking to build their credit</s>
<s>orchard bank part of hsbc offers three credit cards plus a secured card for consumers and the bank decides which card you qualify for based on your credit worthiness</s>
<s>if you just want to apply for the secured card there is a separate application you can fill out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with the secured card you must make a $200 minimum security deposit</s>
<s>the apr is a low 799 and the $35 annual fee is waived the first year</s>
<s>after you have used the secured card responsibly for at least 12 months the bank will consider graduating you to one of its unsecured cards</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while there are some hopeless credit cases who should probably never own a credit card again many subprime borrowers who were cut off from credit over the past few years deserve a second chance said harzog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many people were thrown into the subprime category because something bad happened to them during the recession  like they lost a job  and if that bad thing hadnt happened they would have kept paying their bills on time said harzog</s>
<s>now these people want a chance to get back on track</s>
