<s>june shin is a divorc�e with children who lost half her retirement savings and sold her home</s>
<s>now shes learning how to get her income back on track</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  last year was an eventful one for june shin</s>
<s>she divorced her husband of 11 years and in the settlement gave up about half of her 401k and company stock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>she and her ex also sold the fivebedroom home where theyd lived for nine years and used half the $150000 proceeds to pay off debt</s>
<s>june subsequently rented a townhouse for herself and their three sons ages 6 9 and 11 of whom she has partial custody</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im basically starting over again personally and financially says shin 40 a business manager at a large company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>she isnt totally back to square one</s>
<s>shin still has $102000 in her 401k plus shes stashing 10 of her $97000 salary in her plan and $400 a month in the bank</s>
<s>but now that shes down to one income she wonders whether she can save enough to get back on track for retirement</s>
<s>shes also not sure if she should buy a home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>financial planners heidi davis of bellevue wash and peggy cabaniss of lafayette calif offer answers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>three fixes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the best thing any newly divorced parent can do is get stabilized says cabaniss</s>
<s>she recommends that shin do a thorough analysis of cash flow using a program like quicken to see where her $5000 monthly takehome pay goes and to identify ways to save more of it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shin had planned to stop working at 60</s>
<s>but with her 401k halved shed need to put away $30000 a year to get there</s>
<s>a more realistic option cabaniss says would be to boost her contribution to at least 13 and retire at 65</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shin should also be better diversified</s>
<s>her portfolio is now 100 in stocks</s>
<s>cabaniss suggests shin put 35 of her 401k in a bond fund and 65 into stock funds</s>
<s>she should also cash out of company stock systematically using the proceeds to fund her ira and college savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a 20 down payment on a fourbedroom in the area runs upwards of $100000</s>
<s>shin has $24000 in cash savings  but that should be set aside for emergencies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a single mom providing for four she should aim to have a cushion of up to nine months expenses about $45000</s>
<s>after hitting that then she can start on a down payment if she wants to buy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>besides says davis there are so many changes and stressors surrounding a divorce it may make sense to stay put awhile</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>total assets $171000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>total liabilities $31800</s>
</p>
