<s>behind the scenes nick swinmurn quietly built a retail giant named zappos</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fortune  many people probably think it was zappos ceo tony hsieh who founded one of the largest footwear retailers in the united states</s>
<s>it wasnt</s>
<s>the guy who came up with the idea and persuaded hsieh to invest is nick swinmurn a quiet entrepreneur</s>
<s>his willingness to put success before ego was amply rewarded when amazon acquired zappos for $12 billion</s>
<s>his story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i was born in england and we moved to the united states when i was 7</s>
<s>my father was an engineer for the same company for 30 years and my mom was a teacher</s>
<s>we laugh because we werent sure where my interest in business came from</s>
<s>but my parents encouraged me to do entrepreneurial things</s>
<s>when i was in college they were willing to cosign a lease so i could open a salad bar but the building owner expected me to take over $35000 in equipment debt that he had so i said no to the deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i majored in film studies at uc</s>
<s>santa barbara and graduated in 1995 but didnt know what i wanted to do</s>
<s>so i took a job with the san bernardino stampede a minorleague baseball team for $12000 a year working in ticket sales then moved to the san diego padres</s>
<s>after a year i decided there was nowhere for me to advance to so i moved back to the bay area</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i tried to start a recreational sports league then i answered an ad for autoweb a carbuying service online where the founder and ceo were only a year older than me</s>
<s>in 1997 everyone was so excited about the internet</s>
<s>i volunteered to help with all the stuff people didnt want to do with the goal of learning how to start something myself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after 11 months i left and started 4studentscom a student portal where you could email other students and get deals on shopping</s>
<s>studentadvantagecom wanted to hire me and rebrand the site under theirs but i decided the student thing wasnt for me so i just shut it down</s>

<s>more tony hsieh  the best advice i ever got</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one day i was at the mall and couldnt find a pair of the airwalk desert boots i wanted</s>
<s>so i thought why not do an online shoe store</s>
<s>i went to footwear etc</s>
<s>in sunnyvale calif and said ill take some pictures put your shoes online and if people buy them ill buy them from you at full price</s>
<s> the store said okay and i got a few orders</s>
<s>then i went to a shoe show and thought i need to put this giant collection online</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i took a job as a contractor for silicon graphics to make money to live on and started raising funds for the company which i called shoesitecom</s>
<s>i got money from friends coworkers at silicon graphics even my chiropractor</s>
<s>when i raised $150000 i quit silicon graphics and hired a couple of buddies to help me</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was 1999 and we had the same business model of going into stores taking pictures and selling the shoes online</s>
<s>that fall some competitors started to pop up and we thought shoesite wasnt distinctive as a brand</s>
<s>zapatos is spanish for shoes so we added another p to it and made it zappos</s>
<s>we wanted to create something that would be fun and different</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i took meetings with about 10 vc firms</s>
<s>everybody was looking for the next big internet thing but i got nowhere</s>
<s>they said nobodys going to buy shoes without trying them on first</s>
<s>also that we needed someone with experience in the shoe business who could persuade brands to work with us</s>
<s>so one day i called the nordstrom jwn fortune 500 in san francisco and asked to talk to the mens shoes buyer</s>
<s>fred mossler agreed to meet with me</s>
<s>he felt there was an opportunity to do something online but wouldnt commit until i got more money</s>
</p>

<s>i was getting nothing but noes from people and then my attorney art schneiderman said he knew some guys called venture frogs and they would invest in anything</s>
<s>i met with tony hsieh whod just sold his company linkexchange which microsoft msft fortune 500 bought for $295 million in 1998 and he was really enthusiastic</s>
<s>i told him the us footwear market was $40 billion in 1998 and at that time 5 of all the shoes sold were sold through mailorder catalogues</s>
<s>so one out of 20 shoes were already sold through the mail before the internet</s>
<s>a couple of days later tony and his partner alfred lin wrote up a term sheet fred joined us and we were in business</s>
<s>they gave us $500000 initially</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i was probably paying myself $30000 a year in the beginning</s>
<s>at first i was making all the decisions</s>
<s>when tony came onboard he helped a lot with the tech things</s>
<s>in 2001 we became coceos</s>
<s>we integrated the venture frog staff into zappos and tony ended up putting $15 million of his own money into the company</s>
<s>he owned 11 apartments in san francisco and kept selling them to keep zappos open</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was an uphill slog</s>
<s>we always had the feeling it could fall apart</s>
<s>in 2002 draper richards invested $250000 as a convertible note</s>
<s>after a year they wanted their money back and tony had to sell an apartment to do it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we were close to breaking even in 2003 and were growing fast</s>
<s>our sales were $70 million in 2003 $184 million in 2004 $370 million in 2005</s>
<s>but we were still borrowing money to buy inventory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we had huge inventory problems because our approach was to buy everything</s>
<s>a lot of times our buyers would have the brand reps place the order in our system thinking the brand reps would know best what would sell</s>
<s>but then wed be left with a ton of leftover inventory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the company became well known but if the bank lowered our line of credit or if vendors wanted us to pay them faster wed have gone out of business</s>
<s>in 2006 we were doing $597 million in sales but were still making the same 1 or 2 profit</s>
<s>everything was in equity</s>

<p>
<s>when we went for another round of venture capital in 2004 id talk as the ceofounder and tony was making the financial decisions</s>
<s>i told him the ceo needs to be the financial decisionmaker so why dont you be the ceo and ill be the chairmanfounder so investors will know youre the one to deal with</s>
<s> there was never a question of egos</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we moved the company near vegas to henderson nev in 2004 because we were running out of room in our call center and it was hard to find people in san francisco whod work customer service because of the cost of living there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by 2006 i was getting bored</s>
<s>i wanted to be in the trenches with a small company again so i decided to leave</s>
<s>i left with all my stock and still retain ownership in the company</s>
<s>there was no buyout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i started stagr which was an online custom tshirt designer</s>
<s>we signed a deal with madonna right away taking her album artwork and letting people print out the designs on tshirts</s>
<s>it was very successful so we signed fergie ozzy osbourne and others but their stuff didnt sell as well</s>
<s>i guess madonnas fans were just underserved</s>
<s>so after a year i shut the company down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that failure threw me for a loop</s>
<s>it took me a year to stop feeling like i sucked</s>
<s>but with the amazon amzn fortune 500 acquisition of zappos for $12 billion in 2009 i realized that some things work and some things wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after stagr i ended up meeting a guy who managed mixed martial arts fighters so i decided to start dethrone a clothing line catering to fans of ufc ultimate fighting championship</s>
<s>dethrone isnt going to be the biggest brand in the world</s>
<s>its a passion project that im working on with my brother dan</s>
<s>sales are about $13 million a year and its getting close to profitable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fun part is coming up with ideas and trying to turn them into reality</s>
<s>now that im not taking myself too seriously im not afraid to fail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>respond to the customers needs</s>
<s>if a customer called and wanted to buy a certain shoe and we didnt have it wed search the web and send him a link to a place where he could get it</s>
<s>we created free shipping as an incentive  both outbound and return in response to the question what if it doesnt fit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont let other people put a ceiling on what you do</s>
<s>when i worked for the san bernardino stampede they told me itd take years to work my way up through the minor leagues before getting hired for the majors</s>
<s>i ignored them applied anyway and immediately got hired with the san diego padres</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont have a big ego</s>
<s>at zappos everyone saw themselves as equal all working for the same goals</s>
<s>i called myself ceo only because i gave myself the title</s>
<s>youve got to relate to everyone because its a team effort</s>
