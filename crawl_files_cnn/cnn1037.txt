<p>
<s>money magazine  we spoke to five families who face challenges that could keep them from meeting their financial goals</s>
<s>with a few tweaks to their game plan they can get back on course</s>
<s>here the parkers story  and the recommended financial fixes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ed parker never planned on retiring early</s>
<s>but in 2009 at age 61 he was laid off from his job as a manager at a caterpillar dealership and realized he was ready to end fulltime work</s>
<s>his wife roxann had retired a decade earlier from her job at a department store and travel plans beckoned</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to stay busy ed volunteered at a local hospital and was offered a parttime job which gives him an income of $900 a month</s>
<s>the parkers live in an inexpensive area and pay only $265 a month for their mortgage</s>
<s>that habit plus eds income his severance package and taking social security at 62 meant that the couple havent had to tap their retirement savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now that the severance package is finished financial worries are creeping in</s>
<s>they arent sure how much they can afford to withdraw from their savings each year $455000 in two traditional iras and $47000 in a brokerage account when roxann should take social security and whether they can still afford luxuries like a trip to the west indies</s>
<s>we just want to make sure were doing the right thing says ed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though the parkers live simply not having a coherent plan for making withdrawals risks overspending</s>
<s>its important to get this right now says financial planner michele clark of chesterfield mo because the first few years of withdrawals have the biggest impact on the portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the good news is that their 60stock40bond mix is right on target but too big a chunk in intermediateterm bonds leaves them vulnerable to a big drop if interest rates rise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>create a spending plan</s>
<s>at clarks request the parkers came up with a detailed budget for 2012 $45200 for living expenses</s>
<s>subtracting eds posttax social security payment $19143 and salary $10800 means they will need to withdraw $15252 from investment accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats less than 3 of their portfolio  well under the 4 most planners suggest  but other expenses are on the horizon they would like to take that trip to the west indies soon $5000 and within four years will need a new car and camper trailer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tap taxable accounts first</s>
<s>cash out the brokerage account and let the iras continue to grow taxdeferred says clark</s>
<s>the parkers should keep the next years withdrawals in cash and the funds for the following two years in one and twoyear cds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they can fund the west indies trip by dipping into their $13500 cash savings since their expenses are low</s>
<s>thats a relief says ed</s>
<s>the trip seemed like a huge splurge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>diversify the bonds</s>
<s>the parkers fixedincome allocation 38 was nearly all in intermediateterm bonds</s>
<s>cutting that to 20 adding 15 of shortterm bonds and bumping up cash holdings from 3 to 5 should reduce volatility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take social security early</s>
<s>the rule of thumb is to delay taking social security as long as possible but with more than $30000 in expenses coming up for a new car and camper roxann should take it when she qualifies says clark</s>
<s>otherwise they would start depleting their retirement accounts too soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>assuming they follow that plan the parkers have a greater than 80 chance that their funds will last them into their early nineties says clark</s>
<s>sounds good says ed now we dont have to worry anymore</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine is researching an article on ways to reduce the financial pain of college</s>
<s>were looking for families that can talk about new and creative ways that theyre raising cash for college and cutting costs while theyre there</s>
