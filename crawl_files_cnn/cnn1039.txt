<s>switching from hospital administration to special projects has left kathy frederick with more free time for her outings with her husband mike</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  at age 60 kathy frederick routinely put in 50 hours a week as a hospital administrator for scripps health systems in san diego</s>
<s>she managed a 15person staff and regularly took work home on weekends  until one day five years ago she decided enough was enough</s>
<s>i wasnt ready to retire says frederick but after 18 years at that pace i wanted a different challenge and more time for myself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so frederick worked with her boss to create a new role for herself at scripps as a specialprojects manager which allowed her to gradually downshift her hours to her current twodayaweek schedule</s>
<s>frederick is thrilled with the change which shes found reenergizing</s>
<s>im still valued she says but i get to work on my own terms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>frederick is one of a growing number of fifty and sixtysomethings who arent ready to quit work but would like to cut back  in fact four out of 10 people 50 and older say theyd like to gradually reduce their work hours as they age according to an aarp survey</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some love what they do but are tired of the hectic pace and long hours</s>
<s>others would be happy to bid the job adios but cant afford to give up a regular salary benefits or the chance to build a bigger nest egg</s>
<s>employers are warming to the idea of workers phasing in retirement too since it allows them to save money on some of their longesttenure read most expensive staffers without losing that expertise entirely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sound appealing</s>
<s>whether easing up at work makes sense for you depends on your finances  can you afford to live on less now</s>
<s>will it hurt your retirement lifestyle later</s>
<s> and also on the nature of your work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to decide start with a cleareyed assessment of your prospects</s>
<s>the challenge if you opt to move ahead will be to craft a new role that lightens your load without damaging your longterm security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is your current job doable on a reduced schedule or can you reinvent your role in a way that will allow you to work at a less pressured pace</s>
<s>and do you work for the kind of employer that will be receptive to the idea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those are the first questions to ask yourself</s>
<s>the answers will depend in part on your companys culture and on your standing within the organization  as well as on your ability to think critically and creatively about your role</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>build on precedent</s>
<s>your employer probably doesnt have a formal phasedretirement program few do</s>
<s>but if the company already has other kinds of flexible work options in place  parttime schedules say or telecommuting arrangements  you can model your proposal on them</s>
<s>a variation on a working arrangement that managers are familiar with and know can succeed will get a better reception than a concept theyve never heard of</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the approach taken by ken bottoms a compensation executive at first horizon national a financial services company in memphis who decided he wanted to cut back at work three years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i enjoyed my job and there were still things i wanted to accomplish but i didnt feel i needed to be in the office five days a week to do them he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although first horizon didnt have a formal program for transitioning to retirement the company did allow employees who were caring for children or older relatives to work as little as 20 hours a week and still retain full benefits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so bottoms now 66 used that blueprint to work out a deal to gradually downshift from 40plus hours a week to 30 working on special projects as he handed off responsibilities to his eventual replacement</s>
<s>the transition enabled bottoms to keep health benefits until he qualified for medicare hold off taking social security until full retirement age and get his financial house in order he and his wife paid off their mortgage and downsized to a smaller home before quitting work for good last fall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>leverage your position and skills</s>
<s>if your job involves being part of a team project work or shift work the way many health care professionals are scheduled for example you may have a leg up because its easier to peel away some responsibilities</s>
<s>your boss may also be more eager to accommodate you if the company has a large number of highly skilled hardtoreplace staffers like engineers scientists or longtenure workers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>companies would rather develop a new role to hang on to their most valued employees than have them walk suddenly out the door says alan steinberg a partner in aon hewitts retirement practice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>case in point aerospace corp a nonprofit in el segundo calif that provides technical and scientific research for federal government agencies</s>
<s>mindful that the average age of its employees is 51 and that a third of the staff is eligible for retirement aerospace has approved phasedretirement plans for about 10 of its 3900strong workforce</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a way for us to keep technical knowledge that would be hard to replace quickly says hr general manager charlotte lazarmorrison</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one beneficiary of that policy is engineer grant aufderhaar 63 who until last spring was aerospaces director of technology</s>
<s>after 18 years with the nonprofit aufderhaar gave up his title and fulltime position and now takes on only special assignments most recently a technologyinvesting plan</s>
<s>he retains an office and health benefits but puts in just a fraction of his former hours</s>
<s>im working on projects with real impact and im still being asked my opinion which is nice says aufderhaar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>know your personal value</s>
<s>no one is going to cut you a special deal if youre not highly regarded  mere competence wont cut it you need to be a real standout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a study by robert hutchens for the center for retirement research at boston college confirms the factors that make employers more willing to say yes to a phased retirement proposal long service 10 years or more a reputation for being productive and a work style that needs less supervision than most</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>employers dont want everyone to stay says jamie hale a workforceplanning consultant at towers watson</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure it sounds great to work less</s>
<s>but can you really afford to take a pay cut in your peak earning years</s>
<s>the last thing you want is to lighten up now only to learn later on when fulltime work may no longer be an option that doing so undermined your financial security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>give living on less a test run</s>
<s>in the standard phasedretirement arrangement your salary will be prorated for the hours you work</s>
<s>so if you go from putting in five days a week to four say youll earn 80 of your salary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can play with the numbers on paper all you want but to really know whether you can swing it theres no substitute for trying to live on that lower salary for a while  before you make a move at work that may not be reversible says dallas financial planner richard jackson</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that exercise was an eyeopener for kathy heatherton who went through it six years ago</s>
<s>at the time heatherton then 62 was a vice president at a construction trade association in des moines earning $75000 a year and her desire to go from fulltime to three days a week would have cut her pay by 40</s>
<s>worried about whether she and her husband mike a retired postal worker could get by on that pay plus his pension and his social security heatherton sought help from a financial planner</s>
<s>his advice reduce spending ahead of time to see if they could swing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so the heathertons created their first budget cutting back on items like vacations and clothes and then lived on that lower income for a year before deciding they could indeed manage if kathy downshifted</s>
<s>the hardest part giving up going out to lunch with friends at work</s>
<s> says heatherton who switched to working in quality assurance to accommodate her new schedule i would never have had the confidence to do this unless we lived it first</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont sweat saving less</s>
<s>a lower salary likely means that your 401k contributions will also fall  that is if you can afford to save at all</s>
<s>that neednt be a deal breaker</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reason most of the growth in your account value in the past few years before retirement comes from the compounding of earnings on money youve already invested not from new contributions</s>
<s>reducing savings during the transition years is far less of a problem than starting to draw down your savings says christine fahlund a senior financial planner at t rowe price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed a study by t rowe found that an employee who earned $100000 a year and shifted from five to four days a week at age 60 resulting in a 20 cut in salary and retirement savings would end up with virtually as much retirement income as someone who works fulltime to 65  as long as that employee doesnt have to start taking social security benefits or tapping savings to make ends meet</s>
