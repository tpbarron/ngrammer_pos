<p>
<s>meghann at home on maternity leave with their two sons juggled 32 showings in the first month</s>
<s>its so exhausting trying to find somewhere to go for an hour two or three times a day she says</s>
<s>the battles even installed a special frontdoor handle to text them when buyers enter and exit so that they can return as soon as possible</s>
<s>its just crazy she says</s>

<p>
<s>wait isnt the real estate market still supposed to stink after five straight years of falling prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>turns out that while analysts debate when the market will hit bottom for a surprising number of cities the turnaround has already begun</s>
<s>in december prices rose in 109 of the 384 metro areas tracked by the data firm corelogic</s>
<s>scrub out foreclosures and that figure climbs to 169</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you think that recovery means a return to the booms doubledigit price increases forget about it</s>
<s>the market wont suddenly snap back warns corelogic economist sam khater who has studied past housing busts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and for harderhit areas such as central florida and the rustbelt improving may simply mean things are less bad than they were two years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no matter where you live though  or where you want to live next  the strategies you employ to sell your home must change to reflect the realities of whats now a healing market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to see how that change might play out money visited denver ranked by corelogic as the most improved of the nations 100 largest markets</s>

<p>
<s>prices in the mile high city and its suburbs which didnt experience the extreme booms or busts of phoenix or las vegas rose in december</s>
<s>foreclosures are ebbing</s>
<s>and homes are selling about 19 faster than they were a year ago</s>

<p>
<s>our tour of this recovering market reveals that the rebound is likely to creep rather than surge ahead</s>

<p>
<s>see if your town is near recovery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many economists predict that 2012 will be the last year overall housing prices decline as the final wave of foreclosures from the slump hits the market</s>
<s>after that prices should inch up 2 in 2013 3 in 2014 according to a consensus of analysts tallied by moodys economycom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why</s>
<s>against a backdrop of low mortgage rates employment has improved slightly and home prices have fallen long and hard enough that buyers are beginning to realize that they wont necessarily lose their shirts by purchasing real estate</s>
<s>to see if your neighborhood is on the verge of a rebound you have to look for the signs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for instance is local employment on the upswing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a critical factor for a region to get itself on the path to recovery</s>
<s>the improving jobs picture has led to shrinking housing stock across the country as enough investors and bargain hunters have come on the scene to unclog the glut of foreclosures thats been blocking a recovery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also builders are not putting up very many new homes says celia chen who follows housing for economycom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in denver the improved job market has led not only to falling inventory but also a boost in buying activity and an uptick in prices</s>
<s>during the lean years denver like many other regions was hit by both falling prices and rising foreclosures though the suburbs far from the city center  where construction of new homes exploded  bore a disproportionate amount of pain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today however distressed properties make up around 30 of the denver metro market compared with 45 at the trough says local real estate analyst gary bauer</s>
<s>and the number of homes on the market has fallen to lows not seen since 2000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>understand the buyers psychology</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sellers arent the only ones whove been affected by the bust</s>
<s>for years buyers were scared to death of overpaying for a home</s>
<s>theyre less so now but theyve grown accustomed to thinking that theyll score deals so they tend to act slowly and typically start bidding around 10 to 15 below list price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>denver real estate agent ron buss says he sees this all the time with clients such as aaron blankenship who lost 10 when he sold his home in rochester ny last year to move to denver for a new job with molson coors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>blankenship 37 is biding his time renting as he looks for a new home</s>
<s>im much more riskconscious he says</s>
<s>its a challenge figuring out how much we really want to spend and how much we really want to be tied to our home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cautiousness is not just in peoples heads</s>
<s>lenders are still stingy about approving mortgages and buyers must be sure that whatever price they offer will pass muster with the appraiser and the bank</s>
<s>its been a little better in the last few quarters but credit will take five years to sort itself out says economycoms chen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still a growing number of buyers realize that if they wait too long in this market they may miss out</s>
<s>charles roberts coowner of a 400agent brokerage in denver points out that his group oversaw 155 closings in february  the highest number in eight years</s>

<p>
<s>you can hold firm on price if youre patient</s>
<s>the days of having to deal with lowball offers are coming to an end</s>
<s>ask deanna white</s>
<s>the divorced mother of two says she didnt need to sell her home in the denver suburb of highlands ranch she simply wanted to</s>
<s>white no longer required four bedrooms and three bathrooms and she didnt enjoy spending the time left after frequent business travel on yard work and household chores</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in july the house next door smaller than whites sold for its list price of $337000 in three weeks</s>
<s>in august a threebedroom down the street went for $341700 in five days</s>
<s>so in the fall white 41 decided to go for it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i knew i had a good lot with a view of open range she says</s>
<s>i said heres the deal</s>
<s>were going to do this but im willing to ride it out because i dont have to move</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>her home listed at $365000 attracted offers of around $330000</s>
<s>white didnt bite though she adjusted her price to $359000</s>
<s>after a holiday lull activity exploded</s>
<s>i had barely put up the christmas decorations and i couldnt get into my house she recalls</s>
<s>white agreed to sell for $354000</s>
<s>she moves in april into a newly built smaller home nearby</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the higher your price the more patient you must be</s>
<s>cheaper homes are affordable to more buyers and appealing to investors so recoveries usually start there</s>
<s>two years ago denver properties above $210000 were still falling</s>
<s>at the end of 2011 it was homes above $315000</s>
<s>also jumbo mortgages that arent governmentguaranteed  loans above $417000 and up to $625500 in highcost areas like new york  not only charge higher rates they come with tougher underwriting standards further slowing things down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>screen your buyers</s>
<s>working only with buyers preapproved for a sufficient mortgage has long been standard advice</s>
<s>but with more offers rolling in a good agent will call loan officers for more information</s>
<s>theres an incentive for borrowers to grant their loan officer permission to talk</s>
<s>if im going to speak with a listing agent to advocate on my borrowers behalf i clear it with the borrower first says mortgage consultant kym poladsky</s>
<s>most borrowers who are competing want you to help get their offer accepted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>strike the right balance on pricing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while you dont have to placate lowballers anymore you cant shoot for the moon either</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>adele work and jennifer caldwell can attest to that</s>
<s>the couple have lived in their 1910 home in the desirable washington park neighborhood near downtown denver for the past 12 years</s>
<s>they werent thinking of selling their place until they happened upon a farm in northern colorado last august while visiting their son in college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they wound up buying that property and put their washington park baby on the market in october for $734999  even though their agent lobbied for a lower price</s>
<s>sure enough the buyers feedback started to come in love the house but slightly overpriced</s>
<s> so they cut the price tag to $714000</s>
<s>in february they dropped it again to $699000</s>
<s>if we had priced our house lower to begin with we maybe would have sold it before the end of the year caldwell says</s>
<s>adds work weve let our heart lead us a bit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>get it right the first time</s>
<s>set a realistic price from the getgo so your house doesnt look like a throwback to lousy priceslashing times</s>
<s>to do that think like an appraiser</s>
<s>analyze comparable sales for pricepersquarefoot and see how long competing homes have been on the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>scouting active listings is also crucial says appraiser matthew george</s>
<s>you have to know what youre competing against he says</s>
<s>arm yourself with a simplified evaluation of your home called a summary or restricteduse appraisal before listing $150 to $200</s>
<s>to find professionals in your area go to appraisalinstituteorg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you think you erred in pricing act quickly and decisively</s>
<s>are you getting lots of showings but still no offers after 30 days on the market</s>
<s>cut the price by at least $10000 says justin knoll chairman of the denver realtors organization</s>
<s>at that point you can hold firm on price and try to negotiate offers up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>let your homes value dictate the price</s>
<s>this advice may seem selfevident but owners may have lost sight of it during the bust</s>
<s>on the one hand some sellers clung to the false hope of a return to boom prices so they set prices unrealistically high</s>
<s>others may have gone too far the other way  by setting the price on their higherend home below jumbo loan levels simply to draw more interest</s>
<s>in an improving market that type of thinking isnt really necessary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>understand that youre no long competing with gutted foreclosures</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>buyers are tired of looking at worndown neglected distressed properties and often dont have much extra money to do a lot of fixing up</s>
<s>clients tell me all the time ill spend a little more for something thats ready to move into  says knoll</s>
<s>sellers need to take advantage of that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take care of structural and cosmetic necessities  but not much more</s>
<s>in lean times forking over $50000 on a new kitchen may have seemed like a necessary move to stand out</s>
<s>thats probably the wrong thing to do now says george the appraiser</s>
<s>instead stick with basics like paint and flooring</s>
<s>and fix things that will come up in inspection</s>
<s>for instance kathy and bruce frank of golden colo recently spent $1600 to repair a sunken driveway before they put their house on the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in their 28 years there the franks  shes a retired elementary school principal he works at the university of colorado  have done a little of this and a lot of that</s>
<s>finished the basement popped the top on the garage and added a master suite new hardwood floors moved the laundry room to the top floor new roof she says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the empty nesters listed their home they focused on small stuff like decluttering and packing up their personal stuff</s>
<s>they also brought in a stager to set the kitchen and dining room tables</s>
<s>the franks agent buss says the house is shipshape but admits it reflects the longtime owners tastes</s>
<s>blue he says</s>
<s>the house is very blue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>respond quickly to feedback</s>
<s>if an issue arises over and over in buyers reactions it needs to be addressed immediately</s>
<s>buss for instance planned on giving the franks 10 days or 10 showings</s>
<s>if buyers complained about the blue he was going to have them paint</s>
<s>it turned out not to be necessary</s>
<s>just three days after listing the franks had a fullprice offer $375000</s>
<s>theyre under contract</s>
