<s>european council president herman van rompuy has outlined sweeping reforms for the troubled euro currency union</s>
<s>but implementing his visionthing is going to be a longterm process</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  european union leaders took a step forward on the path toward a banking union at their latest summit but they delayed more politically fraught decisions until the next meeting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after a late night discussion in brussels thursday eu leaders committed to a jan 1 deadline to hammer out details for a single supervisory mechanism for eurozone banks which they said will be implemented some time next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the legislation would give the european central bank the ability to oversee the regions roughly 6000 banks in addition to its existing mandate to manage interest rates and contain inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>establishing the single supervisor is a prerequisite for the ultimate goal of recapitalizing banks in the euro area with bailout funds from the european stability mechanism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in theory the esm would be able to inject capital directly into banks without driving governments deeper into debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is particularly important for spain which has already requested up to €100 billion to help fill the €59 billion hole left in the nations banking sector by a major property bust</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>ireland where the government was bailed out in 2010 after assuming much of the nations bank debt also stands to benefit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there are many thorny questions that need to be resolved before the legislation can be written into law let alone implemented</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for one the ecb is a eurozone institution and it remains unclear whether it will have authority over banks in eu nations that do not use the single currency</s>
<s>britain in particular is uncomfortable with this idea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a statement eu leaders stressed the need for a single rulebook</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is also the question of socalled legacy assets</s>
<s>officials from germany finland and denmark suggested last month that bailout funds should only be used to repay future bank debt rather than resolve existing banking problems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more germany and other eu nations appear to be at odds over the scope of the supervisors authority</s>
<s>berlin reportedly wants the supervisor to focus only on systemically important banks as opposed to the smaller institutions that hold much of the bad debt in the eurozone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are still major obstacles on the path to full banking union in the eurozone said jonathan loynes chief european economist at capital economics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beyond the banking union eu leaders pledged to continue working on more integrated budget policies as well as steps to boost economic growth and create jobs</s>

<p>
<s>eurozone leaders welcomed the progress greece has made in talks with international creditors saying friday that finance ministers will make a decision on additional rescue funds for greece once that nations lender have completed their review</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the lack of progress on these issues has raised the stakes for the next eu summit in december according to fitch ratings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fitch said prolonged delays on structural reforms could damage the credibility of policy makers efforts to solve the eurozone crisis and increase the eurozones vulnerability to market pressure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still the agency said a short delay would be manageable thanks to the ecbs recent commitment to buy potentially unlimited amounts of sovereign debt a move that has calmed the markets since september</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spain in particular has benefited from the promise of ecb intervention in the bond market where yields on the 10year bond have moved closer to 5 from the lofty 7 levels seen in july</s>
<s>it also remains to be seen if the spanish government would agree to the ecbs conditions which include committing to a formal bailout program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ecb continues to hold the fort said nicholas spiro director of londonbased consultancy spiro sovereign strategy</s>
<s>but the eurozone crisis has entered a more political phase in which the future of the single currency area hinges on farreaching institutional reforms</s>
