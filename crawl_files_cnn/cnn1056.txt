<s>new york cnnmoney  greece took a step back from the brink this weekend but the nation faces a long road to recovery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite the victory of a probailout political party in sundays election the final composition of the next greek government has yet to be determined</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once a government is formed regardless of which party is in charge the first task will be to renegotiate the terms of greeces bailout program</s>
<s>that will be difficult to say the least and could take weeks if not months to accomplish</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words the outlook for greece is highly uncertain and the nations political and economic crisis is far from over</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>forming a government the first challenge will be for greek politicians to come together and form a government something they failed to do last month under very similar circumstances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new democracy one of the political parties that signed off on greeces bailout program in march won 129 seats in the greek parliament</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but it fell short of claiming a majority in greeces 300seat parliament</s>
<s>that means new democracy will need to join forces with at least one other party to form a viable government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the most likely candidate is the socialist pasok party which came in third on sunday with 33 seats in parliament</s>
<s>together new democracy and pasok would have a majority</s>
<s>the coalition could be strengthened if another party democratic left agrees to join</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however analysts say pasok party leader evangelos venizelos wants the farleft syriza party to be included in any governing coalition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>syriza which has threatened to renege on the terms of the bailout came in second in the election with 71 seats in parliament</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the concern is that pasok will refuse to join forces with new democracy if syriza is not included</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>starting monday new democracy has three days to form a government</s>
<s>if it fails syriza will be given the same threeday deadline</s>
<s>if syriza fails pasok will be next in line</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the event that no government is formed greece could hold a third election</s>
<s>but analysts say there is no political appetite in greece for a third election suggesting the parties have a strong incentive to cooperate</s>

<p>
<s>bailout renegotiation any government that comes to power is expected to immediately begin renegotiating the terms of the nations bailout program with its international creditors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are signs that the european union international monetary fund and european central bank collectively known as the troika are willing to make concessions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a statement issued sunday the eurogroup of euro area finance ministers said the troika looks forward to an exchange of views with the greek government once it is formed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the immediate goal is to give greece more time to meet its fiscal targets including a deadline at the end of june to identify additional budget cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however allowing greece more time to meet its targets could cause the government to run in arrears meaning it will go deeper into debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition the greek economy has taken a turn for the worse since the bailout agreement was signed in march</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the combination of weakerthanexpected economic performance and additional debt means greece could soon need more bailout money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>analysts at political research firm eurasia group estimate that greece could have between €20 billion to €30 billion in additional funding needs depending on how the terms are restructured</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while the troika may be willing to cut greece some slack by delaying reforms it may not be willing to sign off on a third bailout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the renegotiation process is expected to take at least three weeks</s>
<s>but it could take longer depending on how things play out in the netherlands</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dutch government collapsed in april and the nation may not agree to any concessions for greece until after elections are held in midseptember</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is a chance that negotiations could drag out until the end of august when greece is due to make a €31 billion bond payment according analysts at barclays</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in that case greece and the eu would have to negotiate how to make the payment possibly through a bridge loan from the efsf wrote the barclays analysts referring to the eurozone bailout fund </s>
