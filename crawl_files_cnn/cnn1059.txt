<s>ecb president mario draghi is offered up details about a new bondbuying program to help stem europes debt crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  european central bank president mario draghi outlined the details of a plan to buy euro area government bonds reiterating his pledge to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>following a meeting of top ecb officials in frankfurt on thursday draghi said the ecb is prepared to make outright monetary transactions or omts in the secondary bond market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the goal is to address severe distortions in government bond markets which he said stem from unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he said the omts will be subject to conditions including the activation of the two eurozone rescue funds  european financial stability facility or european stability mechanism</s>
<s>in other words governments that want the ecb to buy its bonds must agree to a program of reforms and oversight by the bailout funds and possibly the international monetary fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the move is aimed mainly at spain and italy which struggled with unsustainable borrowing costs earlier this year although draghi said the offer is open to all euro area governments</s>
<s>so far neither madrid or rome has officially requested support from the bailout funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there will be no ex ante limits on the size of the purchases said draghi calling the plan a fully effective back stop that removes tail risks from the euro area</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the purchases will focus on bonds with a duration of between 1 and 3 years</s>
<s>and draghi said the ecb will not be considered a preferred creditor under the new program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors welcomed the comments with stock markets rallying in europe and the united states</s>
<s>in the bond market yields on spanish and italian bonds fell sharply</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related european stocks rise on ecb</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a very significant step for the ecb said marie diron senior economic adviser to the ernst  young</s>
<s>the ecb did not disappoint on the very high expectations in the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>diron praised the ecb for being proactive but she added that the new program alone is not enough for the eurozone economy to turn itself around</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the program certainly improves the financial market environment and will create some room for governments to hold up their part of the bargain she said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>during his press conference draghi said conditionality is the most important difference between the omts and past interventions in the bond market under the ecbs securities market program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ecb president stressed that intervening in the bond market is not effective without concurrent policy actions by government policy makers</s>
<s>you need two legs he said</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>guy lebas chief fixed income analyst at janney capital markets called the emphasis on conditionality a sacrifice to the german financial gods</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>essentially if a bailed out country doesnt meet its fiscal target the ecb stops buying and borrowing rates go through the roof lebas wrote in a note to clients</s>
<s>it also allows the ecb an out which reduces the effectiveness of the purchase program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the decision was backed by all members of the ecbs governing council with one exception</s>
<s>jens weidmann president of the german bundesbank has made his opposition to bond buying publicly known</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi reiterated his argument that bond buying is not a violation of the ecbs mandate because dysfunctional financial markets are impeding the transmission of monetary policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however he downplayed reports that ecb leaders are divided along geographic lines with more hawkish northerners opposed to more dovish southerners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is a mistaken caricature particularly in this country germany about how the governing council works he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile the ecb said its main refinancing rate will remain at a record low of 075</s>
<s>some analysts had expected a rate cut to 05</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ecb also lowered its outlook for economic growth this year to a range between a decline of 06 and 02</s>
