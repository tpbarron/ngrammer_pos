</p>

<p>
<s>home prices climbed 22 compared with a month earlier according to the spcaseshiller 20city home price index</s>
<s>prices are still off 07 compared with may 2011 but thats the lowest yearoveryear decline in 18 months according to david blitzer a spokesman for sp</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the report gave support for industry experts who have been saying that the longawaited housing market recovery is underway</s>
<s>but blitzer sounded a note of caution</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we need to remember that spring and early summer are seasonally strong buying months so this trend must continue throughout the summer and into the fall he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>adjusted for seasonal effect the price gain shrank to 09 but thats still a strong increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the roller coaster ride for home prices took them up 1065 between january 2000 and their high of july 2006</s>
<s>after they peaked prices lost more than 34 of their value</s>
<s>the gains of the last two months have pared that loss to 33</s>

<p>
<s>investor money has come in to some of the hardhit markets like phoenix and florida cities said mike larson a real estate analyst with weiss research</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that has helped stabilize housing by shrinking inventory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an ongoing change in the mix of homes sold may be contributing to improving prices according to stan humphries chief economist for real estate website zillow</s>
<s>fewer homes are going as foreclosures which banks discount heavily to move quickly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>short sales are claiming a bigger market share according to david crowe chief economist for the national association of home builders</s>
<s>theyre often in better condition than foreclosures and the selling process plays out more like conventional sales</s>
<s>prices as a result are higher for short sales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the strength of the gains was unexpected</s>
<s>a panel of experts put together by briefingcom had projected a yearoveryear decline of 18 but the big jump in may prices led to the more modest 07 dip</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>larson pointed out that caseshiller is a lagging housing market indicator</s>
<s>it is a threemonth rolling average through the end of may so some of the data is almost five months old</s>
<s>back then the overall economy seemed to be on the upswing and unemployment was dropping</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those improvements have flattened out</s>
<s>the unemployment rate actually ticked up in may to 82 and stayed at that level in june</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>momentum will fade as we enter the summer months said larson</s>
<s>the broad economy cant seem to generate much growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>crowe said that there has also been a fundamental change in market confidence</s>
<s>buyers are beginning to believe the market has hit bottom and that the time to buy is now especially with mortgage rates at historic lows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>humphries said there could be ups and downs during the next six months but buyers should not be overly concerned about that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this will be a function of seasonality in the share of sales that are foreclosures which will rise as overall sales decline in the fall and winter he said</s>
<s>overall we remain cautiously optimistic that home values are at a bottom nationally even while our expectations for price appreciation in the next couple of years are muted</s>
