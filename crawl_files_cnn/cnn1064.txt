<s>money magazine  after three years of belttightening tom van de water 41 a customer information systems manager in stratham nh has finally loosened the family budget</s>
<s>this year he and his wife alyson 41 celebrated their 10th anniversary in st lucia and she bought him a pricey watch for his birthday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>are these signs of a return to the freespending good old days when the couple wouldnt have hesitated to buy the best stuff and top off one of their frequent dinners out with an expensive bottle of wine</s>
<s>not by a long shot</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today the couple who have three children ages 8 7 and 18 months carefully plan outings</s>
<s>we treat each time as special van de water says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the familys suv a 2007 honda pilot was purchased off a usedcar lot and their maple dining room set was a $900 bargain nabbed on craigslist</s>
<s>were more thoughtful about how we spend he says</s>
<s>were realigning our values</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so are a lot of people</s>
<s>since 2008 the worst economic downturn since the great depression has dramatically changed the way millions of families manage their money and their lives</s>
<s>some actions were predictable like cutting up credit cards clipping coupons and suddenly remembering that yes you really do need to save for a rainy day</s>
<s>what you were living through after all was a downpour of financial troubles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now more than three years after the collapse of financial institutions stock prices and home values combined to usher in a new age of austerity enough time has passed to ask a critical question which of our newfound habits and values will really stick lasting even after the economy rebounds  and which wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the great recession officially ended in june 2009</s>
<s>the recovery has been anemic at best  in fact 80 of americans believe the country is still in recession according to a recent gallup poll  and the threat of a double dip hangs over us like a swollen storm cloud</s>
<s>that alone suggests that at least some of the behavioral shifts will stay in place for some time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>big periods of economic upheaval can define a generation says paul flatters managing partner of trajectory partnership which monitors consumer behavior</s>
<s>not so much because of the depth of this recession but because of its prolonged nature it will have lasting impact</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to help define the new normal money and our sister publication time collaborated on a pair of wideranging surveys in late summer to explore americans changing financial values</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the polls were a followup to surveys taken in the months immediately before and after the 2008 meltdown</s>
<s>in dozens of interviews many families like the van de waters reported that they were relenting on kneejerk resolutions made at the height of the crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after all never ever eating out again is probably unrealistic and theres a limit to how long youll shop only sales watch free tv and read at the library</s>
<s>still a great many folks are also doubling down on big behavioral shifts like quality time with family and saving more for retirement  two areas where the readings today are even higher than they were at the deepest point of the pullback</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the money poll one in five said they were financially better off now than they were a year ago</s>
<s>that isnt exactly a landslide of prosperity</s>
<s>it is however twice the rate of those who felt that way in the 2008 survey</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>higher earners households with an annual income of at least $75000 not surprisingly were even more likely to report improvement and folks across the income spectrum have a higher degree of optimism about their personal finances in the coming 12 months than they did three years ago</s>
<s>far more now have confidence they will hang on to their house and fewer worry that theyll be forced to accept a pay cut</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of this is to minimize lingering pain</s>
<s>median household earnings have fallen three years in a row according to the census bureau and the poverty rate is the highest its been in nearly 20 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the time poll 83 feel americans have less economic security than they did 10 years ago more worry about whether theyd be able to find work if they lost their job and greater numbers report dipping into college or retirement savings to make ends meet than was the case three years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>collective optimism has also been dinged</s>
<s>people who live through an economic shock have far less confidence in government for most of their life according to a national bureau of economic research nber study</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the money survey confirms this skepticism only 34 were optimistic about the presidents ability to restore growth and 17 were optimistic about congress</s>
<s>true the survey was conducted shortly after the august debt ceiling battle when many were especially fed up with government</s>
<s>still people overall are clearly more pessimistic about the economy now than three years ago even as they are starting to feel better about their own finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this split between cautious personal optimism and deep concern for the country is one of many profound shifts in financial attitudes over the past three years revealed in the money and time surveys</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here are other key findings that shed light on where americans stand now and where they think theyre headed when it comes to managing their money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thrift is in vogue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the past three years a taste for designer labels  so 2007  has morphed into a penchant for spotting deals</s>
<s>and living within your means has become cool again</s>
<s>or at least youve noticed your friends and neighbors have swung around to your way of thinking</s>
<s>the new appreciation for bargains and budgets born during the 2008 financial crisis appears to have become even deeper in 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the money survey nearly half the respondents said they felt guilty when they purchased a luxury product and 85 spend more time looking for deals before they buy  higher readings than in the earlier poll</s>
<s>and 83 were convinced they would remain frugal in the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two in three said their financial priorities have changed as well</s>
<s>how</s>
<s>lots of folks are building an emergency fund 57 putting less focus on material things 64 and eating at home more often 80</s>
<s>that attitude adjustment has put a big crimp in consumer spending which has been flat for the past three years according to the bureau of economic analysis</s>
<s>people now think two three four times before they spend says flatters</s>
<s>marketers have to convince them the purchase is not frivolous</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a preoccupation with value is likely to persist in part because the next set of consumers young people have felt the squeeze too</s>
<s>dominant beliefs about how society and the economy work are formed from ages 18 to 25 the nber study found</s>
<s>this age group has suffered the sharpest income drop  median earnings of those ages 15 to 24 fell 9 last year  and have been among the hardest hit by unemployment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as if that wasnt searing enough many young people experienced the trauma of watching their parents lose their jobs and homes take pay cuts or suffer big drops in home values and retirement accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these kinds of setbacks leave emotional scars says james burroughs associate professor at the mcintire school of commerce</s>
<s>students saw their parents get wiped out after working so hard he says</s>
<s>to them it all seems like a futile exercise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so they are likely to place a lasting value on more moderate living with an emphasis on relationships and experiences</s>
<s>says burroughs they have a much greater awareness that money cannot buy happiness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>family time trumps stuff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the money survey 75 said spending time with family was more important than ever up from 69 three years ago suggesting many folks have tried it liked it and are determined to stick to it</s>
<s>and more than half said theyll continue to be more focused on relationships than material gain well into the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>holly rasmussen 42 a business consultant and divorced mother of two children in parker colo is one of them</s>
<s>to save money after she was forced to take a pay cut during the recession she got rid of her landline and home fax downgraded her cable package and dumped the gym membership</s>
<s>her most rewarding shift she says has been quitting the restaurant habit which has helped her overhaul her relationship with her kids ages 13 and 11</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we have more time together because were not sitting in a restaurant with people being ushered in and out she says</s>
<s>were in our living room and its just the three of us talking about our day</s>
<s>we know each other better</s>
<s> rasmussen says the family now plan meals and cook together often</s>
<s>she figures her quality time with the kids has doubled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shes also teaching them to be smart about money</s>
<s>like the 58 in the money poll who are asking their offspring to be more careful about what they spend rasmussen now puts the children on a budget when they go shopping giving them a limited amount to spend as they see fit</s>
<s>she says almost instantly they went from wanting the best of the best to hey look at these five shirts i can get on the sale rack</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors are wary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite the markets volatility over the past three years investors arent abandoning stocks and most dont expect big price drops in the near future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats particularly true among higher earners just 16 of families earning $75000 or more believe the market will be lower a year from now</s>
<s>investors however arent reverting to big bets on tech and other highfliers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead theyre hunkering down looking for ways to minimize losses down the road</s>
<s>half of affluent families have focused on diversifying their assets over the past three years the money survey found</s>
<s>a telling 43 said they were more concerned with capital preservation than gains and nearly 30 said this shift is permanent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that describes richard anklins revamped strategy to a tee</s>
<s>anklin 64 and his wife sharon 65 both retired built a $13 million nest egg during 30plusyear careers working at ford by investing largely in stocks and sticking with them through the ups and downs of the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though their investment mix was aggressive for their age they stayed the course through the recent downturn their stocks lost 40 after the 2008 crash  expecting their portfolio to bounce back as it had so many times before</s>
<s>but three years later their holdings are still down sharply</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>worried by the duration of the downturn and their advancing years the couple is now making major shifts in their portfolio</s>
<s>theyre dialing back on stocks and have annuitized part of their savings to produce steady income  smart moves since theyre in retirement</s>
<s>as a result though their projected income from their investments has dropped by a third and richard is concerned about whether he and sharon will be able to maintain their standard of living and help put four grandkids through college as he planned</s>
<s>but i had to do it richard says</s>
<s>i had to protect my principal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>austerity has eased up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>debt played a big role in getting the country into this mess and eliminating debt on both a national and personal level seems key to getting out of it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>washington may be stuck on figuring out the first part but families are bent on cleaning up their own balance sheets</s>
<s>the credit bureau transunion reports that credit card debt this year has fallen to a near decadelong low averaging $4700 per borrower</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the money poll 62 said they are intent on paying down their credit cards  a far greater number than in the 2009 survey</s>
<s>people are putting their heads down and systematically paying off debt in ways ive not seen in 30 years says mark cole chief operating officer of credability a nonprofit credit counseling agency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lately though there has been some backtracking</s>
<s>even as theyre paying off cards people seem more willing to use them in the money survey only 43 say they no longer carry a balance down from 63 three years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>justreleased federal reserve data also show a spike in charging by consumers during the second quarter although credit card debt overall remains sharply lower than 2008s record levels</s>
<s>saving rates show a similar pattern currently 5 theyre down from a postcrisis peak of 71 in may 2009 but still way better than the nearzero rate of prerecession days</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats going on</s>
<s>some experts believe consumers are finally finding a sustainable middle ground</s>
<s>after all its tough to live like a monk forever</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>case in point karen dhanie 38 whose family cut way back on everything from groceries to vacations after she was laid off in 2009 from her job in regional sales with citigroup</s>
<s>now working for home depot in orlando dhanie says she and her husband harry 43 a manager at a national pharmacy chain got fed up with a lesser cellphone plan and upgraded</s>
<s>she no longer drives out of her way to get a better price on everyday purchases</s>
<s>but she says we still are very conscious about what we buy</s>
<s>were not splurging like before</s>
<s>our vacations are less luxurious</s>
<s>we plan ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why new habits will last</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cole thinks families like the dhanies will stick with the program</s>
<s>consumer willingness to spend and borrow he says is a function of job security and confidence in the economy both abysmally low now and likely to stay low for a long while</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he says shedding debt is like quitting cigarettes</s>
<s>once you kick the habit you get religion and strive not only to avoid future debt but also to pass this wisdom on to your kids</s>

<p>
<s>robert kaplan a professor at the harvard business school agrees noting a rare double whammy both government and consumers are pulling in their horns</s>
<s>this creates enormous economic headwinds he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not everyone sees all the changes as lasting</s>
<s>scott hoyt an economist at moodys analytics who has studied the recessions effect on consumers believes people generally will continue to save more and borrow less but that theyll start spending again once the economy get stronger</s>
<s>consumers make these changes cyclically he says</s>
<s>he notes that restaurant spending perked up as the economy improved last year only to fall off a cliff again when things got dicey this summer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats clear the longer tough conditions continue the more folks accept it as normal which in turn serves to cement their new values</s>
<s>theres a huge shift of people who now say this is the way its going to be forever  or at least a long long time says carl van horn a professor of public policy at rutgers</s>
