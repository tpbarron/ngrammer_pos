<s>economists surveyed by cnnmoney are predicting the economy grew at a 14 rate in the second quarter as weak consumer spending dragged on the recovery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the recovery is slow because youre not spending enough money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at least thats what economists say</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on friday the government will release its secondquarter report on gross domestic product and economists surveyed by cnnmoney are predicting a 14 annual rate of growth</s>
<s>that would be down significantly from 19 growth in the first three months of the year</s>
<s>the biggest drag isnt likely to come from europes debt crisis or chinas slowdown but from weak consumer spending at home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the outlook is very bleak from a consumers perspective said wells fargo economist sam bullard</s>
<s>were seeing such weak job and income growth right now theres not a lot to propel consumers forward</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a rule of thumb the economy needs to grow about 3 a year or more to bring down the unemployment rate said paul edelstein director of financial economics at ihs global insight</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>considering consumer spending is one of the economys biggest components it too would have to grow close to 3 to spur stronger job growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but since the recession ended consumers have picked up their spending about 2 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and as of this spring it looks as if spending has slowed to an even weaker pace</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spending stalled in april and may according to reports from the commerce department</s>
<s>a separate measure on retail sales shows shops reported declining sales for the third consecutive month in june</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of gdp so this is a worrisome sign  albeit not a very surprising one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>three years after the great recession ended americans are still in the mode of paying down debt and putting money into savings rather than spending and investing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>households have been deleveraging since 2008 according to federal reserve data and on average theyre stashing away about 4 of their income in savings each month</s>
<s>meanwhile their earnings remain fairly stagnant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats understandable given the unemployment rate is stuck at 82 and home prices  a big factor in household wealth  are still near nineyear lows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those who went through the great depression were fundamentally changed for their entire lives</s>
<s>they were prone to hoarding said sean snaith director of the university of central floridas institute for economic competitiveness</s>
<s>i think the great recession is going to have similar lasting effects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this collective frugality may be too much of a good thing</s>
<s>less consumer spending means businesses have little incentive to hire and overall growth stagnates as a result</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on an individual basis it makes perfect sense</s>
<s>you want to get your financial house in order bullard said</s>
<s>but when everybody does it at the same time it tends to choke off growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the economy is facing a chickenoregg conundrum</s>
<s>if job growth doesnt pick up consumer spending is unlikely to grow substantially any time soon</s>
<s>on the other hand if consumers dont go out and buy more companies dont have much incentive to hire more workers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unless something else snaps the us economy out of this cycle economic growth could stay around or below 2 for as far as the eye can see bullard said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one hope lies in the housing sector which seems to have recently bottomed out and may start recovering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if home sales pick up that could lead to a pickup in construction jobs and if home prices start rising steadily that could make consumers feel more confident about their own financial situations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but for now the outlook is still pointing to sluggish growth for the foreseeable future</s>
<s>economists predict the economy will grow at only a 21 rate in the third quarterÂ </s>
