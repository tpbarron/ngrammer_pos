<s>spain is the focal point of investor anxiety in europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  spain has come under heavy pressure in the bond market this week as investors grow increasingly convinced that the government will need a bailout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at current levels the price spain must pay to borrow money for 10 years now looks to be comfortably above 7 a cost that experts say the government cannot afford to pay for long</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield on spains 10 year bond rose to a high of 775 on wednesday before falling back to 737 later in the day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pressures are clearly building for a major policy response as spain finds the cost of funding reaching intolerable levels said andrew milligan head of global strategy at standard life investments in edinburgh</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the surge in yields which rise when prices fall reflects a growing conviction among investors that spain will become the latest and largest euro area nation to seek a bailout from the european union and international monetary fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spain has been in the line of fire since it requested up to €100 billion in loans from the eurozone rescue fund to recapitalize the nations banks</s>
<s>eurozone finance ministers approved the terms of the loan agreement last week but the move failed to allay concerns about spain needing a fullblown bailout similar to those given to greece portugal and ireland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spanish prime minister mariano rajoy has resisted taking such a dramatic step which would entail a significant loss of national sovereignty and a lasting stigma</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if madrid capitulated analysts say the eurozone may not have enough money to fund a bailout for spain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bulk of europes crisis resources will be in the european stability mechanism which is on hold until sept 15 when the german constitutional court is expected to issue an initial opinion on its legality</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more analysts say the esm will not be able to inject funds directly into spanish banks until a eurozonewide banking regulator is established which could take months if not years</s>
<s>that means the loans could end up adding to the debts of the spanish government which is already struggling to shrink its deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the meantime eurozone finance ministers have agreed to set aside €30 billion in emergency funds for spain from the european financial stability facility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contrast spain could need up to €300 billion to cover its financing needs through 2015 according to londonbased research firm capital economics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the efsf could theoretically fund a bailout for spain until the esm is up and running said capital economics analyst jonathan loynes in a research note</s>
<s>but that would deplete the resources of both funds and leave little in the pot for other troubled eurozone nations he added</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed investors have been worried that italy could be left out in the cold if spain is forced to take a bailout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield on italys 10year bond shot to a high of 67 on wednesday before falling back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the trend in shortterm yields is even more worrying according to nicholas spiro director of londonbased consultancy spiro sovereign strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a note spiro said yields on spains 2year notes have risen some 85 basis points since last friday while italys 2year yields have jumped nearly 100 basis points in the same time frame</s>
<s>a basis point is equal to one onehundredth of one percentage point</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the failure to shore up spain is wreaking havoc with italys bond market said spiro</s>
<s>fears that spains request for a bailout would make italy more vulnerable are being borne out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the moves in european bond markets this week have raised speculation that the european central bank will intervene on spains behalf</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ecb has purchased billions of euros worth of bonds issued by spain and other euro area governments under the controversial securities market program</s>
<s>the central bank also pumped over €1 trillion worth of liquidity into the european banking system in two separate operations which temporarily eased sovereign borrowing costs earlier this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but some ecb officials have expressed concern that subsidizing government debt would reduce the incentive officials have to enact the reforms deemed necessary to restore fiscal discipline</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition analysts say another intervention by the ecb would only buy time rather than address the underlying problems in the eurozone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to do that euro area leaders need to make a significant move towards a socalled fiscal and political union analysts say</s>
<s>while they have taken steps in that direction the shift could take years to complete given the slow pace of progress so far</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>much will depend on germany the largest economy in the eurozone which has expressed deep reservations about assuming the liabilities of other euro area governments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its very difficult to see what in the shortterm at least could shore up confidence in spain and italy for anything longer than a few weeks or so said spiro</s>
<s>only a gamechanging move on the part of germany could make a difference</s>
<s>for the time being this is highly unlikely</s>
