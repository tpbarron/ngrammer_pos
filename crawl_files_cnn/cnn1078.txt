<s>new york cnnmoney  there is a remarkable trend developing in european bond markets where investors are increasingly willing to lend money to certain governments in exchange for next to nothing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the most extreme example yields on 2year german bonds turned negative this week falling to a record 05</s>
<s>that means in theory at least investors could end up losing money if they hold the bonds to maturity</s>
