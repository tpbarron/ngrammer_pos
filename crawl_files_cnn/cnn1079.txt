<p>
<s>fortune  when gene montesano 63 and barry perlman 57 launched lucky brand blue jeans in 1989 it was almost unheardof to charge $70 for denim pants</s>
<s>but they understood fashion and the zeitgeist</s>
<s>their jeans were designed with an irreverent sense of humor that bucked the politically correct 90s and they appealed to rockandroll stars and the fans who wanted to be like them</s>
<s>in 1999 the founders sold the business to liz claiborne for $125 million</s>
<s>lucky brand remains a moneymaker for claiborne now fifth  pacific fnp with sales of $4182 million in 2011 but montesano and perlman left in 2009</s>
<s>theyre back with a new clothing line of jeans shirts and sweaters called civilianaire</s>
<s>their story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene montesano i got a job at 19 working in a store called the red hanger in north miami beach</s>
<s>back in 1968 jeans sold for $6</s>
<s>id sell $1200 worth of stuff and the manager thought i was a genius</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry perlman a few years later id gotten a job my senior year of high school at that same store and fell in love with the apparel business</s>
<s>the manager billy rudnick and i talked about doing a store ourselves and billy said youve got to meet my friend gene</s>
<s> it was 1973 and my parents were cool with it</s>
<s>when my grandfather died he left me $5000 in ibm ibm fortune 500 and international paper ip fortune 500 stock</s>
<s>we used that money and $5000 that billy had borrowed from a friend to open the store</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene we built the interior ourselves and called it four way street</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry we had no money so we stacked cinder blocks and put particle board between them to put the jeans on</s>
<s>wed hang rope from the ceiling with wood dowels and thats how we did the window displays</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene we sold jeans tshirts and jackets and id be in the back making leather bags</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry we started to buy lines we thought were cool</s>
<s>we bought all mens wear but when all these cool women started walking in we figured we needed to get stuff for them</s>
<s>it was really about being in the store and selling jeans</s>
<s>we never talked about how to make money</s>
<s>we were gut merchants</s>
<s>in 1975 we opened a second store in coconut grove it pulled in $950000 a year</s>
<s>people loved hanging out in our stores</s>
<s>we had long hair and loud music which was a different way of doing things then</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene in 1975 i left the store</s>
<s>when i came back i opened a shoe store inside four way street for 2Â½ years but there wasnt enough profit for three owners</s>
<s>i decided to leave in august 1978</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry when gene made his decision i decided to take a break too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene barry took off for a year then went back to four way street for 10 years</s>
<s>i worked for a couple of jeans companies and by 1982 i was doing production and design for the marciano brothers at guess ges</s>
<s>thats where i learned hard work pays off</s>
<s>i decided i wanted to start a business of my own</s>
<s>michael caruso was a salesman there and had a little money</s>
<s>i didnt have any money but i put a bug in his ear and we started bongo jeans</s>
<s>he kicked in some $50000</s>
<s>i was making $35000 a year at guess which was a fortune to me</s>
<s>but when i left guess i had $18 in a coffee can</s>
<s>it was tough until a couple of years into bongo jeans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry i came back to la in 1988</s>
<s>gene had bongo and i started doing bongo for kids and iggywear a kids clothing line to learn the business of manufacturing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene bongo was a womens junior jean company locked into a price point of $2999</s>
<s>i told michael id like to do something separate</s>
<s>so i decided to make jeans for $60 twice the price of bongo jeans and make them just for men so that it wouldnt conflict with bongo</s>
<s>i just wanted to make the best jeans i could</s>
<s>i figured twice the price would cover better materials</s>
<s>that was the start of lucky brand in 1989</s>
<s>i needed some help and barry came in as my partner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry gene was in chinatown one day where everything was lucky this and lucky that</s>
<s>he called me and said what do you think of the name lucky</s>
<s> everyone else was trying to sound french european</s>
<s>so the name started as lucky</s>
<s>gene added brand to it shortly thereafter</s>
<s>then it became lucky brand jeans</s>
<s>there were times it was lucky jeans</s>
<s>wed have so many different labels on the same jeans and people were buying them</s>
<s>we were always bucking the system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene to me it wasnt hard starting lucky brand</s>
<s>in 1989 bongo was a $60 million business and was supporting me</s>
<s>i started lucky brand with a little over $100000 of my own money</s>
<s>barry had the kids company at the time so id get a cut of 1200 jeans and ship them out of his warehouse</s>
<s>lucky gave me the freedom to design whatever i wanted</s>
<s>with the higher price point i could put four or five woven labels into the jeans instead of one paper one</s>
<s>i could use a wider zipper buy great fabric try new rivets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry in 1990 lucky jeans retailed for almost $70 the top price then</s>
<s>rock artists would wear our products and we would hang their photos in the stores</s>
<s>we were known for our twiceayear parties at the trade shows in vegas</s>
<s>when bob dylan played for us in the mid90s we knew we were a success</s>
<s>artists like jackson browne who wouldnt normally play trade shows loved our brand</s>
<s>they wore our stuff and would perform for us because lucky was rock and roll</s>
<s>the first full year we did $35 million and the company made a 30 profit</s>
<s>our second year we did $10 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene michael and i ran bongo together until i left around 1992 or 1993 to concentrate on lucky brand</s>
<s>we sold bongo in 1998 to candies for $15 million in stock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry lucky just grew and grew</s>
<s>we were doing about $60 million in volume and thought maybe we needed some help to expand</s>
<s>we had eight stores and the bulk of the volume was wholesale</s>
<s>in 1999 we did the deal with liz claiborne</s>
<s>they talked about helping us manufacture around the world and expand in retail</s>
<s>it was a way for us to secure what wed started and grow it</s>
<s>they bought 85 of the company for $125 million and we were under contract for five years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene it was seductive</s>
<s>for the first years it was pretty cool</s>
<s>five years into it things got squirrelly</s>
<s>corporate america is about making the quarter</s>
<s>we left liz claiborne with no noncompete clause</s>
<s>they said we could have another company but the jeans would have to be a different price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry we bought this building a mile from the lucky office and started the next day thinking about what we wanted to do next</s>
<s>you gravitate to what you love</s>
<s>so in 2010 we started civilianaire an array of sportswear thats made of the best material we can find</s>
<s>the first store opened in la in february 2011</s>
<s>we have five now and will open three more soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene everythings made in los angeles and the prices range from $210 to $235 for the jeans</s>
<s>shirts are under $200</s>
<s>our jeans are raw and unwashed made of the finest japanese denim you can get</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barry were not doing any advertising just concentrating on the product</s>
<s>the revenue is small so far but people are coming in and reordering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gene were doing it out of our own pockets</s>
<s>we just love jeans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>balance work and play</s>
<s>life is full of ups and downs so weave work and play together at the office because its got to be about having a good time</s>
<s>as hard as the job was bongo and lucky had a culture of being a little irreverent and fun</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your customers are your best salespeople</s>
<s>a story broke on cnn about a girl in indiana whose car got hit by a train</s>
<s>she attributed her life to her faith in jesus and wearing a lucky brand tshirt</s>
<s>we flew her to la put her on jay leno and gave her a shopping spree</s>
<s>the whole thing of wearing lucky brand too tough to die grew</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont stop when youre a success</s>
<s>make your product better</s>
<s>keep taking risks</s>
<s>you can either have a job or you can build something</s>
</p>
