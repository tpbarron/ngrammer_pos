<s>my husband and i get clobbered on taxes because we have a rental house in another state that we cant sell and because of it we cant buy a house in the state we live in</s>
<s>we make too much $195000 before deductions so the rental mortgage interest is unavailable to use as a deduction</s>
<s>is it worth it to start a small business at home to try to make some deductions appear</s>
<s>my husband refinished a boat last year that we kept but he wants to refinish another one or two and then sell them</s>
<s>i on the other hand sew and quilt and would like to start an etsy business</s>

<s>the problem with your plan is this in order to decrease your overall tax bill youd have to take a loss on your business</s>
<s>otherwise youre just applying business expenses against your business income which means youll still pay taxes on any profit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres an extremely simplistic example if you make $1000 on your etsy business and incur $600 in expenses youll still be paying taxes on the $400 in profits</s>
<s>and if you make $1000 on your etsy business and incur $1500 in expenses youll pay less in taxes — but only because you lost money overall</s>
<s>to lose money for the sake of shrinking your tax bill doesnt make any sense at all says andrew schwartz a cpa in woburn mass</s>
<s>if somebody loses a dollar the most theyre going to recoup in federal income taxes is 35 cents</s>
<s>youre better off not losing the dollar</s>

<p>
<s>thats assuming that your husbands boat refinishing business and your etsy business are in fact businesses and not hobbies</s>
<s>the irs isnt wild about people taking business deductions for activities that are actually hobbies and has some guidelines on the subject</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you are however refinishing boats and making quilts on a profitseeking basis you should absolutely be taking the deductions that are available to you including a home office deduction if its applicable</s>
<s>if your husband is running a boat refinishing business and hes doing that out of the house then some of the rent that youre paying will be deductible against the profit youre seeing says howard samuels a cpa in new york city</s>
<s>but youre only allowed to deduct a home office if it doesnt make your profits negative</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you go down this road you should probably consult with a cpa at least in the first year so you understand what is and isnt possible</s>
<s>if you get audited the government is going to say prove youre running a real business samuels says</s>
<s>where is your website</s>
<s>where are your business cards</s>
<s> youre going to have to show that its legit</s>
