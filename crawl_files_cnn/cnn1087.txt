<s>new york money  im just starting out in my career and im trying to decide how to divide my contributions between my companys regular 401k plan and its roth 401k</s>
<s>ive heard that im better off putting money into the roth because im probably in the lowest tax bracket ill ever be in</s>
<s>if i contribute 10 of my pay should i just put 5 in each</s>
<s>or should i put it all in the roth 401k and switch to a regular 401k later in my career as my tax burden rises</s>

<p>
<s>in theory as a young person you are likely to pay the lowest tax rates early on in your career when your income is probably smallest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on balance that argues for contributing to a roth 401k and paying the tax on the contribution now at a low tax rate and sidestepping a higher rate later on rather than contributing to a regular 401k and paying a higher rate down the road</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but arbitraging tax rates isnt always so neat and clean in the real world</s>
<s>your income might not grow as much as you think</s>
<s>and tax rates can and do change frequently</s>
<s>so its hard to predict where they might be decades from now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what really counts in the traditionalversusroth 401k calculation is the difference between the tax rate you face at the time you contribute to your 401k and the rate you pay when you withdraw the money in retirement</s>
<s>or more accurately rates you may pay as you might not face the same rate every year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not just a matter of the tax brackets that prevail when you are retired but also the size of your retirement income</s>
<s>keep in mind that even if the brackets have gone up you could still face the same or even lower tax rate if your income has fallen off enough after you retire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so while i think it makes sense for you to favor the roth 401k i wouldnt fund the roth exclusively</s>
<s>id also put some dough into the traditional 401k too  if for no other reason than to hedge my bets about future tax rates</s>

<p>
<s>i cant give you a formula or rule of thumb for divvying up your 401k contribution</s>
<s>its really more a matter of how confident you feel about your likely tax situation in retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre on the fence  with no strong opinion either way  then you might try to keep roughly equal amounts in both accounts</s>
<s>however the more you feel that one way or another youll be facing higher tax rates when you begin drawing money from your retirement accounts the more you should lean toward the roth 401k</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example if youre really convinced youll be hit with a higher tax rate then you could shoot for a ratio like 70 roth 401k and 30 traditional</s>
<s>if on the other hand you think the opposite is more likely to be true  that is youll end up in a lower tax bracket  then you might reverse the percentages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these arent carvedinstone rules</s>
<s>theyre just rough guidelines that you can adjust based on your own preferences</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are also a few other things youll want to consider</s>
<s>the more you favor the roth the less of your income will be sheltered from taxes today and thus the higher your current tax bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this calculator can show you the effect different levels of contributions to traditional and roth 401ks will have on your tax tab and takehome pay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also remember that contributing to a traditional 401k lowers your adjusted gross income</s>
<s>so to the extent you contribute to a roth 401k instead your adjusted gross income will be higher which may affect your ability to take deductions pegged to adjusted gross income such as medical and miscellaneous expenses</s>
<s>it may even determine whether you can do a traditional or roth ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and dont forget that if your employer matches any part of your 401k contribution then even if you contribute solely to the roth 401k you will still end up with money in the traditional</s>
<s>thats because employers are required to put all matching funds in a traditional 401k</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so say you earn $40000 and contribute 10 of your salary or $4000 and divide it equally between your traditional and roth 401k and your employer matches 50 of that amount or $2000</s>
<s>over the course of a year you would actually end up with $2000 going into the roth while your traditional ira would get double that amount or $4000 your $2000 plus your employers $2000 match</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>be sure to take any employer match like this into account when divvying up your contribution</s>
<s>dont get too obsessed about this though as theres no way to accurately predict the tax rate youll face in just a few years  let alone 30 or more years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>besides you can always make adjustments later on by contributing more to one account or another or assuming you qualify contributing to a traditional or roth ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you also have the option of converting dollars in a regular ira or 401k to a roth ira and possibly do an inplan rollover from a traditional 401k to a roth 401k</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the end of the day your retirement security will depend more on whether you consistently sock away that 10 of your salary year after year throughout your career than how you divvy it up between traditional and roth accountsÂ </s>
