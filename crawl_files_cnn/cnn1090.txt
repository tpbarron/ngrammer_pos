<s>i graduated in may with a masters degree but i am currently unable to find full time work in my field</s>
<s>soon i will be on the hook for my first student loan payment of $628 a month and i will have 10 years of payments</s>
<s>because i am only working part time i will not be able to cover that payment along with my other living expenses</s>
<s>should i cash out my 401k from a former job</s>
<s>it is worth about $46000 right now and that would almost cover all of my student loans</s>

<s>while its tempting to consider using retirement funds to pay off student loan debt there are huge drawbacks warns mark kantrowitz founder of finaidorg</s>
<s>for one you wont have that money and the substantial earnings that may accumulate when you retire</s>
<s>instead youll have to start your retirement savings from scratch again</s>
<s>whats more youll be subject to a 10 penalty assuming youre not yet 59 ½ and income taxes on the 401k withdrawal</s>

<s>there are better other options besides</s>
<s>if you have federal loans—such as an unsubsidized stafford loan or grad plus loan—take a look at the extended repayment option which could cut your monthly payment by more than $200 by increasing the loan term to 25 years says kantrowitz</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or consider the incomebased repayment which would base your monthly payment on a percentage of your discretionary income</s>
<s>this may result in an even lower payment while you are underemployed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is also something called the economic hardship deferment that suspends your repayment obligation temporarily though the interest will continue to build during the hiatus</s>
<s>if you think youll get a fulltime job soon this option may work for you</s>
<s>kantrowitz recommends that people who opt for a deferment continue to pay the interest on the loans during the suspension period to keep the balance from growing</s>
