<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  spain has asked the european union for up to €100 billion $125 billion to provide a capital buffer for the nations ailing banks the eurogroup said saturday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the eurogroup has been informed that the spanish authorities will present a formal request shortly and is willing to respond favorably to such a request the group said in a statement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>without specifying the amount sought spains economy minister luis de guindos announced the request at a news conference in madrid</s>
<s>de guindos said that the amount sought would be enough to guarantee the safety of the banks and signify credibility to the capital markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the announcement came in the wake of an international monetary fund report issued late friday saying that several banks in spain would need to raise capital buffers by a total of €40 billion $501 billion to withstand another financial shock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eu officials are eager to resolve the issue before a pivotal election in greece on june 17 which could present another major turning point in the longrunning european debt crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many details remain to be finalized de guindos said in saturdays news conference</s>
<s>he said much will depend on the outcome of two independent audits of spanish banks that are expected to be done later this month</s>
<s>the eurogroup said in its statement that its aid would be scaled according to the results of the audit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the money will be loaned to spains bailout fund which will then inject it into banks that need to raise capital according to de guindos</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the loan will be provided on very favorable terms he said adding that the conditions will only apply to banks and not the government</s>
<s>he stressed that spain has asked for help with its banks and that it has not requested a fullblown bailout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the european financial stability facility could provide some of the capital said de guindos</s>
<s>but he added that the bailout fund has not been authorized by all euro area parliaments to grant such a request</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the efsf has already backed loans for greece ireland and portugal</s>
<s>it has about €200 billion in available funds according to some estimates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the goal is to help the spanish economy recover by recapitalizing insolvent banks so that those institutions can begin lending to companies and families said de guindos</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we believe this announcement is good news for the spanish economy and good news for the eurozone said de guindos</s>
<s>it shows the political willingness of the eu to eliminate the doubts that exist now about the euro</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the obama administration hoping to keep the european crisis from fouling the us economy in an election year reacted positively to the announcement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we welcome spains action to recapitalize its banking system and the commitment by its european partners to provide support treasury secretary tim geithner said in a statement</s>
<s>these are important for the health of spains economy and as concrete steps on the path to financial union which is vital to the resilience of the euro area</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the imf said it subjected spanish banks to a stress test and found that most large banks are relatively healthy</s>
<s>but the group warned that several banks would need to raise buffers under the worstcase scenario</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the €40 billion figure is not a definitive estimate of the banks capital needs</s>
<s>the imf said banks would need to raise more capital depending on restructuring costs and loan adjustments that have yet to take place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>going forward it will be critical to communicate clearly the strategy for providing a credible backstop for capital shortfalls  a backstop that experience shows it is better to overestimate than underestimate said ceyla pazarbasioglu deputy director of the imfs monetary and capital markets department</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fitch ratings agency which slashed spains credit rating thursday estimated that recapitalizing the spanish banking sector could cost up to €100 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the report was released as imf managing director christine lagarde called on global policy makers to come together for the sake of the global economy and get the job done</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is no mistaking that global risks are on the rise again she said in a friday speech in new york</s>
<s>the euro area crisis continues to be the most immediate and most pressing threat and there is the risk that conditions could get worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while the euro crisis is the most immediate concern she also warned that the us economy could fall of a fiscal cliff if the nations debt is not put on a sustainable path</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>european banks are at the epicenter of our current worries and naturally should be the priority for repair she said</s>
<s>but this does not mean we should overlook the broader implications of todays interconnected world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lagarde pointed to the recent disclosure by jpmorgan chase jpm fortune 500 that the largest us bank by assets had lost at lest $2 billion on risky trades</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are still many questions surrounding jpmorgans trading loss</s>
<s>yet they should be seen as a warning shot over the bow she said</s>
<s>it reveals that too much risk remains</s>
