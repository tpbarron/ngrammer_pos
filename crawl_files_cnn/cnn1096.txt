<p>
<s>fortune  at one time steve leveen and his wife lori granger leveen used to clash in a friendly way over who got to use their one good reading lamp</s>
<s>must be a lot of people out there fighting over the same thing  right</s>
<s>must be serious readers who could use serious reading supplies  right</s>
<s>so they launched levenger a catalogue featuring fashionable reading and writing accessories in 1987</s>
<s>twentyfive years later steve and lori now 57 and 55 respectively are struggling a bit as reading goes high tech</s>
<s>but their annual sales are an estimated $184 million according to hoovers and theyre hopeful they can convince younger readers and writers that theres value in lowtech products</s>
<s>heres how they got going  and how theyre trying to reinvent their delray beach fla company</s>
<s>edited excerpts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori leveen i studied history at vassar and after graduation in 1979 i decided to move to new york city with some girlfriends and got a job as a medicalmalpractice underwriter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve leveen i moved to new york after finishing a masters in sociology at cornell and worked as a journalist</s>
<s>lori and i moved to the city two weeks apart and worked in a building two floors apart</s>
<s>we met on a subway  the no</s>
<s>1 broadway local</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori we moved to washington dc where i got my masters in international business diplomacy then to boston</s>
<s>it was 1985 and i became a marketing rep for ibm ibm fortune 500</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve i was in charge of newbusiness development for a software company</s>
<s>i made a cocky statement to the president that a certain product should get approved by the board or i should move on</s>
<s>the board didnt approve the product and i was fired</s>
<s>in retrospect that was what i needed to launch out on my own</s>
<s>in 1987 lori was pregnant with our first son but we decided the time was right to start our own company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori we thought if things didnt work out i could always go back to ibm</s>
<s>were both avid readers and i noticed that in many homes there was no great place to sit and read</s>
<s>i had an oldfashioned lamp and steve and i would fight over who got to sit under it to read</s>
<s>so we went around to stores to research reading lights and decided to assemble a collection to sell to readers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve i had some severance and did some graphics work</s>
<s>i sold my 1986 mitsubishi montero for $8000 then cashed in an ira for $12000</s>
<s>my father kept us in groceries for two years before we took a salary</s>
<s>he gave us his old cadillac to his dismay i promptly sold it and put the $12000 into the business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori our first catalogue was one piece of paper folded twice</s>
<s>we put together some ads and put them in the new york times and the boston globe but didnt get much response</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve we thought we might have to give up and go find jobs but as a lastditch effort we put an ad in the new yorker saying serious lighting for serious readers and people started calling</s>
<s>the ad ran oct 12 1987 which was my birthday and by christmastime we had 47 customers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori i remember getting our first check in the mail</s>
<s>steve was so excited he got on the floor and spun around</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve we started with halogen lights</s>
<s>our first successful product was sold as a computer lamp but people wanted it for reading in bed without disturbing their spouses so we repositioned it as a reading lamp</s>
<s>we did almost everything out of our home</s>
<s>a neighbor rented us his garage where we held inventory</s>
<s>id have the baby monitor in the garage up the hill</s>
<s>lori would give me instructions and i couldnt talk back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve we decided to take care of the customers and eat the cost</s>
<s>we lost a lot of money but would not lose customers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori you can either take things as a challenge or crawl away and we put on our boxing gloves</s>
<s>we soon expanded beyond lighting because we got calls from bookstores that said their customers were looking for a dictionary stand or bookcase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve when the neighbors started to complain about the ups deliveries coming every day we knew it was time to find office space</s>
<s>my dad was in florida and i was ready for a warmer climate</s>
<s>so in 1989 we moved south renting a warehouse in delray beach that had a retail store in front</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori it was 1990 before we turned a profit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve a lot of that was due to ric leichtung a retired mailorder merchant who came by our store one day</s>
<s>he taught us about details we knew nothing about  pricing the importance of gross margin copy writing</s>
<s>with his help we did our first color catalogue got a list broker and spent our first real investment of $25000 sending catalogues to 50000 names</s>
<s>within a few cycles we were making money while acquiring customers</s>
<s>our sales doubled for several years to $24 million in the mid1990s enough to buy the land warehouse and our headquarters</s>
<s>hard times came at the end of the 1990s</s>
<s>we made the mistake of hiring more people to do the fulfillment at the warehouse without looking at how to be more efficient</s>
<s>so we had to lay off people</s>
<s>when we moved to the internet in 1996 it cost a lot to create a good website but sales came mostly from existing customers who ordered online rather than pick up the phone</s>
<s>so we still had to mail the catalogues</s>
<s>the internet has increased the complexities and cost of the business but has not delivered as much incremental revenue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori theres been a huge change in reading</s>
<s>people are going between the electronics and books</s>
<s>but they still want a light for reading and something to prop up their book or ipad</s>
<s>were still relevant to people as they make the transition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve we have the opportunity to invent the future for pens and paper notebooks</s>
<s>candles were made obsolete by the light bulb years ago but we all have candles in our homes because we like them</s>
<s>we need to do that with paper pen leather goods and wood</s>
<s>babies are growing up with ipads</s>
<s>if we dont get it right in the next 10 years we may miss the opportunity</s>
<s>like everyone else were recovering from this recession</s>
<s>we had five retail stores and took it down to three</s>
<s>we reduced our catalogue circulation cutting mailings to existing customers and prospects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lori we moved our warehouse to memphis to be closer to distribution points and didnt need the space here</s>
<s>so we sold our office building three years ago and used the proceeds to help fund the business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steve from the start we wanted to do something significant</s>
<s>were not saving the world but the people buying from us are  the scientists doctors attorneys people whose work can change the world</s>
<s>were honored to make stuff for them especially in this digital age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just start</s>
<s>you can study something to death</s>
<s>get started and learn from your customers</s>
<s>at some point if your gut says youre ready youve got to take the leap</s>
<s>the more mature a business becomes the more important business plans become but write them at the right time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont solve all the problems yourself</s>
<s>if you continue to be the one solving the problems your business will never grow beyond you</s>
<s>your colleagues need the opportunity to grow</s>
<s>they need to be accountable for their decisions make mistakes have their own successes and have the chance to enjoy the fun of business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>practice conscious capitalism</s>
<s>you can have a broader view of stakeholders  beyond shareholders  and a company can do well by doing good</s>
<s>our partnering for good program sources products in developing countries and gives money back to the villages to support libraries and reading programs</s>
<s>its a competitive advantage to think broader and act broader</s>
