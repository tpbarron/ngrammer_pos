<s>european central bank president mario draghi is under pressure to act</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  european central bank president mario draghi said thursday that the ecb will not intervene in the government debt market unless countries take certain actions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi said the ecb could buy spanish and italian bonds but only if those governments make good on commitments to reduce deficits and restore economic competitiveness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in simple terms that means spain and italy need to first commit to a formal bailout program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>governments must go to the efsf first said draghi referring to european financial stability facility which has backed bailouts for greece portugal and ireland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however draghi also said that the ecb may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective if all the conditions are met adding that the terms for such an intervention would be developed in the coming weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi said the new framework differs from the ecbs existing bond buying program known as the securities market program</s>
<s>we have explicit conditionality here he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there will be full transparency about the countries involved and the size of the bond purchases said draghi adding that the ecb would focus on buying shortterm bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi stressed that intervening in the bond market is not a violation of the central banks prohibition on financing governments</s>
<s>this falls squarely in our mandate he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the decision was endorsed by all members of the ecbs governing council with one exception</s>
<s>draghi did not specify which member was opposed but he acknowledged that some central bankers including bundesbank president jens weidmann have their reservations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi said there was no specific development that prompted the decision to move towards more nonstandard measures</s>
<s>the central bank was acting in response to a sense of worsening of the crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while he said the governing council had discussed other measures draghi dismissed questions about what those could include</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi shot down one widely discussed proposal to give a banking license to the european stability mechanism a bailout fund that has yet to be fully established</s>
<s>in theory this would allow the esm to borrow money from the ecb giving it a potentially unlimited source of funding to buy bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi had said the esm as it is currently designed is not a suitable counterparty for the ecb</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the remarks disappointed global financial markets where investors had been hoping for a more explicit bond buying commitment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stocks in london frankfurt and paris fell between 05 and 15</s>
<s>us stocks opened lower as investors gravitated away from risky assets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield on spanish 10year bonds rose back above 7 a level widely considered unsustainable</s>
<s>italian 10year yields rose to 62 up from 59 on wednesday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors have been worried about spain being forced to seek a full blown bailout if the effort to rescue the nations banking sector falls short</s>
<s>that would strain the eurozones crisis resources and leave italy exposed to a deeper crisis in the bond market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile the ecb left its main refinancing rate unchanged at 075 after cutting the rate to an alltime low at its last meeting</s>
<s>the deposit rate which is what the ecb pays banks on excess reserves was also unchanged at zero percent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ecb meeting comes one day after the federal reserve left its policies unchanged disappointing investors who had hoped the us central bank would do more</s>
