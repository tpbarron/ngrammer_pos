<s>jeff fluhr was looking for businesses that were ripe for change</s>
<s> scalpers were just the ticket to start stubhub</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fortune  making money through technology is jeff fluhrs stockintrade</s>
<s>fluhr 38 was the cofounder of san franciscos stubhubcom an online ticket marketplace where fans buy and sell from each other</s>
<s>fluhr sold it to ebay in 2007 for $310 million</s>
<s>now hes trying for an encore with the launch of spreecastcom a social video platform designed to bring the intimacy of facetoface conversations online</s>
<s>heres his story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my father zachary was an electrical engineer for att t fortune 500 and my mother laura worked at a womens designerconsignment shop in manhattan owned by her dad michael kosof</s>
<s>she later took over the store</s>
<s>when my dad retired he started a commercial real estate security business so theres entrepreneurship in my family blood</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after i graduated from the university of pennsylvania in 1996 my first job was at the blackstone group bx a large financial services firm in new york</s>
<s>i decided that going into investment banking would be a great way to learn how to evaluate companies</s>
<s>blackstone dealt with oldschool manufacturing businesses which were good for leveraged buyouts but it wasnt interesting to me</s>
<s>i was an analyst and learned a lot but decided to look for something that was more in the technology world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the late 1990s the internet was coming into its own</s>
<s>netscape yahoo yhoo fortune 500 and ebay ebay fortune 500 started and i decided to move to san francisco to work for thomas weisel partners a private equity firm that worked with tech companies</s>
<s>after a while with my interest in business and technology i decided to start a company of my own</s>
<s>i thought going to business school would be a great way to pivot network with people and have time to develop a business plan for a startup</s>
<s>so in 1999 i enrolled in stanfords graduate school of business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i wasnt sure what i wanted to do but i met eric baker another student whod also worked at financial institutions</s>
<s>we talked about our mutual interest in starting a company and different ideas about industries that were ripe for change</s>
<s>erics dad was a season ticket holder for the lakers and my dad for the yankees</s>
<s>we talked about the large quantity of tickets for sporting events theater events and concerts that werent used and the fragmented market of ticket brokers who resold those tickets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was a stigmatized business with the perception that youd get scammed if you bought a ticket from a scalper</s>
<s>but we thought there might be an opportunity for buying and selling tickets online</s>
<s>i wrote the idea up as a business plan for stanfords business plan competition and we were chosen as one of the six finalists</s>
<s>but we pulled out because we decided to start the company and didnt want competition before we got going</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we started networking talked to executives in the music and sports industries and found investors</s>
<s>by august 2000 we had raised $600000 of seed capital for stubhub</s>
<s>it would be an ebay for tickets</s>
<s>sellers would set the price more or less than a tickets face value depending on market demand</s>
<s>wed take a percentage on every transaction  10 from the buyer and 15 from the seller</s>
<s>that first $600000 was enough to get us to our beta product get into the market and learn and test different features</s>
<s>the seed money came from family and friends but the next level was more difficult</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we had incorporated in march 2000 and right after that the dotcom bubble burst</s>
<s>as we went to raise our second round of funding a lot of people said no</s>
<s>so we had to meet with more than 50 angel investors venture capital firms and others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eric stayed at stanford to get his degree but i left to become ceo and run the company</s>
<s>when he graduated in 2001 he joined as president</s>
<s>we had about 20 to 30 employees our second year 60 people the next</s>
<s>by the time we sold to ebay in 2007 there were 350 to 400 employees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2004 eric and i had a difference in vision</s>
<s>he wanted to focus on partnerships with leagues using their brands to build our brand</s>
<s>i felt we should concentrate on building our own brand so both of us decided to part ways</s>
<s>he kept his share as cofounder and left the company</s>
<s>we got to cash flow positive in 2005 and revenue was about $50 million</s>
<s>we became a hot company growing rapidly but there were still challenges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ten or 15 states had laws that restricted the amount you could charge to resell a ticket either citing a fixed dollar amount over face value or a cap on the percentage over face value</s>
<s>we got letters from a few state attorneys general implying that we might not be in compliance</s>
<s>we argued that we werent the sellers of the tickets the users were</s>
<s>no attorney general ever filed a claim against the company</s>
<s>we actually hired some lobbyists and were successful in changing the laws in states like new york florida and pennsylvania</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another challenge was ticketmaster which didnt like us or our business model</s>
<s>they said we were infringing on their contracts with venues or performing artists by reselling tickets</s>
<s>they never took legal action during my time but sent letters of complaint</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the one significant lawsuit we faced was with the new england patriots which filed suit when we were in discussions to sell to ebay in 2006</s>
<s>they said we were inducing their season ticket holders to violate their agreement with the team</s>
<s>we sold before the suit was decided and ebay settled with them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2006 the company was profitable with $100 million in revenue</s>
<s>when ebay approached us i had gotten to the point where i wanted to move on to the next thing</s>
<s>i had gotten married in 2005 while stubhub was rising and my wife was pregnant</s>
<s>so we sold stubhub for $310 million in 2007 and closed the transaction two weeks before my first son was born</s>
<s>i took time off to travel with my family and we went around the world</s>
<s>i played a lot of golf and tennis started doing angel investing and just enjoyed myself</s>
<s>im invested in 40 different companies now</s>
<s>some are doing well and some not</s>
<s>i stopped doing angel investing in 2010 and started spreecastcom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the last 10 years i noticed that with facebook fb and twitter and smartphones people are spending a lot of time to stay connected</s>
<s>but theres something missing with the way were communicating now with all this textbased asynchronous communication</s>
<s>i wanted to bring back facetoface interaction to the conversation so i started spreecast</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spreecast is a social video platform where you can talk in a public forum about the same topics people are talking about on facebook  whether its the passing of dick clark or fashion  only its in real time using a webcam and web browser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2011 we raised $4 million startup capital from people who invested in stubhub</s>
<s>that figure includes my own investment</s>
<s>the public beta launched in november 2011 and were starting to see celebrities politicians journalists and others who have a public persona experimenting with us to engage with their fans and followers</s>
<s>theres been nice growth month over month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i enjoy the intellectual challenge of building something from nothing and navigating through the challenges of starting a company</s>
<s>i think entrepreneurs look at opportunities and seize them</s>
<s>they dont just talk about them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>challenge the status quo</s>
<s>if youre disrupting the way businesses do things youll be told thats not how it works</s>
<s>but listen to your instincts</s>
<s>spreecast wants to create a throwback to thousands of years before the internet when people had facetoface interactions</s>
<s>without facetoface conversations people are missing out on learning social skills</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>create a team that will mesh well</s>
<s>the mistakes i made in hiring at stubhub have helped inform my decisions this time around</s>
<s>ill be treading more carefully in bringing in senior people and look for different qualities</s>
<s>ill focus less on experience and skill set and be more interested in personality raw intelligence and drive to make the person a better fit with the existing team</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>encourage your team to speak freely</s>
<s>when youre leading a company if you work with people you trust letting them speak their mind allows you to get good ideas on the table even if they conflict with yours</s>
