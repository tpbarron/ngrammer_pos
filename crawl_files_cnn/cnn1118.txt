<s>question im 66 and have major stock losses in my investment accounts</s>
<s>can i use those losses to reduce what ill owe in income taxes</s>
<s>â€”ben g roanoke texas</s>

<p>
<s>answer unless the stock market does an abrupt aboutface and claws its way back into positive territory in the next two months a lot of people like bennie here are going to be sitting on some pretty nasty losses for the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well theres little you can personally do to change the markets direction</s>
<s>even big shots like treasury secretary hank bazooka paulson and federal reserve chairman ben helicopter bernanke havent been able to manage that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but you may be able to take a bit of the pain out of falling stock prices by harvesting some investment losses in your taxable accounts and trimming your tax bill in the process</s>
<s>if you want those losses to trim your taxes for 2008 however youve got to take them by the end of the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the process of booking tax losses is fairly straightforward but as is usually the case with taxes there are a couple of little twists you need to be aware of</s>
<s>heres the drill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>offsetting gains</s>
<s>if you own shares of stock or mutual funds that are now trading for less than you paid for them you can sell those shares to establish a loss</s>
<s>you would then use this loss to offset any realized capital gains that you have on stock or fund shares in effect erasing the tax you would otherwise owe on those gains</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gains</s>
<s>what gains</s>
<s>i can imagine you saying</s>
<s>well the gains could be shares of stocks or funds you sold for a profit earlier this year before the market really plummeted or for that matter shares that you bought long enough ago so that you were still able to unload them for more than you paid despite the markets dive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you own funds remember even if the fund posts a loss for the year it could still have net realized capital gains from securities it sold for a profit at some point during the year</s>
<s>since funds are required by law to distribute net realized capital gains to shareholders each year you could end up with a taxable capital gain even if your fund has a loss  and even if you havent sold shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if your fund distributes shortterm capital gains those gains are considered ordinary income for tax purposes</s>
<s>you wouldnt offset a funds shortterm capital against your capital losses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if your fund distributes longterm capital gains you would apply capital losses from other securities against the funds longterm capitalgains distributions just as you would against capital gains stemming from sales of stock or fund shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>deducting a loss</s>
<s>if the loss you have from selling stock or fund shares exceeds the amount of capital gains you have  or if you dont have any capital gains at all  you can apply up to $3000 of your capital loss against ordinary income</s>
<s>that would include wages interest from cds and the like dividends and even taxable social security benefits and pension income including taxable withdrawals from iras and 401ks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you still have losses left over after doing this you can carry them forward to later years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shortterm vs longterm losses</s>
<s>ive simplified this process a bit</s>
<s>actually the tax code requires that you pair shortterm losses with shortterm gains that is gains or losses on securities youve held a year or less and longterm losses with longterm gains gains or losses you have on securities youve held more than a year in order to arrive at a net capital gain or loss</s>
<s>for details on how to do that you can check out irs publication 550</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no double dipping</s>
<s>while youre perusing this fascinating publication youll also want to check out the section on washsale rules to assure you dont violate them</s>
<s>basically if you buy the same security or a substantially identical one 30 days before or after the sale you made to establish a loss the irs will disallow all or part of that loss</s>
<s>so be careful</s>
<s>you dont want to go to the trouble of taking a loss only to screw up the deduction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stock swap</s>
<s>ah but what if you would like to take a tax loss but you still think the fund or stock has good potential</s>
<s>or what if you would like to take advantage of the market slump but you dont want the screw up the mix of assets in your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in that case you can do a tax swap sell a stock or fund and quickly replace it with one thats similar</s>
<s>just make sure you dont immediately buy the same stock or fund or even one thats substantially identical  say replacing vanguards sp 500 index fund with fidelitys sp 500 index fund  lest you run afoul of the washsale rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but youve still got plenty of maneuvering room around this restriction</s>
<s>if you sell shares of say an sp 500 index fund you could always buy shares of a total stock market index fund</s>
<s>or if youre selling an actively managed fund check out the funds category investing strategy and riskreturn profile at morningstarcom and then look for a fund in the same category with a similar strategy and profile</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its harder to find a close match with stocks but you can likely find a decent fit by looking for a company of roughly the same size in the same industry or you can buy a sector fund or etf that tracks the same industry</s>
<s>once youre beyond the 30day washsale threshold you can then buy back shares of your original stock or fund if you wish</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so between now and the end of the year take a look at your portfolio to see if you might be able to turn some losses to your tax advantage</s>
<s>granted a tax writeoff isnt as nice as a gain</s>
<s>but these days you take what you can get</s>
