<s>new york cnnmoney  since the recession small businesses trying to get bank loans have faced tougher credit standards  and little has changed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the federal reserves most recent survey of bank loan officers released monday 95 said credit standards remained basically unchanged during the second quarter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>less than 5 reported easing standards</s>
<s>although that number is higher than in the previous two quarters it still pales in comparison to the share of banks that reported tightening standards during the recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however the survey of 61 large domestic banks doesnt address a greater economic indicator demand for small business loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>community bankers and industry experts say small firms are avoiding debt because they see little reason to do so</s>
<s>consumer demand remains weak said rohit arora ceo of small firm loan marketplace biz2credit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what the federal reserve survey does reveal though is that those who are looking for credit arent finding it any easier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason cited by community banks is that they are now required to hold on to more funds restricting their ability to make loans as easily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paul merski chief economist of the independent community bankers of america said bankers are wary of loosening standards in what he called such a restrictive regulatory environment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the higher capital requirements proposed in basel iii an international agreement that could soon affect the us banking industry are also having a chilling effect merski said</s>
<s>banks are holding back now to prepare for the higher required reserves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its very difficult to raise fresh capital so you have to start to build up that capital now merski said</s>
<s>one way you build it up is to hold more back</s>
