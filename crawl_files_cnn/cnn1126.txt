<s>and then theres his hardscrabble life</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>as the cliché goes dejoria has come a long way</s>
<s>he wont reveal many financial details but says his worth is more than $4 billion</s>
<s>how did dejoria do it</s>
<s>here are edited excerpts of his story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i grew up in echo park calif which was european asian and hispanic</s>
<s>we didnt know we didnt have anything because we had nothing else to judge things by</s>
<s>my parents divorced when i was 2 and my first job was selling christmas cards doortodoor when i was 9</s>
<s>when i was 11 i was delivering the los angeles examiner before school</s>
<s>i graduated high school at 17 and went into the navy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when i got out of the service in 1964 i didnt have the money to go to college so i worked as a salesman for colliers encyclopedia</s>
<s>i had 10 jobs for the next several years until john capra a friend who was an employment counselor said i should try the beauty industry</s>
<s>he said it didnt pay much at first but there was no end to where you could go with it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so in 1971 i became a redken representative selling hair care products</s>
<s>i started with a $600amonth salary and a $125amonth car allowance</s>
<s>after a year and a half i was running two divisions  scientific schools and chain salons  with two secretaries and four people</s>
<s>doing so much with so few people made the regional managers look bad</s>
<s>plus i didnt play the socializing game with them</s>
<s>they said i wasnt their type of manager and fired me in 1975</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next i went to work for fermodyl hair care which hired me to train their management and sales force on how to sell</s>
<s>sales went up 50 over the year i was there but they said i didnt fit in</s>
<s>i never missed business events but i didnt hang out with them socially</s>
<s>i started selling for another hair care company the institute of trichology where i got $3000 a month plus 6 of all new business that i brought in</s>
<s>after a year there they fired me because they said i made more money than the owner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when people fire you for not being their kind of manager it makes you want to be your own manager</s>
<s>i think being fired was meant to be though because i learned something about sales manufacturing and marketing from each of those companies which helped me start john paul mitchell systems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more the 12 greatest entrepreneurs of our time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1980 my friend paul mitchell was struggling so i said why dont we start a business together</s>
<s> we were both in the hair care business and decided to create products for professional stylists that would cut the time needed to do a clients hair</s>
<s>the first products we created were a singleapplication shampoo where other shampoos at the time were multiapplication and a leavein conditioner that improved blowdry results</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paul would own 30 of the company id own 30 and a european investor contributing $500000 would then own 40</s>
<s>but the investor changed his mind and the money wasnt there</s>
<s>paul was on his last leg</s>
<s>things werent going well with my former wife so i gave her all the money and moved out</s>
<s>i was too proud to tell my friends that i only had a few hundred dollars</s>
<s>so i lived in my car in los angeles for a while and we started the company with $700</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to start i got a sample run made of two shampoos and a conditioner</s>
<s>we had two weeks before the first bill was due</s>
<s>so i went knocking on salon doors and got 12 orders and checks then went to paris ace beauty supplies our first distributor</s>
<s>they agreed to take our line on and we paid our first bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i had parked my car on mulholland drive because it was safe there</s>
<s>one day the actress joanna pettet who appeared in the tv series dr kildare and knots landing knocked on my car</s>
<s>we knew each other from years past and she said i could have a room in her house free for two months but id have to pay rent after that</s>
<s>so i got a post office box for $15 and got some cards printed up saying john paul mitchell systems with her phone number on it</s>
<s>when you called youd hear her english accent on the answering machine saying jp will call you back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the first two years it was hand to mouth</s>
<s>after two years paul and i had made close to $1 million gross and had enough to give ourselves each a $2000 dividend</s>
<s>we had no loans</s>
<s>everything was in inventory</s>
<s>it wasnt nationwide yet but we were in a number of salons</s>
<s>it got rolling and rolling until it got into the hundreds of millions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ive always supported environmental causes and in 1986 a businessman named michael gustin asked if id want to fund a company that does advanced exploration of gas and oil with ecology in mind</s>
<s>i said yes so we started gustin energy cos</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1989 my partner paul mitchell died and i started the patrón spirits co with my friend martin crowley an architect whod gone to mexico to do some work</s>
<s>i said bring me back some tequila</s>
<s>he found a handblown bottle and said i could design a label for this</s>
<s>want to make a smoother tequila and go into business</s>
<s> so i decided to make the first 12000 bottles</s>
<s>blue agave is so expensive but even at $37 a bottle i believed the world was ready for a highend product</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my friend clint eastwood put patrón in his movie in the line of fire and wolfgang puck turned all his friends on to it</s>
<s>at paul mitchell we gave it free to people at events</s>

<p>
<s>starting so many businesses was just what happened</s>
<s>the key is to be excited and passionate about what you are starting and the quality with which you produce something</s>
<s>its amazing what a human is capable of doing if they really like something</s>
<s>im not a great detail man</s>
<s>thank god for accountants and assistants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the majority of my time is spent with john paul mitchell systems as ceo and chairman</s>
<s>the company is privately held and we continue to grow every year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the rest of my companies i have great presidents who handle things</s>
<s>all my businesses were started out of personal interests</s>
<s>dejoria diamonds for example sells conflictfree diamonds</s>
<s>it was a way to make a statement and help change the world</s>
<s>success unshared is failure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>be prepared for rejection</s>
<s>if youre prepared you wont stop after the first few doors get slammed in your face</s>
<s>in my early twenties i sold encyclopedias door to door</s>
<s>when you have 10 to 15 doors slammed in your face you still need to be as enthusiastic at door no</s>
<s>16 as you were at door no</s>
<s>1</s>
<s>the average career of an encyclopedia salesman was three days</s>
<s>i worked for colliers for 3 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>make the highestquality products</s>
<s>a lot of people make things to sell</s>
<s>but when the product is old the consumer tosses it out and buys something else</s>
<s>if you make things with the highest quality youll be in the reorder business which keeps the sales growing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>practice sustainability</s>
<s>we looked at costs in our warehouse system  everything from what doors can we shut to what lights can we change</s>
<s>we found ways to create a 25 savings in our power costs</s>
<s>we plant trees to offset our tea tree shampoo line to make up for the carbon we use</s>
<s>its good for the world and good for business</s>
