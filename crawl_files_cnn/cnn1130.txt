<s>new york cnnmoney  europes latest rescue fund cleared a major hurdle wednesday after a high court in germany refused a request to block its ratification</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the german constitutional court ruled against a group of conservative politicians who requested an injunction that would bar germany from ratifying the treaty governing the european stability mechanism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ruling means german president joachim gauck will be able to sign legislation backing the esm treaty which was passed by the parliament in june</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however the court decided that germanys €190 billion contribution to the fund cannot be increased without the consent of the german esm representative</s>
<s>it also affirmed the rights of the german parliament to be consulted on how germanys contribution to the fund is spent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the esm board of governors will hold their first meeting on october 8 according to a statement from eurogroup president jeanclaude juncker</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the courts decision saying it is a good day for germany it is a good day for europe</s>

<p>
<s>the esm is a key component of the breakthrough agreement that european union leaders announced in june to help stabilize the euro currency union</s>
<s>it is also an important part of new bond buying program announced last week by the european central bank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fund will eventually have €500 billion in capital paid in by governments over a period of years to provide loans for troubled members of the 17nation currency union</s>
<s>it is designed to replace the european financial stability facility which has backed bailouts for greece portugal and ireland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however economists warn that the esm cannot solve the underlying problems in the euro area where many governments are struggling to cut public debt amid a deepening economic recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ruling represents another big step towards defusing the euro crisis said holger schmieding senior economist at berenberg bank</s>
<s>however the euro crisis is not over yet he added</s>
<s>it comes in waves</s>
<s>grave risks are still ahead</s>

<p>
<s>the courts decision is preliminary with a final ruling on the legality of the esm treaty expected later this year</s>
<s>but analysts say the courts president has made it clear that the final ruling will not deviate from wednesdays announcement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>timo klien an economist at ihs global insight in frankfurt said the court will need to decide whether the ecbs bond buying program circumvents the cap on germanys contribution to the esm</s>
<s>this part may still entail risks for financial markets he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition the courts decision to restrict germanys contribution represents an implicit rejection of plans to boost the firepower of the esm by granting it a banking license according to schmieding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>germany cannot allow the esm to leverage itself up so that the potential german maximum liability could exceed the cap he wrote in an email</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile the court also supported the socalled fiscal compact that german chancellor angela merkel and most other eu leaders signed in march</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fiscal compact will become binding after 12 of the 17 euro area nations have ratified the treaty according to juncker</s>
<s>but it will not enter into force before january 1 2013 he added</s>
