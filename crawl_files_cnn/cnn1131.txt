<s>we should not wait to shore up social security and medicare said treasury secretary tim geithner</s>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  social security and medicare  the countrys two biggest entitlement programs  will run dry earlier than expected according a report friday from the programs trustees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after the programs trust funds are exhausted social security and medicare will be taking in only enough money to pay a portion of promised benefits to retirees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>combined the cost of the programs represented 84 of the size of the nations economy last year  a figure that would jump to 118 by 2035</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reason the number of beneficiaries will explode as more baby boomers retire and lower birth rates will slow growth in the number of workers paying into the system</s>
<s>how entitlements will eat up tax dollars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>treasury secretary tim geithner urged policymakers to take steps to shore up the two programs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we should not wait for the trust funds to be exhausted to make the reforms necessary to protect our current and future retirees he said</s>
<s>larger more difficult adjustments will be necessary if we delay reform</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>social security will have sufficient resources to pay 100 of promised benefits through 2036</s>
<s>thats one year earlier than last years forecast because the economic recovery has been slower than expected and seniors are living longer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after 2036 the program will only be able to pay 77 of promised benefits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last year was the first time the program took in less payroll tax revenue than the benefits paid out</s>
<s>the difference was made up by the interest paid to the program by its trust fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that fund reflects the $26 trillion of surplus revenue paid into the program since 1983</s>
<s>the surplus revenue however was spent over the years by the government and in exchange it issued nonmarketable us bonds to the trust fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the program starts redeeming those bonds the treasury will need to either borrow more money raise taxes or cut spending since the country is already operating in deficit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the financial outlook for social security disability benefits which is included in the overall trust fund is considerably worse than it is for retirement benefits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the trust fund money dedicated to disability benefits which are paid to people who cant work because of a medical condition is projected to run out by 2018</s>
<s>the programs costs have been outpacing its noninterest income since 2005</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one way to grasp the size of social securitys longterm shortfall including the disability program is to consider how much the 124 payroll tax rate on the first $106800 of a workers wages would need to go up immediately to ensure the program can pay full benefits over the next 75 years</s>
<s>the trustees estimate that it would need to be reset at 1462</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>put another way the trust fund would need an additional $65 trillion in current dollars to pay all scheduled benefits in full over the next 75 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile medicares hospital insurance program otherwise known as part a should be able to pay full benefits through 2024 the trustees project</s>
<s>that is five years earlier than they predicted last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but 2024 is still eight years later than had been projected before congress passed the new health reform law</s>
<s>the ugly math of medicare</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as he did last year however the programs chief actuary richard foster expressed strong skepticism about the reports assumptions that the new health reform law will be carried out as written</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the reasons for his skepticism the trustees report assumes that scheduled reductions in fees to medicare doctors will take place even though congress regularly overrides such reductions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by 2025 the hospital trust fund will have run out and the program will be able to pay only 90 of hospital costs</s>
<s>by 2045 that share will drop to 75 before gradually climbing back up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to cure the programs longterm shortfall the 145 medicare payroll tax rate on all of a workers wages would need to increase by just under 1 percentage point starting today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition to part a the main medicare benefit there are two supplementary programs part b for doctor bills and part d for drug coverage</s>
<s>they are funded solely by general tax revenue and patientpaid premiums</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>costs for those programs however are set to rise rapidly  and that means growing pressure on the federal budget and seniorsÂ </s>
