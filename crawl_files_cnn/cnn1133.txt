<s>house speaker john boehner has said everything is on the table except tax increases</s>
<s>that makes a deal on debt hard to reach and debt reduction hard to accomplish</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  trillions in spending cuts</s>
<s>no tax increases</s>
<s>no kidding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is house speaker john boehners opening bid in negotiations over raising the debt ceiling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>politically the boehner parameters arent likely to fly</s>
<s>president obama and other democrats have already made clear they want to reduce debt through a combination of spending cuts and increased tax revenue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but practically can the country live with a regimen of spending cuts alone</s>
<s>its unlikely since the changes could end up being too severe to be palatable fiscal experts say</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just to keep the countrys total debt where it is now  around 60 of gdp  without tax increases lawmakers would need to cut spending today by 35 or about $12 trillion according to the government accountability office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats almost as much as what the country spends on defense and other discretionary spending  ie nearly everything americans expect their federal government to do outside of providing medicare medicaid and social security benefits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>keep in mind too that stabilizing public debt at 60 likely wont be enough because its still well above the countrys historical average  which is under 40</s>
<s>translation even more cutting would be necessary in subsequent decades</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another reason that a spendingcutsonly debtreduction plan may not be the best option it likely would require less of a sacrifice from the wealthy than from everyone else</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and any plan lawmakers agree to has to be seen as credible by the markets since the push to bring deficits down is driven by a fear that bond investors at some point may turn tail on us treasurys</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a reuters survey this week suggests that spending cuts alone wouldnt fly</s>
<s>a majority of bond firm economists and fund managers said that tax increases in addition to spending cuts must be part of the solution</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not clear how many trillions boehner and the gop will aim for in spending cuts or over what time period</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>capitol hill aides believe lawmakers will seek a $2 trillion increase in the debt ceiling and boehner has said spending cuts will need to exceed any debt ceiling increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the gops demands for spending cuts end up in the $2 trillion range over 10 years that would be on par with the amount of spending cuts called for by president obamas bipartisan debt commission not including interest savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the commission proposed $12 trillion worth of discretionary spending cuts that leaned most heavily on defense</s>
<s>it also called for $400 billion in health savings and roughly $300 billion in mandatory spending cuts said marc goldwein policy director of the committee for a responsible federal budget who also worked on the fiscal commission staff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but heres the catch the democrats who supported the proposal did so because it was part of a comprehensive plan that included revenue increases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its also not clear whether republicans will eventually agree to curb tax breaks which many consider a form a government spending through the tax code</s>
<s>the elimination of such breaks  a key element in the debt commissions proposal  is a way to raise more revenue without actually raising tax rates</s>
<s>blowing up the tax code</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sen jon kyl who is part of the debt ceiling negotiations led by vice president joe biden suggested in a radio show with larry kudlow that the debt ceiling talks may not be the best forum to discuss tax reform</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im not sure this is the place to do that we will not consider tax increases as a part of this discussion kyl said</s>
<s>as a result its a little difficult to talk about progrowth tax reform because one of the elements is the elimination of  tax expenditures</s>
<s>when you do that somebodys taxes actually go up</s>
