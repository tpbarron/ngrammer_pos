<s>new york cnnmoney  the international monetary fund urged euro area policy makers wednesday to address the worsening crisis in the currency zone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eurozone authorities have made some progress but stronger more collective action is needed according to an imf review of policies in the 17nation currency union</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the current situation in the eurozone is at critical state said mahmood pradhan deputy director of the imfs european department in a conference call with reporters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>specifically the imf recommends forming a banking union with common deposit insurance and a mechanism to resolve failed banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eurozone leaders agreed last month to move towards more integrated oversight of the financial system but stopped short of a full fledged banking union</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the goal is to break the pernicious link between banks and governments in which weak financial institutions threaten to drag down states and vice versa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is vital that they make more progress towards a banking union said pradhan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the eurozone banking system is fragmented pradhan added as governments encourage domestic banks to maintain liquidity</s>
<s>as a result pradhan said a banking union is important to ensure that access to credit is spread more evenly across the euro area</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we hope they will follow up with a deposit insurance and resolution framework he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition to joint banking regulation the imf called for deeper fiscal integration in the euro area</s>
<s>a more centralized approach to national budgets could help reduce the tendency for economic shocks in one country to imperil the euro area as a whole the report states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eurozone leaders also need to take steps to boost economic activity including structural reforms in uncompetitive regions and targeted spending in more well off nations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the european central bank which recently cut interest rates to an alltime low can do more the imf said</s>
<s>pradhan thinks the ecb could lower interest rates further offer more lowcost loans or scale up its controversial bond buying program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the imf stressed that eurozone leaders need to act quickly to ward off a deepening crisis that could have serious consequences for the rest of europe and the global economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the euro area is in an uncomfortable and unsustainable halfway point the imf said in its report</s>
<s>while it is sufficiently integrated to allow escalating problems in one country to spill over to others it lacks the economic flexibility or policy tools to deal with these spillovers</s>
