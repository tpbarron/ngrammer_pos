<s>spains banking and debt problems have moved to the center of the european sovereign debt crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  with greeces election over the concern of investors and economists has shifted to the larger spanish banking and sovereign debt crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fourth largest economy in the eurozone spain has already asked for €100 billion $1258 billion in assistance from the eu rescue fund to recapitalize its banks</s>
<s>other european countries have voiced support for such a bailout in a effort to keep the problems at spanish banks from spreading to other nations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the depth of the nations crisis has raised doubts about whether €100 billion will be enough to recapitalize the banks</s>
<s>for example the bank of spain the nations central bank released data monday showing that doubtful loans  those that are more than 3 months overdue  rose to €1527 billion in april equal to 87 of all the loans held by the nations banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the volume of troubled bank loans has soared by nearly a third in the last year as spain has fallen into a deep recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i think people have problems accepting numbers on the bailout request said elisabeth afseth fixed income analyst for investec in london</s>
<s>the €100 billion may or may not be enough</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>banco santander san and bbva bbva the two largest banks both had shares plunge more than 4 in madrid and 5 in new york trading</s>
<s>the spanish banks helped take spains ibex composite stock index down nearly 3 on a day that saw londons ftse ukx and the german dax dax close narrowly higher and the paris cac cac40 lose less than 1</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield on spains 10year bond soared to a euroera high of 716 a level that not only raises the nations borrowing costs but is widely seen as unsustainable</s>
<s>but experts say theres little to bring rates down in the near term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you didnt want to buy spanish debt before the bank bailout i see no reason why you would want to do so after said afseth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because the spanish picture is gloomy</s>
<s>spain has record high unemployment of 243 and more than half of all of its young workers are without a job</s>
<s>spanish housing prices which shot up in the warm weather coastal communities during the real estate boom have been cut in half by the crisis</s>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>with spains debt already rated at the lowest level above junk bond status its not clear that the bank bailout will be enough help for the countrys troubled finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a separate bailout of spains government debts on top of its bank bailout could reach at least €300 billion to cover its current refinancing needs and the operating deficit in the next few years said investecs afseth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bank and sovereign bailouts of spain totaling €400 billion would wipe out most of the remaining €557 billion in the existing european bailout fund  not including the €223 billion already committed to help greece portugal and ireland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and that level of help is in some question as more than €500 billion of the money committed to the rescue fund has yet to be contributed by the more prosperous member nations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on sunday the institute of international finance wrote a report to its members saying that the spanish bank bailout by itself may deplete the bailout fund for all but the proposed rescue of a country the size of tiny cyprus</s>

<s>which explains why spain is now front and center among those worried about europe and the worlds financial system </s>
