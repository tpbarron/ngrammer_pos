<p>
<s>fortune  maxine clark the 63yearold founder of buildabear was always a shopper even as a kid</s>
<s>so it made sense that she would wind up in retail</s>
<s>clark eventually made it to the top  as president of payless shoesource</s>
<s>but the job wasnt enough  the spark was gone she said  and she left in 1996</s>
<s>clark then went on a search to find another idea that would rekindle her love for the business</s>
<s>the result a simple shopping trip with a friends daughter produced the idea for a single stuffedanimal factory in the st louis galleria mall in 1997</s>
<s>today buildabear workshop bbw operates 425 stores worldwide</s>
<s>in 2011 it had revenue of $3944 million but showed a small loss largely because of a onetime charge</s>
<s> heres the chief executive bears story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of my favorite things as a child was to go shopping with my mom and looking was as good as buying</s>
<s>i always had a curiosity about how people shopped</s>
<s>in 1971 when i graduated from college i wanted to do anything women werent doing at the time</s>
<s>so i went to work for hecht in washington dc as a retail executive trainee and kept getting promoted up the ladder of may co which was later bought by federated department stores now known as macys m fortune 500</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1976 i was promoted to the may corporate offices in st louis and worked for the ceo on business development special projects and acquisitions</s>
<s>in the 1980s i moved to the discount side of the company and in 1992 i became president of payless shoesource</s>
<s>when i got to the top my financial rewards were very high but my psychic income bank account was nearly empty</s>
<s>i felt the retail world had lost its spark</s>
<s>i wanted to be more creative again so in 1996 i left the company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one day i was shopping with katie burkhardt the daughter of one of my good friends and her brother jack who collected ty beanie babies</s>
<s>when we couldnt find anything new katie picked up a beanie baby and said we could make one</s>
<s>she meant we could go home and make the small bears but i heard something different</s>
<s>her words gave me the idea to create a company that would allow people to create their own customized stuffed animals</s>
<s>i did some research and began putting together a plan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>id been a buyer all over the world so i knew how things were made</s>
<s>i began talking to friends and their kids about this idea</s>
<s>buildabear workshop would be like a theme park factory in a mall</s>
<s>every parent said why would you want to make your own stuffed animal when you can buy it at target tgt fortune 500</s>
<s>but the kids of my friends were so excited about doing it</s>
<s>there were no formal focus groups but from the beginning buildabear workshop has had a cub advisory board which is a group of children who offer their opinions about our products and services</s>
<s>kids have insights and offer inspiration by looking at the world differently</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1997 i withdrew $750000 from my retirement account to get buildabear workshop off the ground</s>
<s>that covered startup costs and the building of the first prototype store</s>
<s>i also secured a bank line of credit for inventory and working capital with my house as collateral</s>
<s>i knew i wanted to build a multimilliondollar business with hundreds of units and i realized i didnt have the ready cash to fund that growth</s>
<s>i knew id have to partner with outside investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while we were building our first store coming soon signs prompted a st louis business journal story about our unique handson concept</s>
<s>the article caught the eye of barney ebsworth who owned a private investment firm and his partner wayne smith</s>
<s>they bought in for 20 for $45 million so with that i had enough to go for several years and we hadnt even opened yet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first store opened in the st louis galleria on a sunday and there were lines out the door</s>
<s>in the beginning landlords didnt know the concept so persuading people to rent us space was hard</s>
<s>in year two we had malls begging us to come in</s>
<s>other investors came in 1998 and 1999</s>
<s>we had to turn investors away after that because the business was so successful we didnt need their money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we started with just bears and clothes</s>
<s>we added shoes and accessories then more animals</s>
<s>we licensed products and started carrying costumes from disney dis fortune 500 and major league baseball teams</s>
<s>we hit a good nerve</s>
<s>at a time when everything was going high tech high touch and handson was a good balance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we started when the internet was just getting popular so we were able to track people in our loyalty program from day one and continually do customer research</s>
<s>were constantly creating new product so theres no niche that needs to be filled</s>
<s>everything is focused on the customers and giving them a good experience</s>
<s>we want to engage kids beyond selling them something in our store</s>
<s>every year we look for 10 children around the country who are doing things to help their communities and we name them our huggable heroes</s>
<s>we focus on good price convenience and location and we hope that when you leave you have a smile on your face</s>
<s>successful retailers  whether its macys or apple aapl fortune 500  do these things</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we began in big cities and when we got up to store 150 we started opening in smaller markets with goodsize family communities and tourist destinations</s>
<s>in 2004 we opened our first overseas store in japan and are now in 19 countries</s>
<s>almost 40 of our store base is outside of the united states and we are putting the support and infrastructure in place to continue this expansion</s>
<s>we also see ecommerce as a growth opportunity  on our website and through mobile technology</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the recession affected the business substantially</s>
<s>we slowed our growth cut costs and mall traffic was down</s>
<s>we strategically closed some stores opened stores in new locations and updated existing locations</s>
<s>now mall traffic is coming back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take your employees seriously</s>
<s>every six weeks we do chief chat at headquarters</s>
<s>employees can ask any questions they want</s>
<s>we get good feedback and understand what matters to our associates</s>
<s>we also do remote conferences with people in the stores by skype and i go to the stores all the time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>write the biggest business plan you can</s>
<s>you can always cut it back</s>
<s>the first purpose of the business plan is to convince yourself that its an idea you really want to do</s>
<s>if youre not convinced youll never be able to convince anyone else</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>understand the value of partnerships</s>
<s>in the beginning our vendors were willing to make a couple hundred pieces of everything</s>
<s>normally they wouldnt do such a small amount</s>
<s>but then they benefited from our success</s>
<s>always ask what can we do together to get more than our moneys worth</s>
