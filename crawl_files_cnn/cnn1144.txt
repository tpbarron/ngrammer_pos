<s>don poffenroth dumped his 401k into a new retirement investment a vodka distillery</s>
<s>see more unusual alternative investments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  don poffenroth spent more than 20 years watching his 401k eke out returns of 3 to 5</s>
<s>until in 2007 he decided to take a bold step he emptied out his 401k into a selfdirected ira and funneled all of his savings  $300000  into a vodka distillery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the time there were only a handful of players in the business and about 40 distilleries in the country</s>
<s>there was all sorts of potential there said poffenroth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>three years later the vodka distillery which is based in spokane wash is bringing in annual revenue of more than $15 million</s>
<s>and poffenroth estimates that his 60 share of the company is worth about $12 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the money the distillery brings in goes directly into poffenroths selfdirected ira where he says it will sit until he retires</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its significantly beyond what the market could have ever dreamed of giving up said poffenroth</s>
<s>if you look at historical gains of 401ks were getting hundreds of times more than that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a result a growing number of investors are losing faith emptying some or all of their traditional retirement funds and reinvesting their money into socalled alternative investments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while many investors stick to lesssexy alternative assets like precious metals or physical currency some opt for some pretty unusual bets</s>
<s>among some of the more exotic examples a hairstyling university chicken feces dressage horses and a habanero pepper farm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investments in alternative assets are expected to increase from an average of 14 of investment portfolios in 2010 to 19 by 2012 according to russell investments most recent survey</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most alternative investors roll over their 401ks to selfdirected iras which have the same tax benefits as traditional iras but allow investors to put their money into a wide variety of assets</s>
<s>while these iras are overseen by advisers who facilitate account transactions and make sure the accounts meet irs guidelines its usually up to the investor to pick the assets</s>
<s>returns are realized when the asset is either sold if its sold for a profit or when the asset creates a product that can be sold such as habanero peppers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just like a conventional ira if the funds are tapped before the holder reaches retirement age they must pay an additional 10 tax on early withdrawals</s>
<s>and the assets still have to qualify as acceptable under irs rules</s>
<s>otherwise investors will face stiff penalties if they withdraw money from a 401k to invest in say collectibles which arent considered acceptable under irs guidelines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact a group of clients were taken for a quartermillion dollars after investing in several cows that were allegedly going to be used in a research experiment at texas am university said hubert bromma ceo of ira custodian entrust</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the promises were just too good to be true bromma said</s>
<s>according to entrusts records the woman running the scheme claimed to be a graduate student from texas am</s>
<s>she said she needed $60000 in order to buy 100 cows that she would then donate to texas am for research</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cows would be bred during the experiment she told the men</s>
<s>so not only would she be able to get the cows back from the university but also the calves</s>
<s>she said shed eventually be able to sell the whole lot for $95000 to a buyer who had already been lined up  giving the investors a more than 50 return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at first the woman doled out returns to attract more investors</s>
<s>but in the end it turned out that the whole thing was a scam the cows never existed the woman wasnt a graduate student and the research program was completely made up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the woman was caught stealing millions of dollars from investors in what bromma calls a cow ponzi scheme</s>
<s> she was sentenced to about 11 years in prison in texas after pleading guilty to the charges according to federal court documents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre not familiar with what youre investing in then youre probably better off sticking to a 401k he said</s>
<s>and since theres often so much risk involved these investments are often better for wealthier folks who are able to stomach more downside risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many banks and big retirement firms like fidelity dont even let clients put their funds in such specialized investments</s>
<s>we dont offer pepper farms or anything as speculative said beth mchugh vice president of market insights at fidelity</s>
<s>even with something like gold which fidelity does offer  while not as unusual its one of the most volatile assets and you really need to understand what you own and how much youre willing to lose</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those who still venture into alternative investing should remember to keep their portfolio diversified</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people need to understand that theres always an upside and downside to any investment so you need to spread out the risk said mchugh</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do you have a job that people would be surprised to learn pays a salary of $100000 or more</s>
