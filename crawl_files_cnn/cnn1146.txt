<p>
<s>in 2008 as many as 1000 polling centers were retrofitted with the companys ramps henderson said</s>
<s>for us the election can be a big revenue generator</s>

<s>according to the us election assistance commission congress gave states about $325 billion from 2003 until 2010 to improve the voting process the vast amount of which was for purchasing fully accessible voting equipment and computerized statewide voter registration lists</s>
<s>but a very small piece of that funding was made available to make polling centers themselves accessible</s>
