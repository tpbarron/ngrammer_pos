<s>splitting up a company to avoid health care reforms employer penalties wont work</s>
<s>instead to avoid bankruptcy business owners like david barr say theyll fire workers and cut hours</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  in the wake of the supreme courts health care decision several companies with 50 or more fulltime workers have embarked on a quest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their aim get below 50 and dodge the employer mandate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the health reform law forces them to start providing insurance by 2014 or pay stiff penalties</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>kari dephillips who coowns the content factory a public relations firm in pittsburgh was hoping she could just break up the company to sidestep the rule</s>
<s>maybe one firm would do marketing while the other builds websites</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the small company is on pace to exceed the 50worker threshold in the next few years</s>
<s>dephillips doesnt want to provide health care and she definitely doesnt want to pay the penalty which would be $2000 per fulltime worker minus the first 30</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a $40000 fine to my company would be catastrophic she said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the only problem with her breakup plan is that it wont work</s>
<s>the government would still consider both of her companies as one</s>
<s>thats because the employer mandate penalty relies on controlled group provisions focusing on who controls the company  not necessarily what they do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its meant to prevent skirting around the law said christopher condeluci a washington dc attorney at the law firm venable who helped draft the rule for the senate finance committee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these rules are intended to snuff out this type of abuse condeluci said</s>
<s>you cannot get around the employer mandate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after hearing about the littleknown rule dephillips took another stab at it start a second company that never existed as part of the first</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>again resistance to the rule is futile</s>
<s>the penalty only looks at who owns part or all of the company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that rule could also ensnare smaller firms though</s>
<s>a business owner who employs 50 or more at completely different companies  say 25 at a car repair shop and 25 at a restaurant  would have to provide insurance at both even if each falls below the threshold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it could also affect married couples</s>
<s>tax law generally assumes a person owns interest in their spouses business condeluci said</s>
<s>that means small business owners who are married to each other should take steps to ensure the internal revenue service which will enforce the mandate wont combine their staff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its difficult to navigate the tax rules and one misstep could pull them into the employer mandate condeluci said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its still unclear how the irs will enforce the rules according to jennifer kraft a labor attorney with the seyfarth shaw law firm in chicago</s>
<s>however any prolonged battle would have to be sorted out in court</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other way business owners are planning to deal with the law is a devastating one</s>
<s>they plan to cut staff and switch fulltime employees to parttime which the law classifies as less than 30 hours per week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the reality for the 425 workers at david barrs nearly two dozen kfcs and taco bells across alabama and georgia</s>
<s>barr has already done the math</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he currently provides health care for managerial staff only and it costs him about $125000 to cover the 30 who take it</s>
<s>extending that to every fulltimer would cost him another $545782 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>health reforms creation of state insurance exchanges promises to bring down those costs but barr said any expenses even close to that will still outmatch his available cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this business model isnt meant to support those costs he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to minimize expenses hell fire workers and cut hours to reduce the number of fulltimers to 60</s>
<s>then hell opt for the penalty instead of paying insurance</s>
<s>a $60000 fine pales in comparison to the huge potential rise in health care costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cashiers would be replaced by selforder kiosks cooks with chicken breading machines</s>
<s>these options are too expensive now he said but they would make sense then</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but killing off jobs will also violate one of barrs guiding principles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we have a responsibility to provide a good position that allows people a sense of pride in their work barr said</s>
<s>and id rather provide that for many than provide health care for few</s>
