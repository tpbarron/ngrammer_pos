<s>money magazine  youd think that investors would be leery of companies that own and manage commercial real estate</s>
<s>vacancy rates remain elevated in office buildings and shopping centers</s>
<s>except for apartment buildings rents really havent grown at all in four years</s>
<s>and given the possibility that the global economy may retrench yet again things could still get worse before they get better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet last year nine times as much money poured into funds that invest in real estate investment trusts or reits as did in 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats behind this rush of investors</s>
<s>the same force that sent tens of thousands of americans racing into oklahoma in the great land run of 1889 the hope of nabbing property that could help sustain them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with bonds paying nexttonothing interest rates yieldstarved investors are hungry for payouts and reits pass along the vast majority of the income their properties generate</s>
<s>the yield on equity reits which own and manage commercial holdings averages just under 4 though some are paying much more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by historical standards thats actually modest</s>
<s>when pitted against the sub2 yields on 10year treasuries though or the 3 payout of a total bond market fund reits shine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is a hunt for yield says mark luschini chief investment strategist at janney montgomery scott noting that investors dont seem to care where they have to go to collect income as long as theyre being paid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>therein lies the problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the long run reits deserve a 5 to 10 stake in your portfolio because they are a good hedge against inflation and help diversify your sources of income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for instance while your bonds might be hurt if inflation and interest rates were to rise in an improving economy equity reit income could thrive</s>
<s>we think reits can grow their dividends at least 6 a year and if inflation is running at 3 your purchasing value is not being eroded says thomas bohjalian a portfolio manager at cohen  steers an investment firm specializing in real estate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet investors who are moving into reits to boost their income cant turn a blind eye to the risks</s>
<s>equity reits have soared 192 since march 2009 double the gains for the sp 500</s>
<s>and as valuations have risen yields have started to sink</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre thinking of going with other types of reits that promise even fatter payouts such as those that arent publicly traded or that invest largely in mortgages you have to mindful of their complexities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so before you rush into this space get to know the landscape and the funds that will help you avoid the quicksand</s>
<s>typically money favors index funds because of their low costs</s>
<s>in this market though a better bet says ralph block author of investing in reits is a stock picker who can weed out soso companies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>publicly traded firms that own and operate commercial properties represent the biggest part of the reit universe</s>
<s>yet even this area of the market comes with big challenges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reits are riskier than bonds</s>
<s>trying to substitute commercial real estate for treasuries or other fixedincome investments would be a big mistake</s>
<s>while bonds have historically been negatively correlated with stocks  meaning they zig when equities zag  equity reits have recently enjoyed about an 80 correlation with the sp 500</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more to really raise your income youd have to add copious amounts of these investments to your portfolio</s>
<s>a 5 to 10 weighting in a reit fund yielding a little under 4 would only modestly lift the income you get from a bond portfolio yielding 3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to really move the dial you might have to shift as much as a third or more of your portfolio into these investments which would be way too risky</s>
<s>had you done that in 2008 youd have gotten slammed as reits lost around 38 that year while a total bond market index fund gained 5</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these are economically sensitive investments</s>
<s>high unemployment and weak consumers could help push vacancy rates up or rents down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not enough just to see economic growth says david lee manager of the t rowe price real estate fund</s>
<s>we need people moving into offices and business people checking into hotels</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the aftermath of the financial crisis vacancy rates in office buildings shot up from 125 in 2007 to 176 in 2010 according to reis a real estate research firm</s>
<s>theyve barely budged since</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reits are expensive</s>
<s>you could set your sights on areas of the market that have held up in the recent downturn such as apartments that are benefiting from the housing bust</s>
<s>reits in these areas though arent paying you much for the risk</s>
<s>many apartment reits are yielding just under 3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you want to bet on healthier parts of the market  go with cohen  steers realty shares csrsx which is a member of the money 70 our list of recommended mutual and exchangetraded funds</s>
<s>the managers of this $37 billion portfolio currently favor highend retail properties</s>
<s>in fact the funds largest holding is simon property group spg the countrys biggest reit which owns and operates highquality regional malls throughout the country</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>arent shopping centers suffering from the weak consumer economy</s>
<s>not higherend properties</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact customers are opening their pocketbooks in welllocated malls and tenants are willing to pay to keep their shops there says bohjalian</s>
<s>he adds higherend retail continues to do particularly well</s>
<s> cohen  steers realty also favors apartments where leases tend to be shorter which means tenants can be reupped quickly at higher rents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neuberger berman real estate nreax also currently favors regional malls and apartments</s>
<s>if particular sectors look attractive we want to be overweight in those areas says steve shigekawa comanager of the fund</s>
</p>

<s>this willingness to concentrate on growth areas helped neuberger berman real estate outperform the average reit fund from 2002 to 2007 when the economy was expanding as well as from 2009 to 2011 says morningstar analyst rob wherry</s>

<p>

<s>play it safe by seeking out bargain hunters that spread their bets across the broad reit universe</s>
<s>managers andrew davis and chandler spears of davis real estate rpfrx for instance seek out reits that not only are cheap but can also stand up to different business climates</s>
