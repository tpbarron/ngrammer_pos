<s>new york cnnmoney  spain appears to have crossed a red line in the bond market where investors are increasingly convinced that the government will need to be bailed out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield on 10year spanish bonds rose to a euroera record of 7565 monday as demand for the governments debt has all but evaporated</s>
<s>at that level madrids borrowing costs are now firmly above the 7 threshold widely considered unsustainable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those levels indicate that spain may soon struggle to fund itself in the market said gary jenkins a fixedincome analyst at swordfish research</s>
<s>and therefore unless some positive action is taken the country will need a full bailout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spain requested up to €100 billion in bailout funds to recapitalize the nations banking sector in the wake of a major property bust</s>
<s>eurozone finance ministers agreed last week on the terms of that loan agreement but it remains unclear whether the cost will fall on the government or not</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>analysts say bailout funds cannot be injected directly into spanish banks until a eurozonewide banking authority is established  a process that could take months if not years</s>
<s>in the meantime the loans could end up adding to the debts of the spanish government which is already struggling to reduce its deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition investors are concerned that the central government in spain will be on the hook for the debts of several regional governments</s>
<s>on friday valencia one of spains semiautonomous regions requested such a bailout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors fear that up to six other regional governments including catalonia could make similar requests for aid</s>
<s>that could severely tax the €18 billion bailout fund spain set up to help the regions</s>

</p>

<p>
