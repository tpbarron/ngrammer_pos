<p>
<s>the nation which is doing everything it can to avoid a bailout will release its 2013 budget on thursday</s>
<s>and friday brings auditors results of bank stress tests which could give investors a better idea of just how deep spains banking troubles run</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a bailout seemed inevitable a few months back when spains borrowing costs were sitting at unsustainably high levels</s>
<s>but ever since the european central bank announced an intervention plan those costs have come down sharply</s>
<s>just two months ago the 10year yield was above 76</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but trouble is brewing once again</s>
<s>catalonia  spains richest region  said wednesday it would hold elections in november two years ahead of schedule</s>
<s>and antiausterity protests in madrid turned violent ahead of the governments budget release</s>
<s>this news helped lift the yield on spains 10year bond back above 6 for the first time in weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>analysts also point out that talk is cheap and more concrete action is necessary</s>
<s>the ecb hasnt actually done anything yet and spain has some fundamental issues it needs to overcome before its out of the woods</s>

<s>spain has been in recession since april and analysts think it will get worse before it gets better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bank of spain said wednesday that it expects economic activity in the second quarter to continue to weaken</s>
<s>it estimated that gross domestic product will shrink 13</s>
<s>that would be the third straight quarter of contraction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with record high unemployment of nearly 25 job creation is sorely needed</s>
<s>meanwhile spanish prime minister mariano rajoy said in july that the country would cut €65 billion from the budget in three years by raising taxes and shrinking bureaucracy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are high levels of private sector debt as firms and households deleverage said may</s>
<s>even if spain has manageable borrowing costs its not the end of spains problems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spain does have an option though</s>
<s>thanks to the ecb the government could ask for a bailout</s>
<s>but that would require committing to budget reforms and outside surveillance through the european stability mechanism or its predecessor the european financial stability facility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far rajoy has been resisting that move</s>
<s>he doesnt want to go hat in hand to the eu said nick stamenkovic market strategist with ria capital markets in edinburgh</s>
<s>i dont think theyll do it voluntarily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and why should he</s>
<s>the lower borrowing costs have helped ease the pressure substantially</s>
<s>but that could prove to be a dangerous move</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if bond yields continue to surge like they did wednesday rajoy may be forced to seek a bailout with lessthanfavorable terms</s>
<s>stamenkovic thinks that is inevitable</s>
<s>the question is when and what will be attached</s>

<p>
<s>in june spain asked for up to €100 billion as a capital buffer for its ailing banks</s>
<s>it followed that up with a formal request to the eurogroup  the 17 nations that use the euro as their common currency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the international monetary fund has previously estimated spains banks would need around €40 billion while others have put that figure closer to €60 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the devil is in the details</s>
<s>standard life investments bank credit analyst andrew fraser points out that banks are being critical of the assumptions being used to justify that figure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and may noted that if youve got a really small estimate its because its based on an optimistic assessment</s>
<s> so the top line may not paint the full picture</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors seem nervous as well</s>
<s>spains benchmark ibex 35 index has fallen nearly 5 from the start of the year making it one of only two major global stock markets to be down in 2012</s>
<s>china is the other</s>
