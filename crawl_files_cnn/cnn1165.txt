<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  even as the economy has slowed the nations visa system remains a high hurdle for foreigners who want to start businesses and create jobs in the united states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>few viable options exist for entrepreneurs eager to come to america and those that do offer little predictability</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example the investor visa carries a $1 million price tag  too high for most aspiring small business owners</s>
<s>and the socalled executive visa requires immigrants to start a firm abroad and create a us subsidiary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for those who want to launch in the united states the principal route is through e2 visas</s>
<s>but theyre available only to people in certain nations prohibiting entry from the worlds most promising countries such as brazil india and china</s>
<s>also they must be renewed every few years and offer no path to permanent residency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us policies are at odds with other countries that are opening doors for entrepreneurs</s>
<s>they have the ideas build the companies create the jobs</s>
<s>why not invite them in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chile does it by offering $40000 of equityfree capital and temporary visas</s>
<s>singapore sets a low bar for entrepasses and creates an avenue for residency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile the us immigration system can be openly hostile say business owners advocates and lawyers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for a british couple who came in 1995 to manage a hotel and restaurant in missouri it might mean soon sending their eldest daughter back to a country she barely knows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ali and ian gray came on e2 visas and the program allowed them to bring lauren then four years old</s>
<s>she grew up on the flat plains was a cheerleader in high school and studied dance at a nearby womens college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but she will no longer be able to stay on her parents visa as of wednesday when she turns 21</s>
<s>she can try and get her own visa but shes been on that list since she was 12</s>
<s>the us immigration system is so backlogged shes still in line</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its just not right and not fair</s>
<s>i am an american lauren said</s>
<s>i had so many plans here so many options so many connections</s>
<s>im going to have to learn an entire new culture</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no consideration is given to her familys economic contribution to the tiny midwestern town of trenton where theyve doubled the staff at the lakeview motor lodge and restaurant to 30</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a lastditch effort lauren and her mother traveled to washington dc last week to meet with congressional staffers to plead for a solution</s>
<s>they faced resistance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its so frustrating lauren gray said</s>
<s>they know the system is broken but they still enforce it</s>
<s>no one seems to think anything can be changed so theyve given up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the family is trying to get an exemption but its still uncertain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for entrepreneurs with an eye toward the united states its an ominous warning you can come here and hire americans but expect no gratitude</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another problem with the e2 visa is that renewals arent guaranteed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a married couple from ireland that owns a restaurant in new england experienced that first hand earlier this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in february they returned to ireland to renew their visas as they had done every two years for almost a decade</s>
<s>while there us immigration officials denied the renewal and wouldnt let them back in to shut their business</s>
<s>the restaurant which had three employees eventually closed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it took six weeks and creative legal moves to get them in temporarily and reunite them with their children</s>
<s>theyve asked to remain unnamed fearing retribution in a system without recourse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still the e2 visa program is popular</s>
<s>since 2009 at least 33000 applications have been filed every year on average 25926 visas were issued annually</s>
<s>but its narrow options discourage investment said brent renison a portland ore immigration attorney representing the grays</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people need to be assured that if theyre putting all this money into the united states they can stay here renison said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us state department which issues visas told cnnmoney it can only follow orders from congress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a proposal that seeks to change that was introduced in a house bill in late july by rep john conyers a democrat</s>
<s>it would offer green cards to business owners here on e2 visas who hire at least five americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bills republican cosponsor rep jason chaffetz said it starts to chip away at a system that is broken top to bottom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if we fix legal immigration the country will be better off chaffetz said</s>
<s>its good for our economy and its good for our vitality</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however its doubtful whether congress can come together to address an issue as divisive and complex as immigration especially during an election yearÂ </s>
