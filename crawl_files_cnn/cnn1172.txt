<s>as youve learned building a wellbalanced portfolio is trickier than spreading your money among a handful of funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason is that you cant always tell how a mutual fund will deploy its assets  a name may provide little clue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while checking a funds investment category at morningstarcom can give you a better idea managers still have leeway to veer off in surprising directions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets say that last year you invested in parnassus parnx hartford capital appreciation ithix and fairholme fairx funds</s>
<s>all three own big stocks but parnassus focuses on growth shares fairholme emphasizes undervalued companies and hartford blends those two approaches</s>
<s>so you might reasonably conclude that you owned a wellrounded group of largecompany stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in reality however your portfolio would have been seriously skewed as you can see in the graphic</s>
<s>fairholme had more than 70 of its assets in financial stocks last year including bank of america bac fortune 500</s>
<s>parnassus stuffed more than half its assets into tech firms like google goog fortune 500</s>
<s>all three are domestic stock funds but 19 of your money would have been in foreign shares</s>
<s>you can do this same exercise by revving up morningstars portfolio xray free at t rowe prices website registration required and available to morningstar subscribers $21 a month $185 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by taking 15 to 30 minutes to plug in your holdings and click through views  by asset class investment style or industry sector for example  you should have no trouble telling whether your portfolio is well diversified compared with market benchmarks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the proportions are off by only a few percentage points relax minor deviations arent likely to dramatically affect performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if your portfolio is out of whack by say five percentage points or more in any area you may want to replace a fund whose holdings are especially lopsided with one that more closely tracks the broad market</s>
<s>or to get more exposure where you need it  tech health care whatever  you can add a sector fund or an exchangetraded fund that tracks that particular area of the market</s>
<s>just be careful that you dont create new imbalances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an alternative to this finetuning is to stick to index funds and etfs that track broad benchmarks which have the added advantage of low fees</s>
<s>with just a total stock market index total bond index and total international index  all available on our money 70 list of recommended funds  you can create a wellbalanced global portfolio thats easy to maintain</s>
