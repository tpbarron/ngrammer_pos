<s>new york cnnmoney  seniors got good news on wednesday their social security checks will go up 36 next year because of a costofliving increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that also means an estimated 10 million highincome workers may be paying a bigger tax bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because the inflation that justifies the benefit increase also will raise the amount of income subject to the portion of the payroll tax supporting social security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>currently workers pay the tax on the first $106800 of income</s>
<s>starting next year they will pay it on the first $110100</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>normally the tax rate is 62 for workers and 62 for employers</s>
<s>those who are selfemployed pay the full 124</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but this year workers have only paid 42 thanks to a temporary payroll tax holiday that congress passed last december</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not clear yet what the rate for 2012 will be</s>
<s>if president obama has his way it will be temporarily cut even further  to 31</s>
<s>otherwise it may be maintained at 42 or revert to 62 as it is scheduled to under current law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this year people making $110100 are paying $4486 into social security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next year if the rate reverts to 62 theyd pay $2341 more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the rate stays at 42 theyd pay $139 more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and if its reduced to 31 theyd pay $1073 less</s>

<p>
<s>proponents who support an extended payroll tax holiday say letting it expire would hurt the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>opponents say the idea is not very effective as economic stimulus</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to help close social securitys longterm financing shortfall budget experts have recommended increasing the amount of income subject to the payroll tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one proposal is to raise the cap to a level where the payroll tax is covering 90 of wages earned in the country as it used to for years</s>
</p>

<p>

<s>under that proposal the taxable maximum would be $190000 in 2020 up from the $168000 currently projectedÂ </s>
