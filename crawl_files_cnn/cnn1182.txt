<p>

<s>shaichs story</s>

<p>
<s>as a kid in livingston nj i had no real interest in business</s>
<s>i always thought i wanted to do something in government or social policy</s>
<s>i worked for congressman frank thompson jr and on campaigns in washington and then went off to clark university in worcester mass</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my sophomore year i was at a local convenience store with some friends</s>
<s>they really didnt want students there and we were tossed out for supposedly shoplifting</s>
<s>i said to a friend the heck with these guys</s>
<s>why dont we open our own store</s>
<s> i had been elected treasurer of the student body and i thought we could raise the money</s>
<s>we opened the beginning of my junior year and i ran it</s>
<s>it was the most wonderful thing i ever did</s>
<s>for someone who cant dance or sing it was the closest i ever came to being an artist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the student store became an institution at clark</s>
<s>i started speaking around the country about student government opening their own stores and people kept telling me i could probably get into harvard business school so in 1977 i applied and got in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after i graduated i went to work in ohio for the original cookie co a small chain of stores run by cole national</s>
<s>it merged with mrs fields cookies in the 1990s</s>
<s> i had this idea of opening urban cookie stores and was tempted to go out on my own</s>
<s>i came back to boston but no one would lease me any space</s>
<s>i ended up going to work for a democratic political consultant</s>
<s>i was there a year when a little jewelry store that had two locations in the same block agreed to sublease me 400 square feet</s>
<s>in august 1980 i opened the cookie jar</s>
<s>i thought id go up one day a week to the store and back to dc to run campaigns</s>
<s>one day very quickly became three which became four</s>
<s>this was mine and somehow it felt completely different</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was tiny and i wanted more</s>
<s>to expand my offerings i became a licensee of a french bakery company au bon pain in late 1980 and put in french baked goods like croissants at the cookie jar in the morning</s>
<s>au bon pain had three stores and the founder louis kane was trying to sell the business because it was under so much debt</s>
<s>i remember going to my dad who was a cpa and he said ron if you can get any of it its not worth having and if its worth having youre not going to get any of it</s>
<s> but i wanted this desperately</s>
<s>so in 1981 the cookie jar and the three debtladen au bon pains were combined into one company</s>
<s>my father and i got 60 of the company and lou and his investors split the remaining 40</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by 1984 i was worried because the french baked goods we sold at our halfadozen stores were becoming pedestrianized</s>
<s>we decided to use the croissant and bread as a platform to sell soups salads and sandwiches</s>
<s>we opened our first french bakerycafé in bostons copley place and by 1991 the year morgan stanley took us public we had 125 stores</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the very thing that had made au bon pain a success up until that point was the thing that limited it</s>
<s>it was a powerful niche business working well in big cities</s>
<s>in 1993 i met with a couple of guys who had a 19store chain called st louis bread co which was a lunchtime soup salad sandwich place</s>
<s>i was impressed</s>
<s>we knew how to take something from 50 to 1000 and it was the gateway to the suburban marketplace for au bon pain</s>
<s>we bought it for $23 million and then didnt change it</s>
<s>for two years we studied it</s>
<s>i was trying to figure out what was going on in consumer society</s>
<s>there had been a huge amount of consolidation in every industry</s>
<s>every shopping strip and mall was the same</s>
<s>in response there was a drive for specialness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we began to conceptualize st louis bread as a gatheringplace business</s>
<s>we created a new physical environment for the café</s>
<s>we started rolling out bagels breakfast and a takehomebread business</s>
<s>in 1998 as we built out st louis bread we made the decision to change the name to panera a word that has roots in breadbasket in latin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the mid1990s we were running the company as four divisions au bon pain international manufacturing and panera</s>
<s>meanwhile the stock had been flat for three years</s>
<s>i realized panera was the gem and it was buried</s>
<s>i knew i should sell everything else off and bet the whole thing on panera</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i brought it to the board and there was a huge disagreement</s>
<s>au bon pain was the namesake</s>
<s>we were selling it all to bet on the little one</s>
<s>it was a painful process</s>
<s>many of the people i had grown up with at the company were sold off with au bon pain</s>
<s>in 1999 we ended up with a public company with one division panera which had about 180 bakerycafés and a pristine balance sheet with a bunch of cash</s>
<s>i got on a plane and moved my family to st louis</s>
<s>we have come from a continuous process of smart bets like that one</s>
<s>take antibioticfree allnatural chicken</s>
<s>we had it before there was a market for it so we had to build a manufacturing supply chain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a few years ago i started thinking about how i wanted to have another experience in my life</s>
<s>i wanted to know what it felt like without panera</s>
<s>in 2010 i handed off the ceo job to bill moreton whom i worked with for 10 years</s>
<s>the idea was id spend two to three days a week on panera on the creative stuff</s>
<s>id have time to look into my other interests like politics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it took me four weeks to realize my continued intellectual interest in panera</s>
<s>i was liberated to create much more value than i ever could in the existing role of ceo when i was freed from daytoday details</s>
<s>bill got it but we spent hours talking before deciding i would come back as coceo</s>
<s>he could have said i signed on as ceo</s>
<s>i dont need the founder back</s>
<s> and i could have said im the largest individual shareholder  i dont need to be coceo</s>
<s> it worked because we both want the same thing for panera</s>
<s>now im focused on all things that create value through how we compete  marketing food</s>
<s>bill covers all things related to how we operate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of the first projects i launched after stepping down as ceo was panera cares</s>
<s>panera has always had a commitment to community</s>
<s>we give $100 million a year in cash and product but i got this feeling that it was disconnected from us</s>
<s>one day im watching nbc news and its the height of the recession</s>
<s>i hear about a paywhatyoucan café in denver</s>
<s>they spent years trying to get this thing open</s>
<s>we open a café every 75 hours</s>
<s>we decided to do the full panera experience open a bakerycafé identical to any other panera and list a suggested donation</s>
<s>we opened our first panera cares café in 2010 and just opened our fourth</s>
<s>theyll serve about 1 million people this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these days i spend a lot of time thinking about how id compete with panera if i werent panera</s>
<s>much of our competitive differentiation will stem from what technology can enable for our customers</s>
<s>were going to bring that to market</s>
<s>im looking at things we didnt get done at panera my first time around as ceo</s>
<s>ive got a shot to get them done now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>look beyond the shareholder</s>
<s>were involved in the consciouscapitalism movement which is based on this idea that the worst thing that ever happened in corporate america is this obsession with shareholder value</s>
<s>its a narrow definition of success and is actually dysfunctional</s>
<s>profit and stock price are not things i can make</s>
<s>theyre a byproduct of delivering for all of my constituencies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its okay to think small</s>
<s>this idea that you have this broad strategy is not always right</s>
<s>see opportunities to make a difference and that will bring new things down the road</s>
<s>im quite convinced that steve jobs didnt know he would end up with the ipad when he did the ipod</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont obsess over the numbers</s>
<s>when i was a young person i used to be worried about the pl and then i realized that what drives the key pl is getting the right stuff done right  the key initiatives</s>
<s>thats where i began to focus most of my time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>focus on creating the future</s>
<s>the future doesnt just happen to me</s>
<s>i have to figure out where that organization is going</s>
<s>businesses are increasingly thinking short term</s>
<s>its a competitive disadvantage</s>
<s>the important things play out over years not quarters</s>
