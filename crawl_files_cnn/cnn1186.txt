<p>
<s>ireland will hold a referendum thursday on the fiscal compact that most european union leaders signed in march</s>
<s>the vote comes as spain faces new challenges in the banking sector and greece remains without an elected government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the latest polls suggest that irish voters will approve the more stringent budget rules although analysts say the outcome is far from certain given the large number of undecided voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the potential for a lastminute surprise should not be discarded said antonio barroso an analyst at political research firm eurasia group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the stakes are high for ireland which could lose access to additional bailout funds if voters reject the treaty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but a no vote in ireland would not necessarily prevent the treaty from going forward</s>
<s>the agreement needs to be ratified by 12 eurozone governments to become binding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>supporters say approving the treaty would help ensure financial stability in ireland warning that a rejection could lead to a renewed banking crisis and potentially force the nation out of the euro currency union</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>opponents argue that backing the agreement will result in additional cuts to public spending and cause economic hardship for irish citizens who have already been living with austerity for years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fiscal compact first announced in december is designed to impose discipline in government finances</s>
<s>it includes a balanced budget rule that requires governments to keep deficits below 05 of gross domestic product among other things</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>most people seem to think its better for them to stay within fiscal constraints of the compact rather than risk a renewed banking crisis in ireland said stamenkovic </s>
