<s>new york cnnmoney  spain found strong demand for its debt in a successful auction thursday two days after its treasury minister warned that the country was in danger of being shut out of markets for the cash it needs to operate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>demand was more than three times the €611 million worth of 10year bonds that spain offered up from a bidtooffer ratio of 242 in april</s>
<s>but the interest rate spain had to pay to sell the debt rose to 6044 from 5743 in april</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield for spains 10year debt edged slightly lower to 613 in trading following the auction</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>the fear is that spain will need to be bailed out if it cannot come up with a way to recapitalize the banking sector which could cost up to €100 billion by some estimates</s>
