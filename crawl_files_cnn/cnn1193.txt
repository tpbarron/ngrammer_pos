<s>hundreds of residents in coastal areas and along rivers have had to be rescued</s>
<s>and 28 louisiana parishes were without safe clean water on friday</s>

<p>
<s>the catastrophe modeling firm air worldwide said early friday they estimate the storm has caused between $700 million and $2 billion in insured losses</s>
<s>that includes residential property commercial property energy production and the interruption of business but excludes most flooding damage</s>

<p>
<s>isaacs slow forward speed and refusal to dissipate will exacerbate wind damage said tim doggett chief scientist at air</s>

<s>earlier this week another modeling firm eqecat a catastrophe modeling firm suggested onshore insured damage would run between $500 million and $15 billion</s>

<p>
<s>the longer the storm lasts the risk that more flooding damage occurs said michael kistler director of model solutions at rms another catastrophe modeling firm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because of its staying in one place a long time theres the potential for storm surge kistler said</s>
