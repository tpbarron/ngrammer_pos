<s>new york money  i resigned from my job last year</s>
<s>i still have $35000 in my companys retirement plan but i dont really understand the investments or fees</s>
<s>im thinking of transferring this money to an ira and investing it in a targetdate fund</s>
<s>my husband already has two targetdate funds one in his ira and another in his 401k</s>
<s>does this strategy make sense</s>

<p>
<s>youre hardly alone when it comes to being mystified by your company retirement plan and its fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a recent aarp study asked more than 800 401k participants whether they pay fees in their 401k plan  and 71 said they didnt think they did</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in reality of course they do</s>
<s>the financial services firms that manage 401ks charge fees for administering and managing the plans and those costs are typically picked up in whole or in part by participating employees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fact that so many 401k participants dont know that theyre footing all or some of the bill  and arent aware of the size of that tab  isnt surprising</s>
<s>information about fees is often sketchy at best</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fortunately a new rule requiring better disclosure is slated to kick in early next year</s>
<s>until then you can get a free personal 401k fee report by visiting brightscopes web site</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now lets discuss your intention to move your money into a targetdate fund within an ira</s>
<s>if youre someone who doesnt like to pick investments and monitor them a targetdate fund can be a good choice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by choosing a fund with a date that corresponds to when you plan to retire you get a fullydiversified portfolio of stocks bonds and in some cases other assets like real estate and commodities that becomes more conservative as you age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>targetdate funds take a lot of the work out of investing for retirement but you dont completely get a free pass</s>
<s>even funds geared toward people of the same age can have very different portfolios so you need to look under the hood to make sure youre comfortable with what youre getting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as i noted in a recent column thats especially true when you near or enter retirement as some target funds scale back their stock holdings much more slowly than others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a larger stock stake provides more growth potential which can be important for maintaining purchasing power throughout retirement</s>
<s>but it also makes a fund more vulnerable to market setbacks that can be unnerving when youre older</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>targetfund fees can also vary considerably from one fund family to another</s>
<s>so you want to be sure youre not overpaying</s>
<s>you can check out a target funds fees by plugging its name or ticker symbol into the quote box at morningstarcom and then clicking on the expense tab</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our money 70 list of recommended funds includes reasonablypriced target funds from two fund companies t rowe price and vanguard</s>
<s>ideally you dont want to mix and match targetdate funds from different companies as that can make it more difficult to monitor how your retirement savings are spread among different types of investments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so for the sake of simplicity you may want to put your ira dough in a target fund offered by one of the fund families your husband already invests with assuming youre okay with its investing strategy and fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if you decide on a fund that has a radically different asset mix or fees than your husbands you should review your holdings to be sure your funds complement each other and work as a coherent whole</s>
<s>you can see whether thats the case by going to morningstars instant xray tool</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when youre ready to make this move remember to tell the administrator of your workplace plan to do a direct or trusteetotrustee transfer to your ira</s>
<s>that way youll sidestep the 20 withholding requirement that would apply if the administrator just cuts you a check</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally just in case you decide to go back to work at some point youll want to roll this money into a newlycreated rollover ira rather than put it into an existing ira to which youve made annual contributions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why</s>
<s>well some workplace plans will accept ira rollovers consisting only of qualified dollars  that is funds that have come from other 401ks or similar plans</s>
<s>so opening a new ira will increase your chances of being able to transfer this money back into a future employers plan and possibly a targetdate fund in the new plan should you later decide to do soÂ </s>
