<s>much of the drop in the august unemployment rate is due to a shrinking labor force driven by so many young adults who no longer having jobs or have stopped looking for work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the drop in the unemployment rate in august isnt particularly good news for the economy  its driven mostly by nearly 400000 people dropping out of the labor force rather than more people finding jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but those dropping out arent so much the discouraged 30 40 or 50year olds</s>
<s>in fact the labor department said there was a modest decline in the overall number of discouraged job seekers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the drop is because so many young adults aged 16 to 24 are no longer looking for work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there were 453000 fewer young adults with jobs in august than in july</s>
<s>but despite that plunge only 27000 more young people were looking for new jobs</s>
<s>most apparently stopped looking and left the labor force</s>
<s>and those numbers take into account seasonal factors such as younger workers returning to school</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a result the percentage of young people who are counted in the labor force fell to its lowest level since 1955</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the unemployment rate for young adults rose to 168 from 164 in july</s>
</p>

<s>related are you better off</s>

<p>
<s>i dont think theyre more lazy</s>
<s>its that there are less opportunities for them said heidi shierholz labor economist at the economic policy institute a liberal think tank</s>
<s>they have it rough</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but how can the overall unemployment rate fall if people arent finding work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fewer job seekers can drive down the unemployment rate even if there are fewer people working because the labor department only counts those with a job or actively looking for work as in the labor force</s>
<s>if the size of the labor force declines more than the number of people who say they have jobs the unemployment rate can fall for the wrong reason</s>
<s>thats what happened in the august jobs report as the overall unemployment rate fell to 81 from 83</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related check the unemployment rate in your state</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there was some good news buried in an otherwise unsatisfying drop in the overall unemployment rate  things got a bit better for older workers the key wage earners in the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>slightly more workers in the prime 2555 year old age group had jobs in august</s>
<s>in fact the unemployment rate for that key age group fell from 72 to 71</s>
<s>and it fell for the right reason  more people finding work</s>
<s>the unemployment rate also fell for those age 55 and over</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is some modest improvement for grown ups said shierholz</s>
