<s>new york cnnmoney  businesses stepped up their hiring in july but the unemployment rate ticked higher anyway</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>employers said they added 163000 jobs in the month according to a labor department report released friday much better than the 95000 jobs economists had forecast</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but at the same time the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 83 as households claimed they lost 195000 jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the governments monthly jobs report comes from two separate surveys one that looks at employer payrolls and the other which questions households</s>
<s>those two reports went in opposite directions in july confusing the overall reading on the job market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are two sides of this report and unfortunately both sides are not telling us the same thing said ellen zentner senior us economist for nomura</s>
<s>this is a report showing the economy expanded at a greater pace in july than in june but households are still telling us theyre in pain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the household survey showed 150000 people dropped out of the job market</s>
<s>about 852000 discouraged workers were not counted in the labor force because they did not look for a job in the last four weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the so called underemployment rate rose to 15 its highest level since january</s>
<s>that includes people who are unemployed as well as those who are working parttime because they cant find fulltime jobs and those that have looked for a job sometime in the last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to the employer survey though hiring picked up at a strong pace but the quality of many of those jobs is questionable</s>
<s>some of the biggest gains were at restaurants and bars which hired 29000 workers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>auto factories also hired 12800 workers but that improvement could be misleading given seasonal adjustments that may have artificially inflated the number economists said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a temporary boost that comes in july and wont be there in august zentner said</s>
</p>

<s>were hiring across the board in all industries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>kane noted that the demand for temp workers with finance technology or health care experience in particular is so strong the firm often has trouble finding enough qualified applicants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that skills mismatch may be part of the reason households are still so discouraged she said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i think youre seeing a lot of people feeling the pain of whats going on right now kane said</s>
<s>were having this political divide blaming and fingerpointing each other about how to bring jobs back</s>
<s>the reality is were not bringing back the jobs we lost</s>
<s>the jobs of the future are new jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the education sector was a bright spot adding 19100 jobs as was health care which added 12000 jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile the public sector continues to be a drag on overall hiring</s>
<s>the government cut 9000 jobs in the month including cuts at the federal state and local levels</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the job market has a long way to go to climb out of the deep hole left by the financial crisis</s>
<s>of the 88 million jobs lost only about 4 million have been added back</s>
</p>

<p>
