<s>the issue at hand is the suitability of the investments your financial adviser steered you toward not whether the funds may have been proprietary</s>
<s>such funds sponsored by the advisers brokerage firm may generate a sizeable commission for the broker and substantial profit for his company</s>
<s>but the key to whether you have a valid complaint is whether the funds were overly aggressive when relatively conservative investments would have been more suitable for your age risk tolerance and objectives</s>

<s>proprietary funds may be appropriate for retirement</s>
<s>just because they are proprietary doesnt mean theyre not conservative and not appropriate for the investors says attorney marc d powers leader of the securities litigation  regulatory enforcement team at law firm baker hostetler</s>

<s>if you believe the investments were unsuitable you may take legal action</s>
<s>all major brokerage firms require clients to sign an arbitration clause when they open their accounts so if the firm refuses mediation your only alternative is to file an arbitration claim</s>

<s>theyll agree to mediate once they know youre serious theres an arbitration date looming and they have to pay attorneys to gear up for the hearing says securities attorney kirk smith of shepherd smith edwards  kantas</s>

<s>to avoid further broker disputes be sure you are tracking your investments on a regular basis</s>
