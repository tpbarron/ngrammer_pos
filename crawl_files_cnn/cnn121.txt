<s>immediate annuities sometimes called income or payout annuities are pretty straightforward  basically a mirror image of a life insurance policy</s>
<s>instead of paying regular premiums to an insurer that makes a lumpsum payment upon your death with an annuity you give the insurer a lump sum of cash in return for regular income payments until you die</s>
<s>actually you have several options including payments for a specified period of time  say 10 or 20 years  or payments that will continue for as long as you or your spouse is alive</s>

<s>as the name suggests immediate annuities start paying out right away so theyre are frequently used by people already in retirement</s>
<s>a deferred annuity can also be converted into an immediate annuity</s>
