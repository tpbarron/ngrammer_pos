<p>
<s>senate majority leader harry reid and house speaker john boehner reached a deal to avert the risk of a government shutdown</s>
<s>but congress wont vote on that deal until this fall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the federal reserve has made clear its standing down for now on more steps to aid the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so the job is back to congress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us economy of course faces a lot of risks</s>
<s>but one of the biggest is congress itself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and its a risk that federal reserve chairman ben bernanke has said repeatedly he cant counteract if lawmakers fail to agree on how to lessen the impact of the fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that cliff is made up of $7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts set to start taking effect 5 months from now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists have warned that letting those policies take effect in full could push the economy into a recession next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if no action were to be taken the size of the fiscal cliff is such that theres i think absolutely no chance that the federal reserve  could or would have any ability whatsoever to offset  that effect on the economy bernanke said a few months ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this month he was equally blunt noting it is not the feds role to crack the whip on lawmakers to act fiscally responsible</s>
<s>congress is in charge here he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so is congress taking charge</s>
<s>lawmakers are trying to show that theyre taking charge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>leaders from both parties have made much of two bipartisan deals reached this week that must still be approved by both chambers of congress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first is an agreement to fund the government for the first six months of fiscal year 2013 which starts in october</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this agreement reached between the senate the house and the white house provides stability for the coming months said senate majority leader harry reid on tuesday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>except that it really wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure it would prevent the threat of a government shutdown</s>
<s>but it does nothing to address any of the measures of the fiscal cliff except to establish the funding level from which the socalled sequester of spending cuts must be made</s>
<s>other than that this deal doesnt affect the sequester whatsoever said budget expert stan collender</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the measure wont be voted on until lawmakers return from summer recess in september</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then theres the bipartisan deal cut wednesday by the top democrat and republican on the senates taxwriting committee</s>
<s>that deal will extend for a year many smaller tax breaks that are set to expire or already have and it eliminates 25 of the usual tax extenders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this win shows were able to come together to tackle tough problems said sen max baucus the committee chairman</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ranking member orrin hatch described it as a first step towards  tax reform that shows that there is a path to resolving the challenges we face as a nation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but as tough problems and first steps go its not that hard or that big a leap to agree on extending many popular tax breaks and add the cost  an estimated $205 billion  to deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the meantime the house this week had a predictable partisan debate over how to extend the bush tax cuts  a major part of the fiscal cliff</s>
<s>the republicanpreferred version passed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but it will go nowhere in the senate which went through the same exercise last week</s>
<s>the senate passed the democraticpreferred version which will go nowhere in the house</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then theres the specter of the nearly $1 trillion in spending cuts  half in defense and half in nondefense  that neither party likes but which congress has yet to seriously focus on replacing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the house armed services committee on wednesday held a hearing to discuss how the obama administration will direct federal agencies to plan for the cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some of the hearing stayed on point but the rest devolved into a blame game</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first there was backandforth on who is to blame for the sequester in the first place</s>
<s>then it switched to which party is to blame for holding up a bush tax cut extension</s>
<s>and then finally conversation turned to who was to blame for turning the hearing on a very bipartisan issue into a partisan food fight</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was in short a microcosm of the endless backandforth thats been going on for more than a year in congressÂ </s>
