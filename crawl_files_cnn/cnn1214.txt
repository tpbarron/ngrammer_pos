<s>new york cnnmoney  its official</s>
<s>the first decade of the 21st century will go down in the history books as a step back for the american middle class</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last week the government made gloomy headlines when it released the latest census report showing the poverty rate rose to a 17year high</s>
<s>a whopping 462 million people or 151 of the us population live in poverty and 499 million live without health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the data also gave the first glimpse of what happened to middleclass incomes in the first decade of the millennium</s>
<s>while the earnings of middleincome americans have barely budged since the mid 1970s the new data showed that from 2000 to 2010 they actually regressed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for american households in the middle of the pay scale income fell to $49445 last year when adjusted for inflation a level not seen since 1996</s>
<s>and over the 10year period their income is down 7</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists talk about the lost decade in japan</s>
<s>well with these 2010 data we can confirm the lost decade for the american middle class said jared bernstein senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure its fair to say americans at all levels of income from rich to poor were hit hard in the decade that started with the dotcom boom and bust and ended with the great recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but according to the census data those losses disproportionately hit the lowest 60 of americans while the richest 40 actually gained wealth relative to the entire us economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>much of that trend can be explained by massive losses in the housing sector the period of high unemployment that ensued and rising prices that flew in the face of the american familys heightened financial struggles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unlike the richest americans middle class families have most of their wealth tied up in the equity of their homes which took a beating in the recession</s>
<s>and high unemployment has left many people with little or no other income at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time that americans had less cash to spend they were also being hit with rising prices for some crucial items</s>
<s>even accounting for inflation it still costs more to buy a home fill your gas tank go to the doctor and put food on the table than it did only 10 years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and not only is it more expensive to live a middleclass life it costs more to get there too</s>
<s>the price of a college education  still considered the ticket to higher wages and a better lifestyle  has surged over the last decade even in spite of the recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facing these burdens the american dream is undergoing stark changes with fewer people choosing to buy homes and more young people postponing their own independent lives</s>
<s>the census data showed about 142 of all young people ages 25 to 34 are still living in their parents homes this year compared to about 118 before the recession began in 2007</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and that poses a challenge for the economy going forward</s>
<s>after all what will the middle class and the american dream look like another decade from now if the younger generations still cant get their feet off the groundÂ </s>
