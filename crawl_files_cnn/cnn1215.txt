<s>money magazine  united states bonds are no longer officially rated triplea at least in the eyes of standard  poors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while moodys and fitch the other leading rating agencies have affirmed the top rating they too have worried about the longterm prospects for the united states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of this necessarily means disaster for your money</s>
<s>the united states has not been downgraded to junk status like say greece</s>
<s>the rating is still very high  just not tops</s>
<s>see sp downgrades us</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still there could be ripple effects</s>
<s>heres where</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bad news for the economy generally means tough times for stocks</s>
<s>but history shows that when a country loses its aaa credit rating its not necessarily terrible news for that nations stock market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when canada lost its aaa rating in april 1993 for instance the countrys stocks gained more than 15 in the subsequent year</s>
<s>the tokyo stock market climbed more than 25 in the 12 months after moodys downgraded japan in november 1998</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the very least a downgrade could add more fear and uncertainty to an already sluggish economic recovery market strategists say</s>
<s>as a result they advise investors to dial down risk in their equity portfolios by gravitating toward shares of larger stable companies  but not just any large caps</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mark luschini chief investment strategist for janney montgomery scott favors boring blue chip stocks with pristine balance sheets and that are globally diversified and therefore benefit from faster growth outside the us especially in the emerging markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why not just go directly to emerging market stocks</s>
<s>for starters usbased multinationals are a safer bet than volatile emerging market shares especially in times of economic uncertainty</s>
<s>longforgotten us multinationals are trading at much more attractive values than emerging market stocks which have been on a tear for the past decade</s>
<s>and largecap multinationals tend to pay big dividends which come in handy during periods of slow growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the year following canadas downgrade in 1993 yields on 10year canadian bonds jumped from 76 to 81</s>
<s>so the could be an uptick in us bond yields but experts didnt think it would be big</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because treasuries unlike canadian securities are considered a default investment for global investors seeking safety</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there isnt a fund that owns treasuries just because theyre rated aaa says ben inker head of asset allocation for the asset management firm gmo</s>
<s>they own treasuries because well theyre treasuries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said a downgrade would likely force investors to look at bond issuers with balance sheets unlike the uss that are improving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre a bond holder you want the most creditworthy securities says anthony valeri fixed income strategist for lpl financial</s>
<s>that would mean highquality corporate bonds and emerging market debt he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after deleveraging over the past three years us corporations are sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for emerging market countries their ratio of debttogdp is falling as the same ratio rises in the us and europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plus americans who buy emerging market debt could see their investments rise simply because emerging market currencies are strengthening against the us dollar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the relative safety of the different vehicles in which you might stash your cash  fdicinsured accounts money market funds or shortterm treasuries for example  wouldnt be so affected by a downgrade that youd need to shift your money around say experts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>skittish investors who wouldnt want to park their cash in downgraded treasuries might feel more secure by putting that money into an fdicbacked bank account instead since it would be protected by deposit insurance says fpa new income manager thomas atteberry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the increased sense of security would be little more than psychological says peter crane president of crane data which tracks the moneymarket fund industry after all like treasuries fdicinsured accounts are ultimately backed by the same entity the us government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for money market mutual funds which are not insured the effect of a downgrade is not expected to be dramatic since those funds generally invest in shortterm debt and discussion of a downgrade has so far been limited to longterm us bonds says mike krasner managing editor of imoneynetcom which monitors the money fund industry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite a downgrade us debt would still be considered a safe haven</s>
<s>double a will become the new triple a says crane because there simply isnt a viable competitor to treasuries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the price of consumer credit would be pegged less to a treasury downgrade than it would be to bond investors overall confidence says scott hoyt senior director of consumer economics for moodys analytics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for now investors seem optimistic about the future  but more cautious about the next few months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>longerterm treasuries like the benchmark 10year are in greater demand while many shorterterm bonds are seeing demand fall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because yields  and corresponding interest rates  move inversely to price rates that track shorterterm treasuries are more likely to see a bump</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rates on car loans which follow shorterterm rates like the twoyear treasury or libor the london interbank offered rate could go up  but not enough to really hit consumers says paul cuevas director of auto finance at jd</s>
<s>power  associates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most mortgage rates however track the 10year treasury yield which continues to fall</s>
<s>adjustable rate mortgage holders could be slightly more vulnerable because arms are typically tied to shorterterm interest rate movements says lawrence yun chief economist for the national association of realtors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for students and parents who rely on private student loans any jump in borrowing costs for lenders would be passed on to borrowers says mark kantrowitz publisher of finaidorg and fastwebcom</s>
<s>federal student loan rates would remain fixed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>credit card rates are pegged to the prime rate which moves with the federal funds rate</s>
<s>if the prime rate goes up consumers could be hit with credit card rate hikes says beverly blair harzog of creditcom</s>
<s>even if the rate doesnt go up she says card issuers spooked by a credit downgrade could raise your interest rates anywhere from 1 to 5  but only if youve had your card for more than a yearÂ </s>
