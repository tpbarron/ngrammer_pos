<p>
<s>i would say this will have little effect if any said jeff joerres chairman and ceo of staffing firm manpowergroup man fortune 500</s>
<s>its nice to clear one worry off the desk but there are a lot of other things to worry about</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the end of the day demand trumps all and right now demand is sluggish regardless of industry he said</s>

<s>and economists surveyed by cnnmoney forecast a gain of only 77000 jobs for july when the latest employment report is released friday</s>

<p>
<s>some economists fear that the $21 trillion in spending cuts called for in the agreement to raise the debt ceiling will slow the economy</s>
<s>the economic policy institute a liberal think tank estimates that the spending cuts will cost the economy 323000 jobs in 2012</s>
<s>it also estimates that allowing the payroll tax holiday and extended unemployment benefits to expire could cost an additional 15 million jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but most of the cuts are fairly modest</s>
