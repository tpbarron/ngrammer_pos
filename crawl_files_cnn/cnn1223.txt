<s>lawmakers need to show progress in dealing with the countrys longterm fiscal problems treasury secretary tim geithner said thursday</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>us lawmakers got another stern warning from a leading credit rating agency on thursday that there is now a very real possibility that the countrys topnotch credit rating could be downgraded in the next three months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>standard  poors said in a statement it was placing the united states sovereign rating on creditwatch with negative implications</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>owing to the dynamics of the political debate on the debt ceiling there is at least a oneintwo likelihood that we could lower the longterm rating on the us within the next 90 days the agency said in a statement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the action on thursday follows a move in april when sp changed its outlook on the us aaa rating to negative because at the time it couldnt see how lawmakers would create a path to real debt reduction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since then the political debate about the us fiscal stance and the related issue of the us government debt ceiling has in our view only become more entangled the agency said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we believe there is an increasing risk of a substantial policy stalemate enduring beyond any nearterm agreement to raise the debt ceiling sp noted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed other warnings from ratings agencies moodys and fitch in the interim spurred more rhetoric than action from politicians</s>
<s>seven weeks worth of talks between the parties led by vice president joe biden broke down in june after house majority leader eric cantor left the negotiations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and regular meetings at the white house between president obama and capitol hill brass over the past two weeks have showed no signs of real progress</s>
<s>obama will hold a press conference friday to offer an update on the negotiations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a downgrade of us credit would mean interest rates on us bonds would go up</s>
<s>and it could have ramifications across global markets because us bonds are considered the worlds safe haven investment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the treasury issued an immediate response to the news</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>todays action by sp restates what the obama administration has said for some time that congress must act expeditiously to avoid defaulting on the countrys obligations and to enact a credible deficit reduction plan that commands bipartisan support treasury official jeffrey goldstein said</s>
<s>read republican stance on taxes a bust with public</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a downgrade could come for one of three reasons sp explained</s>
</p>

<p>
<s> if congress and the administration fail to come up with a credible solution to us debt and show no signs of agreeing on one in the foreseeable future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s> if the united states misses any scheduled debt service payments in which case sp would issue a selective default meaning a default has occurred on some bonds but not others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s> if sp concludes that the debt ceiling debate so bogs down that it calls into question policymakers willingness and ability to timely honor the us scheduled debt obligations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>treasury started sending letters to congress back in january urging them to raise the $143 trillion debt ceiling  which is the us legal borrowing limit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the treasury takes in on average about $125 billion less than it has to pay out on a monthly basis</s>
<s>to make up the difference it issues us bonds and because of the countrys sterling rating it is able to do so at very low rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if congress doesnt raise the debt ceiling by aug 2 the treasury will no longer be able to pay all of the countrys bills in full and on time without interruptionÂ </s>
