<s>a lot of people think that the middle was hollowed out and disappearing said tony carnevale director of the center on education and the workforce at georgetown</s>
<s>but its actually much healthier than we thought</s>

<s>the most popular certificates for people with just a high school diploma include certified nursing assistant commercial truck driver fork lift operator and insurance agent the study said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for those with an associate degree popular certificates include licensed practical nurse paralegal and certified coding specialist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even in todays depressed job market at least a million jobs for people with these and similar qualifications are currently unfilled said carnevale</s>

<p>
