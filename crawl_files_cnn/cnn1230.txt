<s>new york cnnmoney  when it comes to taxes do the rich pay their fair share</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the answer of course is subjective since fair is not an absolute concept and tax data depending how its sliced can tell different stories</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those who say the rich pay their fair share point to the fact that the top 1 of taxpayers end up paying almost as much in federal income tax and some years even more as the bottom 95 combined</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still its unlikely that even the most antitax prowealth advocates would find this particularly fair a very small number of millionaires end up owing no federal income tax at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre in good company of course</s>
<s>nearly half of all us households or 69 million are estimated to have owed no federal income taxes for 2010</s>
<s>the vast majority of them however are low income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but 18000 were households taking in more than $500000  and of those 4000 made more than $1 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how can it be that those with big income streams owed zip to uncle sam</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>janice johnson and jay safier members of the new york state society of certified public accountants and roberton williams a senior fellow at the tax policy center explained the likely reasons</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such tax filers probably have big portfolios and big investment losses from the 2008 financial crisis</s>
<s>they are also more likely to be retired or selfemployed and may be charitably inclined</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats common to all is that they likely qualify for the many tax breaks in the code that disproportionately benefit highincome households</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a lot of these are people who probably made it very big on wall street years ago and who turned around and put it all in taxexempt bonds johnson said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many of her clients are in their 50s or older and theyre very leery of equity markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>williams offered a hypothetical example a retired person with $10 million invested in municipal bonds paying 5 interest or $500000 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because there is no limit on how much taxexempt interest you can earn without having to pay taxes she pays nothing to the federal government he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or its possible that some of these tax filers have a large portfolio and booked a lot of taxable gains in the recent runup in stocks</s>
<s>but they were able to fully offset those gains with the many capital losses they realized during the financial crisis which made even the most experienced investor want to take their marbles and go home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another possibility a tax filer has a yen for foreign investments</s>
<s>say he owns a dividendpaying foreign stock such as bp johnson said</s>
<s>the british government will withhold tax on the dividends that bp pays</s>
<s>to avoid being taxed twice on the dividend the investor may be able to claim a foreign tax credit on her us income tax return for the amount withheld</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as long as the foreign tax exceeds her us tax liability on that dividend she will pay nothing on her federal tax return williams said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>johnson is also seeing a lot of people today who have left their jobs to start a business or become a consultant</s>
<s>their selfemployed paycheck  not including income from their investments  is far lower than their paychecks when they worked for the man</s>
<s>and the tax owed on their new salary is more than offset by their mortgage interest and real estate tax deductions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>safier noted there is another way such highincome households might substantially reduce their federal tax bite giving to charity in a big way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he noted two strategies</s>
<s>the first involves selling property to a charity below market value</s>
<s>that lets the seller treat a portion of the sale as a charitable contribution</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second involves donating highly appreciated stocks to a charity</s>
<s>the tax filer can deduct the fair market value of the donated shares as a contribution without having to pay any capital gains</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at a time of record deficits its not unreasonable to say the rich should pay more when the law allows even 1 of millionaires to owe nothing in federal income tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but keep in mind that boosting taxes on the rich by itself wont come close to solving the countrys fiscal problems for a number of reasons</s>
<s>most notably there simply arent enough of themÂ </s>
