<s>coffee makers across the country are doing the same as they struggle to absorb the surging cost of green coffee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>green coffee is used to make the different blends of coffee you buy at cafes or grocery stores and poor growing conditions in south america and other coffeegrowing countries have led to fears of an imminent supply crunch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those supply fears have also caused coffee futures to soar</s>
