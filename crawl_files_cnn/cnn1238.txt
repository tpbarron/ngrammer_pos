<p>
<s>goodbye aaa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  credit rating agency standard and poors made good on its saberrattling on friday and downgraded us debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the move is unprecedented  and the effects unclear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so what exactly is going on here</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rating agencies  sp moodys and fitch  analyze risk and give debt a grade that reflects the borrowers ability to pay the underlying loans</s>
<s>the safest bets are stamped aaa</s>
<s>thats where us debt has stood for years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moodys first assigned the united states a aaa rating in 1917</s>
<s>the countrys new sp rating is aa  still strong but not the highest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the downgrade puts the us debt rating on par with that of belgium but below countries like the united kingdom and australia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why did this happen now</s>
<s>sp gave two primary reasons for downgrading us debt the nations fiscal path and its broken political system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the agency has been harping on those two issues for months</s>
<s>sp argues that the us debttogdp trajectory is unsustainable and that the politics involved are so caustic that lawmakers are unable to make the tough choices needed to correct the problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>during the debt ceiling debate lawmakers blew their big chance to make a difference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to avoid a downgrade sp said the united states needed to not only raise the debt ceiling but also develop a credible plan to tackle the nations longterm debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the agency has indicated it preferred a deal that would have reduced deficits by $4 trillion over ten years</s>
<s>instead lawmakers settled for a measure that will cut only $25 trillion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what does a downgrade mean for my finances</s>
<s>well its tough to say</s>
<s>remember this has never happened before to the united states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and it doesnt necessarily mean disaster for your money</s>
<s>the united states has not been downgraded to junk status like say greece</s>
<s>the rating is still very high  just not tops</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line  its not going to help matters especially with the economy already in a soft patch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some reaction is expected in the stock market</s>
<s>major indexes around the world were battered last week and a downgrade can only increase uncertainty and fear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its unclear how the treasury market will react</s>
<s>some experts think yields could spike  and that could impact consumers by leading to rate hikes on items like car loans mortgages and student loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but others predict investors will shrug off the downgrade</s>
<s>why</s>
<s>because the us fiscal situation is well known and sp is not basing its rating on any information that is not already available</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>can the us return to a aaa rating</s>
<s>it can</s>
<s>but it will be tough and it wont happen for a while</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>john chambers the head of sovereign ratings at sp told cnn that his agencys decision is likely to have a longterm impact</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once you lose your aaa it doesnt usually bounce back he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its unclear exactly what steps are needed to change sps mind</s>
<s>a source familiar with the discussion said friday evening that the rating agency had not discussed a return to aaa status with the treasury department</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>was this avoidable</s>
<s>yes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sp has gone out of its way to point to the political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling as a key reason for the downgrade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that puts the blame squarely on lawmakers  and the political culture they cultivate and participate in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first thing lawmakers could have done is to have raised the debt ceilng in a timely manner so that much of this debate had been avoided to begin with as it had done 60 or 70 times since 1960 without that much debate chambers said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is one party to blame over the other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a problem thats been a long time in the making chambers said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a sign that message had not been received lawmakers and candidates for political office issued a slew of partisan statements friday night casting blame and throwing rhetorical stones just hours after the downgrade was announcedÂ </s>
