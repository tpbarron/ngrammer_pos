<s>us money market funds have cut their holdings of eurozone bank debt by onethird since may 2011</s>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  after three years of rapidly unwinding holdings in banks that share the euro currency us money market funds have dipped back in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these funds increased their holdings by 15 since the end of december according to a fitch report released thursday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most of that increase stems from money markets adding to their positions in french banks according to fitch which looked at roughly 45 of the $14 trillion managed by us money market funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even with the 15 increase us money market funds are still holding 65 less eurozone bank debt than they did nine months ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the funds now hold roughly 11 of their assets in eurozone banks compared with 31 at the end of may 2011</s>
<s>thats about onethird of the historical average</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fund managers are putting their toes back in the water but very conservatively said alex roever managing director and senior credit strategist at jpmorgan chase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in its report fitch warns that this modest turnaround might actually represent a new equilibrium in which us money market funds remain more cautious than optimistic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>additionally the drop in us money market funding has forced many banks in eurozone countries to scramble for alternative sources of financing and also cut back on businesses dependent on us dollars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and thats a trend that may continue said fitch</s>
<s>so even if money market funds regain a hearty appetitive for eurozone debt the banks may not be willing participants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jpmorgans roever said that he expects that us money market funds will likely wait to see if ratings firm moodys downgrades any of the eurozone banks it placed on review before investing more significantly in the eurozone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moodys placed bnp paribas deutsche bank db societe generale and 14 other banks on review last week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the report notes that 27 of money market funds exposure to european banks is in the form of socalled repurchase agreements or repos</s>
<s>with repos the banks selling them have agreed to buy back their own securities at a later date</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money market funds are continuing to flee for the safety of us treasuries with about 19 of their cash in lowyielding governmentbacked bonds</s>
<s>thats above historical averages</s>
