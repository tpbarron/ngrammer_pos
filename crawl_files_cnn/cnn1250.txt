<p>
<s>as long as you owned the land for investment purposes you can offset capital gains in this case from the sale of property with capital losses from stock sales</s>
<s>for instance if you sold the property for a $10000 profit and took a $5000 loss on stocks the amount subject to capital gains tax would be reduced to $5000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if your net capital losses are greater than your capital gains you can also deduct the capital loss against ordinary income up to a limit of $3000 a year according to edward gormley ceo of susquehanna financial advisors in mechanicsburg pa</s>
<s>if your capital loss is greater than $3000 the excess carries over to the following year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in order to qualify as longterm capital gains or losses you need to have owned the asset for a year or more</s>
<s>if youve held them for less time than that the federal government considers them shortterm capital assets and taxes any gains at ordinary income tax rates instead of the 15 rate on longterm capital gains</s>
