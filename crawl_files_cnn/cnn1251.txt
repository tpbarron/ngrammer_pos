<p>
<s>these are just some of the green benefits from money spent under 2009s $787 billion stimulus package</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>muro noted the declining price for wind and solar electricity and said in some markets its already competitive with fossil fuels</s>
<s>he said this onetime jolt of stimulus cash is needed in a sector such as energy where the size and costs of projects make it hard for new technologies to emerge while old technologies enjoy the benefits of decades of previous government support</s>

<p>
<s>muro thinks renewables like wind and solar will soon be able to compete on their own and the stimulus will have played a big part in that</s>
