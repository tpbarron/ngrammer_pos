<s>new york cnnmoney  the drought thats drying up the heartland isnt just an american problem</s>
<s>its causing food prices to surge worldwide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and it could get worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is not some gentle monthly wakeup call its the same global alarm thats been screaming at us since 2008 said colin roche of oxfam noting that the drought could lead to food shortages for millions of people worldwide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>food is a major us export so the drought affects prices around the globe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>world leaders must snap out of their lazy complacency and realize the time of cheap food has long gone roche said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in july food prices jumped 6 after three months of declines according to the united nations monthly food price index released thursday</s>
<s>the main drivers behind the increase</s>
<s>grain prices</s>
<s>and more specifically corn prices which have hit record highs in recent weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to the un report global corn prices surged nearly 23 in july exacerbated by the severe deterioration of maize crop prospects in the united states following drought conditions and excessive heat during critical stages of the crop development</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its going to have a big impact on consumers said sam zippin an analyst at financial information firm sageworks</s>
<s>corn is in almost everything</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>food prices have been creeping up throughout the united states as hot temperatures across the midwestern and western parts of the nation have dried out crops and driven up the price of corn and grain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the un index of cereal prices soared 17 last month creeping closer to its alltime high set in april 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paul mcnamara associate professor at the university of illinois college of agriculture said grain prices could rise still further as cattle ranchers look for a substitute to corn the most expensive feed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meat prices actually declined modestly according to the un report but that was partly due to ranchers culling their herds to curb prices they have to pay for cornbased feed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mcnamara said the increases in corn prices and the weak harvest will also put pressure on policymakers to change the current us policy towards ethanol which mandates that nearly 10 of the nations fuel supply comes from corn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>aside from corn some of the most dramatic increases in foodflation were in the fats and oils because they use soybeans which have also been hurt by the drought</s>
<s>and that translates into higher prices for margarine and peanut butter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the uns price index of oils and fats notched up 2 in july</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and the price of sugar  another household staple  spiked 12 in july though the us drought wasnt to blame</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the upturn was triggered by untimely rains in brazil the worlds largest sugar exporter which hampered sugarcane harvesting in july said the un concerns over delayed monsoon in india and poor precipitation in australia also contributed to the price increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats next</s>
<s>expect meat prices to move higher into next year as ranchers get their cattle inventories to manageable levels</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you might have some extra supply this year as people liquidate their herds said mcnamara</s>
<s>but youre going to have a year from now tighter supplies as people reduce their herds in the us</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>going forward the severity of food inflation depends on how long the drought in the united states lasts as well as the weather conditions in major foodproducing countries like india and russia said david hallam director of trade and markets for the uns food and agriculture organization</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hallam said the world food supply isnt as lean as it was during the international food crisis of 2007 and 2008 because even though corn prices are prohibitively expensive consumers have other foods to fall back on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if countries start unilaterally panic buying or restricting exports that could make a bad problem worse said hallam</s>
<s>the situation right now is one of heightened vulnerability to any future shocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consumers will get a better idea of where prices are headed friday when the us department of agriculture releases its world agricultural supply and demand estimates which forecasts supply and demand for crops and livestock around the world</s>
