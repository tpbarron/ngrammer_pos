<s>this seems minor to me unless they hacked my credit card numbers or my banking information</s>

<p>
<s>sonys letter to congress pointed out that the company recently landed in anonymous crosshairs for suing two people who were distributing instructions on how to hack a playstation 3 game system  and then going after identifying details on anyone who ever viewed the instructions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a purported anonymous news site anonnewsorg posted a statement on april 22 titled for once we didnt do it</s>
<s> but the poster did acknowledge that since anonymous is a decentralized group it could be the case that other anons have acted by themselves  though the group does not take responsibility as a whole for whatever has happened</s>
