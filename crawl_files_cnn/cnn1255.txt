<s>if you are uncomfortable carrying a mortgage into retirement ask yourself whether you are in a position to pay down the mortgage while you are still working</s>
<s>you might be better off accelerating payment on the mortgage now rather than drawing on your 401k later says tom fisher owner of fisher financial strategies in cambridge mass</s>
<s>this might mean refinancing to take advantage of record low interest rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you wait and pay the $100000 balance using 401k assets youll have to withdraw more than the $100000 balance in order to cover the income taxes on your withdrawal</s>
<s>fisher also points out that the assets in your 401k are benefiting from taxdeferred growth</s>
<s>pulling more than $100000 out of your savings so early in retirement means youll lose out on the potential for decades worth of taxdeferred compound growth</s>

<p>
<s>instead directing more funds to paying off your mortgage now with low interest rates and an accelerated payment plan means you may be able to pay down all or most of the debt before you retire</s>
<s>however if you are comfortable budgeting for mortgage payments past retirement you can refinance for a longer period</s>
