<s>good news your employers matching contribution does not count toward the $17000 cap so you could end up with more than $17000 in yearly contributions if you defer enough to get the full match</s>
<s>once you reach age 50 you may also make an additional $5500 in contributions per year says constance stone a financial planner in chagrin falls oh</s>

<s>the roth ira is a separate animal as well but there are qualifications</s>
<s>as long as your joint modified adjusted gross income is below $173000 in 2012 you can each contribute $5000 to a roth ira in addition to your employersponsored plans says jay hutchins a financial planner in lebanon nh</s>
<s>between $173000 and $183000 the amount you can contribute is reduced and if you make $183000 or more you cannot put money in a roth</s>

<p>
<s>putting money into both a 401k and a roth is a smart tax move if you can do it</s>
<s>if you save all of your retirement money into taxdeferred accounts such as your 401k youll have fewer options in retirement since youll have to pay taxes on every penny you withdraw</s>
