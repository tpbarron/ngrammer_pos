<s>we own three rental properties outright but have not been depreciating them for tax purposes</s>
<s>an accountant tells us that irs rules say we must take the depreciation</s>
<s>is this true</s>

<p>
<s>the short answer is yes you must take the depreciation</s>
<s>start by filing irs form 3115 to deduct previously unclaimed depreciation with your tax return</s>
<s>i dont recommend waiting says janet hagy a cpa at hagy  associates in austin tex</s>
<s>she explains that any delay can leave you vulnerable to an irs audit or potential rule changes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>filing takes some time but hagy says the process isnt difficult — and should result in a lower tax liability</s>
<s>when you claim depreciation for the first time youll need to compute how much you should have been claiming each year starting with the first year you rented each property</s>
<s>going forward you will need to calculate the depreciation over the remaining useful life of the building</s>
<s>the irs defines a buildings useful life as 27 ½ years for residential properties and 39 years for commercial properties beginning when the property was first placed in service</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if real estate is your primary business your depreciation losses are fully deductible against all income</s>
<s>if not your losses are known as passive and you can only deduct up to $25000 against any income from the rentals</s>
<s>losses of more than $25000 can be carried over to the next year but the deductions phase out if your modified adjusted gross income is between $100000 and $150000 for both individuals and those who are married filing jointly</s>
<s>for more details check out irs publication 527</s>
