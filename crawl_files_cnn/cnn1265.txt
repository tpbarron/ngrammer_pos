<s>demonstrators stand in front of greek parliament in athens during a protest on wednesday against plans for new austerity measures</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  deficit hawks often cite greeces debt nightmare as a cautionary tale for the united states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but is the united states really like greece</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the differences between the countries after all give the united states some builtin advantages when it comes to managing its debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us economy</s>
<s>gargantuan</s>
<s>greeces economy</s>
<s>tiny</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plus the united states earning capacity is greater since it has a more diverse economy than greece does said barry anderson who used to run a budgeting and public expenditures division at the organization for economic cooperation and development</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are also big differences in the countries currencies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dollar is the worlds reserve currency and is managed by a single government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the euro by contrast is used by 17 sovereign countries</s>
<s>therefore greeces monetary policy is set not according to greeces needs but by the needs of stronger economies  especially germany  that prefer higher interest rates as a bulwark against inflation</s>
<s>see correction below</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the oecd meanwhile estimates that us net debt will reach 75 of the countrys economy this year</s>
<s>that number includes federal state and local debt but excludes debt owed to government trust funds such as social security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>greeces debt by contrast will be around 125</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so whats the concern for the united states exactly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the real fundamental similarity is trend</s>
<s>both countries fiscal situations are bad and getting worse anderson said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because both the united states and greece have aging populations and mature economies that arent likely to grow as much as they have in the past</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>simply assuming that the united states will remain forever immune from the perils of too much debt is not a winning strategy deficit hawks warn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course thats a hard case to make when investors embrace treasuries every time they get spooked by turmoil in europe</s>
<s>events in greece in recent days have driven the 10year treasury yield below 3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words the united states continues to get the benefit of being a safe haven compared to the rest of the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but experts believe that investors wont always give americans the benefit of the doubt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the markets do react late but when they react they react pretty sharply said carlos cottarelli director of fiscal affairs at the international monetary fund during a committee for a responsible federal budget conference this week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a little over a year ago investors fears that greece would ever default were considerably lower than they are today</s>
<s>so its not surprising that the yield on 10year greek bonds is now pushing 18 up from 6 at the start of 2010 according to bloomberg markets data</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even if us rates dont rise soon  and some say they wont because investors fear slower economic growth  that doesnt mean markets cant find other ways to hurt the united states anderson said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors might choose to punish the dollar if they start to believe congress doesnt have the political will to do whats required to put the us budget on a more sustainable track</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and a substantially weaker dollar would have all sorts of negative repercussions including a possible credit downgrade from ratings agencies said michael pond managing director of fixed income strategy at barclays capital at the crfb conference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bottom line the us is not greece in many ways</s>
<s>but its also not immune from the punishing effects of debt</s>
