<s>hong kong cnnmoney  president obama and mitt romney were sharply critical of chinas trade practices in their final debate while underscoring the opportunity for the us in a fair partnership with beijing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both candidates said that china has great potential as a trading partner but expressed worry over beijings actions</s>
<s>obama touted the number of trade cases he has brought against china while romney pledged to designate the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time both also offered conciliatory language saying that the relationship between the worlds two largest economic powers could flourish if china adheres to international standards</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they have to understand we want to trade with them romney said</s>
<s>we want a world thats stable</s>
<s>we like free enterprise but you got to play by the rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mixed messages were underscored by a puzzling exchange in which obama described china as an adversary only to be contradicted by romney who until the final debate had been the more hawkish of the two candidates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china is both an adversary but also a potential partner in the international community if its following the rules obama said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney responded we dont have to be an adversary in any way shape or form</s>
<s>we can work with them we can collaborate with them if theyre willing to be responsible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the obama campaign did not immediately respond when asked to explain the presidents phrasing but the comment does run counter to the general trend in sinous relations the tone of which has been largely positive over the past four years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the remark also contradicts comments made by secretary of state hillary clinton early in the obama presidency</s>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<s>rather than argue over who is going to be tougher on china dealing with our fiscal challenges and strengthening our competitive profile is a better approach he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romneys vow to label china a currency manipulator is largely a symbolic gesture</s>
<s>the move could trigger talks with china but no immediate punitive actions are attached to the designation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists are more worried about the second part of romneys plan which is to direct the department of commerce to institute countervailing duties if china does not quickly move to float its currency</s>
