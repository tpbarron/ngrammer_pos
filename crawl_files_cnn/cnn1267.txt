</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  shopping for a used car</s>
<s>buying a certified preowned car can certainly give you some peace of mind</s>
<s>but just because its certified doesnt mean its problemfree</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here are five things you need to know before walking onto the used car lot</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>certification can offer peace of mind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sales of certified preowned cpo autos have risen 35 since 2002 while used car sales overall fell 10 per edmundscom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>quality assurance is a big selling point cpos are one to fiveyearold cars that have been inspected fixed up and newly warrantied</s>
<s>theyre priced $750 to $3000 above noncertified models</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if you dont want the hassle of dealing with repairs its worth the added cost says edmunds analyst jessica caldwell</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>but not all programs offer the same protection</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cpos that are factorycertified are backed by the manufacturer and undergo a 100plus point inspection</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dealercertified cars usually arent inspected as rigorously says alec gutierrez of kelley blue book</s>
<s>and if the vehicle needs repairs it has to be taken to that dealership</s>
<s> while it may cost you several hundred more factorycertified is a better deal he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>doing some of your own homework can pay off</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even factorycertified vehicles arent necessarily problemfree says consumer protection lawyer daniel blinn who reports seeing an increase in cpo complaints</s>
<s>he suggests reviewing service records carefully</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and since accident repairs paid for without insurance dont always show up on carfax reports get an independent inspection about $100</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>4</s>
<s>the savings over a new car may not be as large as you expect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>owing to high demand in the last year used autos are retaining more value than ever</s>
<s>and to push sales dealers are saving the best financing for new cars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the result</s>
<s>a 2009 certified nissan versa purchased with a fiveyear loan is only $26 a month cheaper than a 2012 model edmunds found</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before choosing a cpo use an online calculator to see how the payments stack up against todays version</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>5</s>
<s>dealers wont start with their best rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an outside source of financing will usually offer you a better rate says edmunds analyst joe spina</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>recently for example nissan dealers in la advertised 394 on fiveyear cpo loans while pentagon federal credit union offered 199 for all cars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>get preapproved for the best apr you can then see if the dealer  who makes money on financing  will beat it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dealer wont budge</s>
<s>press for money off the car price if you take their loan</s>
</p>
