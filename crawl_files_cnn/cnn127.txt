<s>new york cnnmoney  the economy added 103000 new jobs in september</s>
<s>thats great news for the obama campaign right</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not exactly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres the problem 103000 new jobs a month is still about 50000 jobs off the pace economists say is needed just to keep pace with population growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the unemployment rate stands at 91</s>
<s>its been half a year since the economy added more than 150000 jobs in any one month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and the problems driving unemployment  slow growth and a crippled housing market  remain a policy puzzle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a trend that should be setting off alarm bells at obamas 2012 campaign headquarters</s>
<s>after one full term it will be difficult to blame the previous republican regime for the lackluster economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>right now we are the ones in charge vice president joe biden said in september</s>
<s>and the economy has gotten better</s>
<s>but it hasnt gotten good enough</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barring an economic miracle obama will likely enter the heart of the campaign season with unemployment north of 8</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the congressional budget office estimates the unemployment rate will fall to 89 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and to 85 in the fourth quarter of 2012</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the anecdotal evidence is lined up firmly against obama</s>
<s>no president since franklin d roosevelt has won reelection with an unemployment rate over 72</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but thats just one data point</s>
<s>according to political scientists and election watchers a more useful predictor of electoral success is how the public feels about the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words a series of positive reports and robust economic expansion in the months leading up to the election might give obama the wiggle room he needs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the economy will have to actually improve</s>
<s>right now the public is downright pessimistic</s>
<s>a recent cnnorc international poll shows 90 of those polled believe current economic conditions are poor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>setting aside public sentiment there is also a very real threat that economic conditions could deteriorate further</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to a forecast from the economic cycle research institute the economy is staring down another recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ecri produces widelyfollowed leading indicators that predict when the economy is moving between recession and expansion  and all those indicators are now pointing to a new economic downturn in the immediate future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>congress could lend the president a hand and pass measures designed to stimulate the economy</s>
<s>but that seems unlikely</s>
<s>obamas stimulus proposal  the american jobs act  is all but dead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the house will not hold a vote on the bill</s>
<s>in the senate it appears democrats are having trouble getting enough votes to muscle the measure through</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the inability of congress to pass a bill  any bill  might actually become an obama campaign theme</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>asked during thursdays news conference if he was trying to run against a donothing congress obama said if congress does something then i cant run against a donothing congress</s>
