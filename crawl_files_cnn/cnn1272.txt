</p>

<p>
<s>gross domestic product the broadest measure of the nations economy grew at a 22 annual rate in the first three months of 2012 the commerce department said friday down from a 3 growth rate in the prior quarter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>growth at that rate is considered too weak to lead to the hiring needed to put millions of unemployed americans back to work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the data was also lower than the 25 rate economists had been expecting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first quarter was largely characterized by consistently stronger retail sales but otherwise fickle economic data</s>

<p>
<s>meanwhile consumer spending increased 29</s>
<s>spending was particularly robust on long lasting items like autos with durable goods spending rising 153 in the quarter</s>

<s>the fluctuation in the data however has led many economists to believe the mild winter gave the economy only a temporary boost at the beginning of the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example auto sales may have been unusually strong in january and february simply because of warmer temperatures</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>even the federal reserve is erring on the side of caution given mixed economic data lately</s>
<s>in a press conference earlier this week fed chairman ben bernanke said the fiscal cliff poses significant risk to the recovery</s>
</p>
