<s>im married and have a 401k and an ira</s>
<s>my house and bank account are listed as living trusts</s>
<s>should the beneficiary for the 401k and ira be my wife or the trust</s>

<p>
<s>the right choice will depend in part on how long you want those assets to keep benefiting from taxdeferred growth</s>
<s>naming your wife as a direct beneficiary means that she can roll those assets into her own retirement accounts through what the irs calls a spousal rollover</s>
<s>those funds can keep growing taxdeferred until she has to begin taking required minimum distributions at age 70 12</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you leave your 401k and ira to the trust and name your wife as a beneficiary to the trust she will have to start taking required minimum distributions by the end of the year following your death</s>
<s>those distributions would be based on her life expectancy</s>

<s>naming your wife as the beneficiary of both retirement accounts is really the cleaner option of the two says jim brogan president of knoxville tennbased brogan financial</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said you may consider leaving your 401k and ira to a trust if you want more control over how those funds are distributed to your heirs</s>
<s>for example if you want to make sure that your children from a previous marriage get some of your retirement savings as an inheritance a trust can allow you to specify how to split up those assets</s>
<s>if you leave the money outright to your wife brogan says she can name any beneficiaries she wants</s>
