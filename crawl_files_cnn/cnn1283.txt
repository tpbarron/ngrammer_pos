<s>if some of the worlds largest corporations cant manage to keep your personal and financial data safe is there anything you can do to protect yourself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a recent string of cyber attacks on companies such as sony citigroup and nasdaq — organizations youd hope would know something about data security — has spotlighted the vulnerability of personal information that could be used to steal your identity</s>
<s>the latest breach of customer privacy came a week ago when gaming company sega admitted that the email addresses dates of birth and encrypted passwords of nearly 13 million customers had been compromised</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the frequency and scope of these successful attacks is shocking</s>
<s>this year alone more than 13 million records have been involved in security breaches related to hacking or malware according to nonprofit consumer group privacy rights clearinghouse</s>
<s>and thats only from 58 such incidents that were made public</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one possible solution is stronger legislation</s>
<s>earlier this month sen patrick leahy dvt reintroduced the personal data privacy and security act for the fourth time since 2005</s>
<s>the bill which requires companies to strengthen protections and imposes stricter penalties on hackers would supersede a patchwork of state data breach laws</s>
<s>the bill also makes it a crime to conceal a security breach unless the compromised information poses no significant risk of harm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the recent spate of highprofile data breaches may provide political momentum to leahys bill</s>
<s>but strengthening protection of sensitive information requires a technical fix not just punitive measures says lauren weinstein cofounder of people for internet responsibility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>evidence for that says weinstein can be found in mays citigroup hack</s>
<s>on june 15 the company announced that its credit card breach affected more than 360000 customer accounts a significantly larger figure than previously stated</s>
<s>according to the new york times hackers exploited a simple loophole to access financial data logging on to citis credit card customer site and plugging different numbers into the web browsers address bar giving them access to other accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they did it by using the oldest trick in the book weinstein said</s>
<s>thats the kind of problem we were seeing in the very early days of web commerce and for something like that to show up now is depressing</s>
<s>i dont think you can legislate away that mistake</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so what can you do to minimize the damage of a data breach that depends on what information is stolen says paul stephens director of policy and advocacy with the privacy rights clearinghouse</s>
<s>heres his advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>social security numbers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if your social security number has been exposed says stephens you should check your credit reports regularly and place a fraud alert — or perhaps a security freeze — on your credit report</s>
<s>start at annualcreditreportcom the official site to get a free credit report from each of the countrys major consumer credit reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion</s>
<s>each offers one free credit report every 12 months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fraud alerts notify potential credit grantors that you may be a victim of identity theft so that theyll tread more carefully when setting up a new financial account</s>
<s>a call to just one of the credit reporting companies will help you set up a fraud alert with all three for at least 90 days</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a security freeze can lock your credit report to prevent potential identity thieves from opening any new accounts</s>
<s>each company — and state — has its own policies regarding setting up and removing freezes but the process is usually free if youre a victim of identity theft</s>
<s>consumers union offers a comprehensive list of policies</s>
<s> keep in mind that taking these steps could also make your own applications for new credit more difficult</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>financial account information</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if information about your debit or credit card is stolen you should immediately cancel the account says stephens and carefully monitor your financial statements to make sure your information is not being misused</s>
<s>this is particularly true if its information about your debit card he says since it offers consumers fewer protections against misuse a debit card is a direct pipeline to your checking accounthe says</s>
<s>the money is almost immediately drawn from your account and youll have to fight with your bank to get it back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>email addresses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>compared to a compromised credit card number or social security number an exposed email address may seem innocuous</s>
<s>but when your email or other account details are compromised stephens says you should be on the lookout for spear phishing targeted email that poses as a legitimate message to solicit even more information</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unless youre 100 percent certain that an email is legitimate our advice is when you receive an email asking for any information dont respond to it he says</s>
<s>instead if it appears to be an email coming from your bank or credit card company give the company a call or pay a visit to the official website</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for protecting yourself in advance the most important thing you can do is use different passwords for every account since hackers who have your password for one website can easily test to see whether it works with similar usernames on other websites</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately nothing is foolproof</s>
<s>the only way you can limit your exposure is to never give your information out to anybody — and youd have to live on a deserted island to do that stephens says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>find money on facebook</s>
<s>follow money on twitter</s>
