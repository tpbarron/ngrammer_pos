<s>john and marlit stubb 46 and 48 with kids anneliese and reagan of kirkland wash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  the recession dealt the stubb family a double blow in late 2008 john lost his job in ad sales</s>
<s>marlit an auto industry performance manager was laid off in early 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while john found a new gig quickly marlit was out of work for two full years</s>
<s>going from a combined income of $230000 to $90000 we cut everything we could  vacations dinners out and saving for retirement he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>doing so they just covered their $6000 monthly expenses out of income</s>
<s>so when marlit was hired by chrysler last february bringing their income to $185000 they found themselves with a monthly surplus of $2000 even after restoring retirement savings meals out and home repairs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what to do with that cash has been a source of debate</s>
<s>john wants to save more for retirement</s>
<s>marlit wants to speed up payment of their mortgage</s>
<s>theyd both like to bolster college funds for children reagan and anneliese ages 11 and 14</s>
<s>seattle financial planner michelle fait offers a compromise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>three fixes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>get real about retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the stubbs would like to quit in 12 years when marlit is 60 john is 58 and the kids are out of college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre now saving $11250 a year in johns 401k  he gets a $2100 match  and $10000 in roth iras</s>
<s>at a 6 average annual return theyll have $14 million by 2023</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that wont sustain their lifestyle for 35 years fait says</s>
<s>but if they delay five years and john ups his 401k savings to $16500 an extra $437 pretax per month theyll have $25 million which should do the trick</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pump up the cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>marlit wants the mortgage paid off because shes worried that if she loses her job again they could lose their house</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fait says that is unlikely given how well they navigated the last layoff</s>
<s>so rather than having them tie up money in an illiquid asset she suggests increasing cash reserves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>saving $1500 a month gets them to $70000 nine months of current expenses in 18 months</s>
<s>this takes some anxiety off the table and gives them flexibility says fait</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>send the help desk your questions about family financial planning</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fund college wisely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>john and marlit want to foot at least half their kids tuition but have only $31000 saved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after shoring up cash they can redirect part of the $1500 to college savings accounts part to a taxable account</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this will allow them to use some of the money for retirement if the kids choose public universities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also by annelieses freshman year they can spend down their reserves to six months of costs since theyll be close to paying off their mortgage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>total assets $1229000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>total liabilities $135000</s>
