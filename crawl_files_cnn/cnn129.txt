<s>new york cnnmoney  congress has invented a new extreme sport skating on the edge of a $7 trillion fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the magnitude of tax increases and spending cuts that will start to hit the economy on jan 1 2013 unless congress acts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and how congress navigates that fiscal cliff will affect economic growth americans wallets and the countrys fiscal outlook</s>
<s>fiscal cliff what should congress do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is about $7 trillion there that  could be taken out of the economy in a really stupid way that would likely push us into a recession immediately said maya macguineas president of the committee for a responsible federal budget</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed economist mark zandi estimates that inaction by congress could chop 3 percentage points off inflationadjusted economic growth in 2013</s>
<s>in that scenario he estimates the economy would stop growing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the other hand simply extending all the expiring tax policies and canceling the spending cuts could add more than $7 trillion to the countrys debt over 10 years</s>
<s>while that would boost growth in 2013 it would hurt the economy by the end of the decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course anyone with a modicum of common sense would prefer a more finessed approach</s>
<s>we have to come up with a compromise to thread this needle said macguineas who appeared at a recent conference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but few observers think that will happen anytime soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead most believe that lawmakers will postpone taking up the issue until after the nov 6 elections giving themselves less than eight weeks to address what may be the largest single package of fiscal issues theyve ever tackled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how did it come to this</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bush tax cuts and amt fix in 2001 2003 and 2006 congress passed a series of tax measures known as the bush tax cuts</s>
<s>they reduced income and investment tax rates shrank the estate tax bite and expanded a number of breaks for low and middleincome families</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile congress regularly extended the temporary patch to the alternative minimum tax so that more than 20 million families wouldnt get trapped by the socalled wealth tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the bush tax cuts and amt patch were allowed to expire as scheduled households would be hit with an average tax increase of $3000 the tax policy center estimates</s>
<s>the lowest 20 of households with a tax increase would pay $512 more on average while the top rung would pay $12819 more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if both policies are extended most people wouldnt notice any changes in the nearterm</s>
<s>but the federal budget would take a longterm hit if lawmakers didnt enact offsetting policies to pay for the extensions which the congressional budget office estimates would cost $535 trillion over 10 years including debt service</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the measures expire the countrys mediumterm debt problem could be greatly reduced</s>
<s>but it would be a blunt strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>far better would be to raise revenue by simplifying and cleaning out tax breaks  rather than adding higher rates on a top of a code that is in many ways broken a report from macguineas crfb said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>big spending cuts as part of the debt ceiling deal congress struck last summer nearly $1 trillion in spending cuts over nine years are set to take effect starting next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition to cutting defense by 10 the socalled sequester will also cut about 8 from nondefense discretionary programs</s>
<s>appropriators havent decided how much to cut specific programs</s>
<s>but individuals are bound to be affected since nondefense spending involves everything from education to law enforcement to housing assistance and national parks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>deficits would be reduced by $12 trillion over 10 years including debt service if the cuts  or a replacement congress agrees on  take effect as scheduled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>doc fix reimbursements to medicare physicians will be cut by close to 30 next year unless lawmakers prevent it</s>
<s>theyve done so for years under the socalled doc fix and are likely to do so again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cost of the doc fix is roughly $30 billion a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax extenders congress regularly extends more than 50 temporary tax breaks for businesses and individuals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the socalled extenders include one that lets businesses accelerate their depreciation for equipment purchases and another that gives individuals the option to deduct state sales taxes on their federal returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the economic value of keeping all the extenders is debatable</s>
<s>tax experts argue that many should be ditched  and those that are kept should be made permanent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>temporarily extending them can cost anywhere from $25 billion to $35 billion a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>payroll tax cut the usual social security tax rate paid by workers is 62 on the first $110100 in wages up from $106800 last year</s>
<s>but for the past two years its been 42</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once the payroll tax holiday expires workers making $50000 will again have to pay an additional $1000 into the system next year  or about $83 a month</s>
<s>those making $100000 would pay double that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cost of extending the payroll tax cut approaches $115 billion a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while it seems unlikely that lawmakers would extend it again if they do they will add to what uncle sam owes social security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why</s>
<s>because congress has decided that the social security trust fund shouldnt take the hit from the payroll tax cut rather general revenue should be used to compensate the fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unemployment benefits congress for the past few years has authorized special help for the jobless  a higher maximum number of weeks that the unemployed can collect benefits</s>
<s>the latest extension expires at the end of the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not clear if lawmakers will extend the policy</s>
<s>doing so would cost roughly $44 billionÂ </s>
