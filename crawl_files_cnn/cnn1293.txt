<s>new york cnnmoney  foreclosure filings nationwide fell for the 22nd straight month in july but a spike in new foreclosures indicates that the housing market still has a long way to go before it works through its backlog of problem loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in july foreclosure filings  including notices of default scheduled auctions or actual bank repossessions  were reported on just under 192000 properties down 3 from the previous month and 10 lower than last year according to realtytrac an online marketer of foreclosed properties</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however foreclosure starts  the earliest stage of the foreclosure process when delinquent borrowers first receive notices that they are in default  rose 6 on a yearoveryear basis</s>
<s>july marked the third straight month that foreclosure starts have increased on an annual basis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new wave of foreclosure filings come in the aftermath of the $25 billion foreclosure settlement which laid out how the banks could atone for years of abusing the foreclosure process  including robosigning</s>
<s>it set firm guidelines for how banks should handle foreclosures and gave them more confidence to start processing foreclosure filings they had previously delayed said daren blomquist a realtytrac spokesman</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that has opened the floodgates in some states especially in socalled judicial states where foreclosures are processed through the courts</s>
<s>connecticut saw a 201 increase in foreclosure starts in july while new jersey and pennsylvania recorded increases of 164 and 139 respectively according to realtytrac</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while the spike in new foreclosure filings isnt great news for the housing market blomquist predicts that fewer of these homes will actually make it all the way through the foreclosure process to the point of repossession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact fewer homes are ending up at that point already</s>
<s>bank repossessions fell 21 yearoveryear in july to 53654 according to realtytrac</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>part of that is due to foreclosure prevention programs like the governments home affordable modification program said blomquist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition banks are processing short sales much more quickly  and even encouraging borrowers to pursue these transactions before falling into foreclosure</s>
<s>under these transactions the home is sold for less than what is owed on the mortgage and the lender agrees to forgive the difference</s>
<s>while the bank still takes a hit on the loan its a much more favorable option than a foreclosure</s>

<s>where the foreclosures are like nearly everything in real estate its all about location</s>
<s>in some states like california foreclosure rates are twice as high as the national average while in places like north dakota theyre barely a blip on realtytracs radar</s>
<s>the state had just three last month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>recent patterns vary significantly from state to state often hinging on the level of dysfunction that exists in each states foreclosure process said blomquist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in states like florida illinois and new jersey where the processing of foreclosures slowed significantly last year in the wake of the robosigning scandal foreclosure activity is picking up</s>
<s>meanwhile in other states like texas arizona and virginia where foreclosures were more quickly processed foreclosure activity has slowed significantly he said</s>
