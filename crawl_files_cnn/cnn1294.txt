<p>
<s>home affordable modification program hamp</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>launch march 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>participation as of july 2012 there have been 19 million trial modifications started</s>
<s>more than 1 million have made the transition into permanent modifications</s>
<s>some 235000 of those have been canceled due to redefaults or because borrowers sold their homes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this program enables eligible borrowers to lower their first mortgage payments to more affordable and sustainable levels</s>
<s>lenders receive incentives to reduce mortgage payments for atrisk borrowers the target is 31 of income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hamp originally fell well short of estimates that it would lower mortgage payments for 3 to 4 million borrowers</s>
<s>and many early workouts failed as borrowers soon redefaulted on their loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>track record hamps record has improved and redefault rates have declined but theyre still troubling</s>
<s>as of july nearly 19 of all borrowers with hamp modifications are at least two payments behind 12 months after their loans were modified</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hamp modifications have slowed to a crawl lately with just 17000 permanent modifications started in july</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the modifications have led to a total of more than $144 billion in lowered borrowers payments according to the treasury department</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>home affordable refinance program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>launch march 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>participation 15 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this program helps borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments but are having a hard time refinancing their mortgage because they are underwater or owe more on their home than it is worth</s>
<s>the home must be underwater due to falling home prices and the mortgage must be backed by fannie mae or freddie mac</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>originally harp allowed homeowners to refinance if their loan balances were between 80 and 105 of the market value of their home</s>
<s>but after disappointing initial results the rule was changed to include borrowers with loantovalue ratios of up to 125</s>
<s>later they removed that cap altogether</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>track record the changes have helped make harp one of the more successful government programs</s>
<s>the number of harp refinancings has accelerated with more issued during the first seven months of the year than in all of 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more than half the loans refinanced in june and july went to homeowners with loantovalue ratios above 105</s>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>participation 90000 borrowers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second lien modification program or 2mp provides assistance to homeowners who have second mortgages or home equity lines of credit in addition to their primary mortgages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many potential mortgage modifications have hit roadblocks because lenders of home equity loans and lines of credit refuse to cooperate</s>
<s>after all the first mortgage holder typically gets paid first when an underwater mortgage gets modified and theres often nothing left for the second lien holder</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related housing improves in hardhit swing states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet second lien holders have to agree to a mortgage modification  and to take a loss  before a loan can be refinanced</s>
<s>under 2mp the government pays cash incentives to the lenders of the second loans so they will allow the refinancing to proceed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>track record so far only 20664 borrowers have had their second mortgages completely wiped out by their second loan lenders with an additional 64977 receiving a partial reduction in their principals</s>
<s>thats a far cry from the estimated one million or more that the program was created to help</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>about 70 of the $11 billion that has been spent for direct homeowner assistance has been in the form of unemployment assistance to help homeowners make their mortgage payments while they seek work according to andrea risotto a spokeswoman for the treasury department</s>
<s>much of the rest went toward helping homeowners who have suffered a financial hardship get current on their payments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>track record only a fraction of the funds has been spent</s>
<s>demand from unemployed borrowers has been much less than anticipated according to risotto</s>
<s>many homeowners dont reach out for assistance right after they lose their job because they think it will just be a shortterm setback she said</s>
