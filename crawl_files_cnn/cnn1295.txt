<s>is there a fourth consumer reporting agency called innovis</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>when we think of consumer reporting agencies we tend to focus on the big three nationwide agencies equifax experian and transunion</s>
<s>innovis has been an affiliate of the privately held cbc companies since 1999 and is sometimes known as the fourth national credit reporting agency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are a number of entities that trade in consumer information and no comprehensive list of who is a reporting agency according to chi chi wu an attorney with the national consumer law center</s>
<s>there are also no minimum requirements or licensing requirements to be a reporting agency she says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said innovis specializes in reselling information compiled from the big three</s>
<s>credit reporting agencies such as innovis may also market mailing lists to creditors</s>
<s>according to wu the only marketing that is federally allowable is prescreening</s>
<s>for example she says a lender may ask for a list of everyone in a certain zip code with a credit score of 720 and the lender will then send firm offers of credit to that list</s>
<s> you can choose not to receive these offers at optoutprescreencom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a good idea to check the accuracy of the information in your credit report at least once a year</s>
<s>you can get a free report from each of the big three at annualcreditreportcom but you can also receive a report from innovis via the companys website at innoviscom</s>
<s>the report may be free or may cost you up to $1150 depending on your state of residence and your individual circumstances</s>
