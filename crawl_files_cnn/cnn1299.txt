<s>its true that bankruptcy carries less of a stigma than it once did</s>
<s>still approach bankruptcy with caution says claire ann resop a bankruptcy lawyer based in madison wis and a former board member of the american bankruptcy institute</s>
<s>for one thing a bankruptcy filing will appear on your credit record for 10 years if youve filed under chapter 7 and seven years if youve filed under chapter 13</s>
<s>chapter 7 bankruptcy lets you eliminate most of your unsecured debt while chapter 13 requires you to participate in a three to fiveyear repayment plan</s>

<p>
<s>you may be able to restore your credit score to healthy levels in as little as two years after filing for bankruptcy according to resop but the filing may still cause you headaches</s>
<s>even though its against the law for landlords to disqualify tenants solely on the basis of a bankruptcy they often treat bankruptcy as a red flag</s>
<s>same thing with employers the us bankruptcy code prohibits employers from discriminating against jobseekers simply because theyve filed for bankruptcy but it may still be a factor — particularly for a job involving financial transactions says resop</s>

<p>
<s>and in those first few years with a low credit score you may not qualify for a home loan — at least not one with a reasonable interest rate</s>
<s>your chances of qualifying for a better loan will increase once your credit has had a chance to heal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for those reasons resop recommends seeking out alternatives to bankruptcy whether its borrowing money from relatives or trying to negotiate a debt settlement with your lenders</s>
<s>but if your financial problems arent fixable and you file for bankruptcy she says youll have to face the consequences</s>
