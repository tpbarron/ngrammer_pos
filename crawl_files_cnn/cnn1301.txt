<s>new york cnnmoney  house speaker john boehner warned tuesday that he wont permit another increase in the debt ceiling without a larger amount of spending cuts and reforms approved in tandem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the time comes i will again insist on my simple principle of cuts and reforms greater than the debt limit increase</s>
<s>this is the only avenue i see  to force the elected leadership of this country to solve our structural fiscal imbalance boehner said at a fiscal summit sponsored by the peter g peterson foundation according to prepared remarks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words welcome to deja vu all over again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>boehner issued a similar warning at this time last year</s>
<s>the end result was a confidenceshaking showdown over the summer that resulted in the budget control act which calls for $21 trillion in spending cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it also sparked the firstever downgrade of the us credit rating by standard  poors which cited political brinksmanship as the chief cause</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>boehner said tuesday we shouldnt dread the debt limit because its an actionforcing event</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yes allowing america to default would be irresponsible he said</s>
<s>but it would be more irresponsible to raise the debt ceiling without taking dramatic steps to reduce spending and reform the budget process</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>boehner made clear that he wants tax reform that lowers rates for individuals and businesses while closing deductions credits and special carveouts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while explicitly ruling out tax increases he allowed that some taxpayers can end up with higher tax bills when breaks and loopholes are eliminated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yeah some may pay more and some may pay less boehner said in a qa with cnns erin burnett</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact thats true of any tax reform</s>
<s>republicans however dont want tax changes to raise more revenue than the current system</s>
<s>but fiscal experts have said more revenue will be required to accomplish the scale of deficit reduction the country needs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite drawing a line in the sand on the debt ceiling boehner seemed to signal that the debt ceiling would be raised but that it might need to be done incrementally</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if  we have to do a series of stopgap measures so be it  but thats not the ideal he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>treasury secretary tim geithner said tuesday at the fiscal summit that he estimates the country will likely hit its $16394 trillion borrowing limit sometime before the end of year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but geithner added the treasury department can use socalled extraordinary measures to keep the debt from breaching the ceiling until early 2013</s>
<s>such steps include suspending contributions to federal pension plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>employing such measures may separate the debt ceiling debate from the tsunami of budget decisions lawmakers must make by years end</s>
<s>thats when the socalled fiscal cliff  $7 trillion worth of expiring tax cuts and spending policies that could undermine the economic recovery if implemented all at once</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time the debt ceiling debate likely wont be entirely separate</s>
<s>lawmakers may choose to temporarily extend some tax cuts and postpone some spending cuts thereby pushing off the real debate until 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if congress fails to raise the debt ceiling and treasury exhausts its extraordinary measures the country will no longer be able to borrow and hence will not be able to pay its bills in full</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>geithner made it clear tuesday much as he did repeatedly last year that creating any doubt that the united states will honor its obligations is a violation of a fundamental commitment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you cant put it into doubt  in the service of any political agenda he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he added that he hopes lawmakers raise the debt ceiling without the pain and drama they caused last time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steny hoyer a leading house democrat echoed those sentiments in comments he made to cnn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the debt limit should not be a political issue</s>
<s>mr boehner knows it shouldnt be a political issue  weve incurred the debts</s>
<s>we need to pay the debts hoyer said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the gop side in the senate sen john cornyn a party leader said he expects senate republicans to demand the same standards as boehner as a condition to approving a debt ceiling increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moderate republican susan collins meanwhile said she hopes washington can avoid the brinksmanship that took place last year which was so unsettling to the public and the markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>speaking on behalf of senate democrats majority leader harry reid said there is simply no way to address the challenges facing us in a way that will support our economic recovery without using both sides of the ledger</s>
