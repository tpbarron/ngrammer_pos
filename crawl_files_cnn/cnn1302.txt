<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  mitt romney is accusing president obama of overseeing the worst jobs recovery since the great depression</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and months of disappointing jobs growth means the president could face election day with fewer workers than on the day he took office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but romneys accusation is wrong  president obamas job gap isnt the worst</s>
<s>in fact it isnt nearly as big as the one president george bush faced eight years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here are the numbers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are 261000 fewer employees on payrolls today than when obama took office</s>
<s>but at the same point of the bush administration the jobs deficit stood at 856000 jobs according to current estimates of the same period</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the data that was reported eight years ago was somewhat different compared with current figures looking at that period since revisions have taken place in the months and years that followed</s>
<s>but on election day 2004 the readings at the time showed the economy with 585000 fewer jobs than when bush took office</s>
<s>as election day approached thenchallenger john kerry was highlighting bushs job gap just as the romney campaign is attacking obama today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related are you better off than four years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>private sector jobs if looking at hiring by businesses the gap is actually much wider  the private sector has actually added 415000 jobs since obama took office</s>
<s>but it had cut 16 million jobs during a comparable period of bushs first term</s>
<s>the difference is that budgetstrapped state and local governments have slashed their staffs over the last four years while they were adding workers when bush was in office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course the unemployment rate which is of greater interest to the average worker  and voter  than the payroll reading was far better  standing at 54 eight years ago rather than the current 81 reading</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related check unemployment in your state</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but 2004s 54 jobless rate was up from a 42 reading when bush took office</s>
<s>by comparison the unemployment rate today is only slightly higher than the 78 rate on the day obama was sworn in and slightly better than the 83 reading a few weeks later</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the romney campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the comparison between obamas job gap and that of his republican predecessor</s>
