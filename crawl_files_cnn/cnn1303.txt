<s>i recently checked my credit report and found that my brother had taken out a credit card in my name</s>
<s>now i have an $11000 debt</s>
<s>should i report my brother for identity theft or should i just report the identity theft without mentioning my brothers name</s>
<s>do i have any options besides reporting my brother and pressing charges</s>
<s>i am afraid that the credit card company will not believe me and i will have to fight a long time to get this off of my credit report</s>
<s>i should mention he has been arrested a few times for financial reasons</s>

<s>as much as you might want to avoid going after your brother ultimately you may have no choice but to report him if you want to successfully dispute the charges</s>
<s>credit card companies are not going to take you seriously unless you have a police report says nikki junker social media manager and victim adviser at the san diegobased identity theft resource center</s>
<s>and if you do file a report its generally standard procedure for the police to ask if you know who committed the crime</s>
<s>junker warns that staying mum can not only jeopardize your chances of clearing your record but could also lead to charges for falsifying a police report</s>

<p>
<s>if your brother admits responsibility for the identity theft and signs a letter promising to pay off the bill in full some credit card companies may consider working out a repayment plan</s>
<s>but junker notes that theyre under no obligation to do so</s>
<s>and if your brother fails to fully repay what he owes them they may pursue you for the remaining balance</s>
<s>this option also wont necessarily keep the police from getting involved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>start by placing an identity fraud alert on your credit reports with the three major credit reporting agencies — equifax experian and transunion</s>
<s>next fill out a federal trade commission fraud affidavit available at wwwftcgov and contact the companies that show charges in your name to let them know youve been a victim of identity theft</s>
<s>if all goes well those companies will issue letters of clearance which you can send to the credit rating agencies to clear your record of fraudulent activity</s>
