<s>if i borrow from my 401k do repayments come out of aftertax or pretax dollars</s>
<s>if they come from aftertax dollars is the money taxed when withdrawn a second time</s>

<s>your repayment of a 401k loan does come from aftertax dollars and when you eventually withdraw those funds in retirement they will be taxable as regular income</s>
<s>but this doesnt represent a second round of taxes</s>
<s>thats because you arent paying taxes or penalties on the amount you borrow in the first place</s>
<s>thats one of the advantages of borrowing money from your 401k says jeanluc bourdon of brightpath wealth management in santa barbara calif</s>

<s>consider it this way your contributions originally were made with pretax dollars</s>
<s>the tax on those contributions are deferred until you begin making withdrawals after age 59 ½</s>
<s>when you borrow from and repay funds to your 401k theres no change to the qualified status of those funds they will still be subject to tax when they are ultimately withdrawn</s>
<s>its as if it was never withdrawn in the first place — just borrowed and repaid says bourdon</s>

<p>
<s>be aware however that not all 401k plans allow you to take out a loan and that loans are typically limited to 50 of your plan assets or $50000 whichever is lower</s>
<s>the loan also must typically be repaid within five years</s>
<s>bourdon warns that if you dont repay your loan on time the unpaid portion will be treated as a taxable distribution and you may face an additional earlywithdrawal 10 penalty if you are younger than 59 ½</s>
