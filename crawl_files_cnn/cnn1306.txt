<s>new york cnnmoney  next year will be a pivotal one for the united states credit standing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moodys said tuesday it would likely strip the united states of its sterling aaa rating if lawmakers fail to produce a longterm debt reduction plan next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if negotiations go well the rating agency said it would probably affirm the countrys aaa rating and change its outlook to stable from negative</s>
<s> a negative outlook suggests the rating could be downgraded over the medium term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thanks to the political brinksmanship that governed last summers debt ceiling standoff standard  poors was the first agency to lower the countrys aaa rating</s>
<s>moodys and fitch decided to stand pat although they did lower their outlooks to negative</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are a lot of ways to approach substantial debt reduction</s>
<s>one of the most abrupt would be to simply let all the measures that make up the socalled fiscal cliff take effect next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fiscal cliff  which consists of a series of tax increases and spending cuts  would curb the debt by roughly $7 trillion over a decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but it would also threaten the economy in the short term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and if thats the course congress chooses or simply fails to avoid moodys said it would likely maintain its negative outlook on the us aaa rating</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>boehner not confident at all about budget deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the agency would then need evidence that the economy could recover from the shock before it would consider returning to a stable outlook moodys said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another factor influencing moodys outlook the debt ceiling which will probably need to be raised by early next year</s>
<s>currently the outlook assumes that congress will increase it in a relatively orderly process</s>
<s> but moodys said it would put the us rating under review during negotiations over the debt limit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what the effects of another downgrade would be are unclear</s>
<s>in the wake of sps downgrade in august 2011 stocks plummeted for a time but the countrys 10year treasury rate actually fell and has since been trading at or near historic lows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>markets are impervious to the whims of the credit rating agencies and instead what really matters is the economic fundamentals and other factors that drive the bond market economic analysis firm capital economics said in a note tuesday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the firm predicted that treasury yields may stay close to 15 over the next couple of years due to slow economic growth low inflation loose monetary policy and the countrys reputation as a safe haven amid the political and fiscal problems in europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but that doesnt let lawmakers off the hook capital economics said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unless congress agrees to a credible mediumterm fiscal plan at some point the markets will lose patience</s>
