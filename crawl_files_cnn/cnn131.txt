<s>an estate tax increase is one of the smallest pieces of the pending fiscal cliff but its as politically charged as any in a time of deficits and debates about tax fairness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the estate tax was here</s>
<s>then it was gone</s>
<s>now its back</s>
<s>and its about to become much bigger next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the estate tax is one of the many pieces of the socalled fiscal cliff facing the country at years end</s>
<s>thats when $7 trillion worth of tax hikes and spending cuts are set to take effect unless congress decides otherwise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the estate tax is paid by a relatively small number of families who inherit wealth but it has always played an outsize role in the political debate over taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and it has traveled a torturous path</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since 2001 the amount of money exempt from the estate tax has been set at six different levels and the top rate has been adjusted nine times according to the american bar association</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rules also changed  then changed back again  on how to value inherited assets and on the gift tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those are just a few examples of how congress kept moving the goal posts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>estate planning lawyers arent optimistic that lawmakers will reform their ways any time soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>oh no</s>
<s>im not at all confident well have something certain going forward said steve hartnett associate director of education at the american academy of estate planning attorneys</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this year estates under $5 million are exempt from the tax</s>
<s>amounts above that are taxed up to a top rate of 35</s>
<s>see how many americans have at least $2 million in wealth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next year barring congressional action the exemption level falls to $1 million and the top rate jumps to 55</s>
<s>there will also be 5 surtax on a portion of very large taxable estates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that suits some liberals just fine</s>
<s>but mitt romney along with many conservatives wants to repeal the estate tax altogether</s>
<s>if that doesnt fly conservatives would at least like to preserve the current $5 million exemption level at 35</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>president obama wants to split the difference an exemption level of $35 million and a top rate of 45</s>
<s>those were the levels in 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whichever option lawmakers ultimately choose the estate taxs reach would remain narrow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this year under the $5 million exemption level less than 02 of those who die  or 3600 estates  are likely to be affected by the estate tax according to estimates from the independent tax policy center</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2013 if the exemption level falls to $1 million the center estimates that just 2 of folks who die that year  or 53000 estates  would be subject to the estate tax</s>
<s>combined the tax on those estates could raise more than $40 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were congress to adopt obamas proposal roughly 7500 estates would be affected in 2013 which would raise roughly $22 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats the fuss</s>
<s>a tax on the transfer of wealth at death has been on the books in one form or another since 1797 according to the joint committee on taxation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>initially the tax was a way to raise revenue for warfare</s>
<s>but by the early 20th century it was intended to break up large concentrations of wealth among the very few</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today those who support having an estate tax also warn about high concentrations of wealth and about the need to raise revenue at a time of high deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those who oppose the tax say it hurts family businesses and farms which may have to sell all or part of their operation just to pay the taxman</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that argument is often countered with findings that very few farms and familyrun businesses have to pay an estate tax to begin with  less than 50 in total in 2011 according to tax policy center estimates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among those that do the data suggest that they have enough liquid assets to satisfy estate tax liabilities the joint committee on taxation wrote in a 2008 report</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what that data dont show is how having to pay an estate tax may affect enterprises ability to grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then again if lawmakers would stop changing the estate tax law so frequently familyrun businesses might be able to better plan for the event in a way that wont impair their prospects for growthÂ </s>
