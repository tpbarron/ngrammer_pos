<s>romney and his wife ann filed a joint 1040 reporting $217 million in 2010 income and $3 million in federal taxes</s>
<s>they also said their 2011 income was $21 million and tax bill was $32 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the two years romneys effective tax rate  the percentage of his income that he owed in federal income taxes  was 145</s>
<s>see correction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nevertheless and contrary to popular perception romneys effective federal income tax rate is still above that of many americans  80 of whom have an effective rate below 15</s>
<s>that tax rate is higher when other federal taxes  such as the payroll tax  are included</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reason romneys rate is so low  despite having one of the highest incomes in the country  is because his income was derived almost entirely from capital gains and dividends from his extensive portfolio of investments</s>
<s>and that form of investment income is typically taxed at just 15 well below the 35 top tax rate for high earners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another reason he had extensive itemized deductions which lowered his overall tax liability</s>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<s>his investment income romney took in $217 million in longterm capital gains over the past two years</s>
<s>of that $129 million was in socalled carried interest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>carried interest is a share of profits paid to general partners at private equity firms  such as bain capital which romney left in 1999</s>
<s>general partners manage the firms investments</s>
<s>if those investments are sold at a profit the carried interest represents a portion of those profits above a minimum rate of return</s>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<s>romney has been under pressure for weeks by questions of whether and when he would release his tax returns</s>
