<s>wonder if federal reserve chairman ben bernanke was thinking the following when he was in front of congress in june since you wont act i guess ill need to do your job too</s>
<s>sigh</s>

<p>
<s>the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul r la monica</s>
<s>other than time warner the parent of cnnmoney and abbott laboratories la monica does not own positions in any individual stocks</s>

<p>
<s>in a move that will forever be known as qe3 because its the federal reserves third round of asset purchases the central bank pledged thursday to buy $40 billion of mortgagebacked securities a month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now lets be honest</s>
<s>the economy isnt in great shape</s>
<s>but things arent as dire as they were in 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even though fed chairman ben bernanke recently referred to the high level of joblessness as a grave concern it was far worse not that long ago</s>
<s>the current unemployment rate is 81 down from a peak of 10 in october 2009  shortly after the great recession officially ended</s>
<s>so we are heading in the right direction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure the recovery in the job market and broader economy has been painfully low and slow</s>
<s>barbecuelike if you will</s>
<s>but it is still a recovery</s>
<s>heck even the housing market seems to be doing a lot better than a year ago</s>
<s>so did we really need more qe right now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many investing experts and economists dont think so  even though the market seems to have an appetite for liquidity and perhaps destruction</s>
<s> thats as insatiable as the peopleeating plant audrey ii from little shop of horrors</s>
<s> feed me benjamin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if any politician dares to complain about the fed  and believe me they will  i have these two words of advice zip it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it seems painfully clear that bernanke and other fed members are worried about the possibility that lawmakers will muck things up later this year by doing what they do best nothing</s>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke has gone out of his way numerous times in speeches and appearances on capitol hill to point out that monetary policy ie</s>
<s>the setting of interest rates by the fed and assetpurchase programs like the qe trilogy and operation twist can only do so much</s>
<s>the fed cut its key shortterm rate to near zero in december 2008 and it has remained there ever since</s>
<s>longterm treasury yields and mortgage rates are already near historic lows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related qe3 wont create jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats needed to get the economy back on track is not more liquidity</s>
<s>its fiscal action by congress</s>
<s>getting the federal debt load under control while simultaneously making sure that budgets for the governments most vital programs be that defense education or social safety nets for the poor are not eviscerated</s>
<s>reforming an antiquated tax code</s>
<s>regulating industries that need more oversight while not going overboard with too many onerous rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke cant change any of that</s>
<s>but with politicians too busy trying to get reelected than actually governing the fed has no choice but to act more aggressively</s>
<s>there are legitimate fears that the lame duck or is it just lame</s>
<s> congress will fail to reach an agreement before the end of the year to avoid the socalled fiscal cliff of automatic spending cuts and higher taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words the fed may feel compelled to act merely to prevent a significant economic slowdown that could occur in the early part of 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>qe3 qe4 or qe5 may not do much to boost the economy</s>
<s>the bigger issues are concerns about the election regulation and the fiscal cliff said wilmer stith manager of the wilmington broad market bond fund arkix in baltimore</s>
<s>but there hasnt been this much political uncertainty since the great depression and this is the worst possible time to have it</s>
<s>if we fall off the fiscal cliff wed likely enter another recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related what the fed should do but probably wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the irony here is that the fed has often been criticized for being too reactive as opposed to proactive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its fair to suggest that bernanke should have done a better job of connecting the dots and recognizing that the housing bubble was going to lead to major economic problems instead of maintaining like he did in front of congress in march 2007 that the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but bernanke seems to have learned his lesson and now realizes that the bigger risk is to sit and wait</s>
<s>it would be a mistake to assume that everything will work out okay in congress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the fed isnt there to reassure the markets and big foreign owners of our debt like china and japan that it has a plan to keep rates low in the event the economy grinds to a complete standstill bond yields could quickly shoot higher</s>
<s>and then the comparisons to the most debtladen nations in europe would quickly become more apt</s>
</p>

<s>related moodys says us credit rating hinges on congress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure fears of the fiscal cliff could be for naught</s>
<s>lawmakers could reach a lastminute deal that actually helps the economy</s>
<s>this could turn out to be the 20122013 equivalent of the y2k computer bug fears that some thought would bring the economy to a halt in 2000</s>
<s>paging dr ed yardeni</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are also valid concerns that bernanke may be simply inflating yet another asset bubble by keeping rates artificially low for this long</s>
<s>still inflation is not a significant concern at the current time  even though more qe could lead to a weaker dollar and another spike in oil prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sadly bernanke is in a nowin situation</s>
<s>he is correct to point out that fiscal reforms are now more important than further monetary easing</s>
<s>too bad his cries are being ignored by our nations least and dimmest on capitol hill</s>
<s>as if his own job wasnt hard enough bernanke has to provide more stimulus for the economy because congress seems unwilling to do so</s>
<s>sad</s>
