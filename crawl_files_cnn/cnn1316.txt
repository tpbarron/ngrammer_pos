<s>california lawmakers approve a new budget plan that they crafted with governor jerry brown center</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  california lawmakers approved an $86 billion budget late tuesday that imposes deep spending cuts but does not extend tax hikes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the budget is a disappointment for governor jerry brown a democrat who spent months trying to convince republican legislators to put an extension of personal income and sales tax increases before the voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unable to do so brown and democratic legislative leaders cobbled together a plan that calls for a total of $146 billion in cuts</s>
<s>much of the bloodletting was agreed to in march but this weeks deal would add at least $25 billion in additional reductions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>putting our state on a sound and sustainable fiscal footing still requires much work but we have now taken a huge step forward brown said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>overall the department of health and human services would be slashed by $5 billion while the department of corrections and rehabilitation would see a cut of $1 billion</s>
<s>the states two university systems would each lose $650 million in funding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the budget hinges on the state bringing in $4 billion in more in tax revenues in the coming year than was initially expected</s>
<s>the improving economy has pushed the states tax collections billions of dollars above estimates in recent months</s>
<s>brown expects the windfall to continue into fiscal 2012 which starts friday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if tax revenue comes in lower than expected the budget also would impose an additional $26 billion in cuts to higher education corrections and inhome support services for the elderly and disabled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the proposal would slash billions in spending for children the sick and the elderly said senate president pro tem darrell steinberg</s>
<s>and it would hurt the states economy he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this budget is the most austere fiscal blueprint california has seen in a generation steinberg said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the budget does not call for tax increases it requires only a majority of the democraticled legislature to approve it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however governor brown and his fellow democrats said they plan to put a tax measure on the ballot in november 2012 through a voter initiative  bypassing the requirement for republican consent</s>
<s>thats the only way california can afford to pay for the services it provides they said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is clear that there is no realistic longterm solution to californias structural deficit that doesnt involve new revenues said assembly speaker john perez</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though they fended off browns tax extensions republicans immediately attacked the proposal saying california needs a budget that will revitalize the economy and create jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a hope without change budget said senate republican leader bob dutton</s>
<s>it relies on the hope for billions of phantom dollars and does nothing absolutely nothing to change government as usual</s>
<s>even worse it does nothing to put people back to work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the proposal is a major shift for brown who has said for months that the states $26 billion budget gap should be addressed with a mix of spending cuts and tax extensions</s>
<s>he also was determined to fulfill his pledge to put the extension of personal income and sales taxes before the voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however he could not convince four republicans to join him so he could get the measure on the ballot</s>
<s>a budget containing a tax hike needs the support of twothirds of lawmakers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>republicans have refused to go along unless the budget also contained a spending cap as well as pension and regulatory reform</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the latest proposal was put together less than two weeks after brown vetoed a budget approved by the legislature saying it was chock full of gimmicks and contained legally questionable maneuvers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lawmakers had raced to pass a spending plan by june 15 to meet a voterimposed deadline that required the legislature to pass a balanced budget or forfeit their pay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however state controller john chiang determined that the budget was actually unbalanced</s>
<s>so lawmakers who earn $95291 a year and $142 per diem for each day they are in session have gone without pay since midmonthÂ </s>
