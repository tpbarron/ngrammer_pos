<s>martin feldstein an economics professor at harvard is an adviser to republican nominee mitt romney</s>
<s>he served as the chairman of the council of economic advisers under president ronald reagan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we spoke with him at the federal reserves economic symposium in jackson hole wyo shortly after ben bernanke seemed to make a case for more stimulus from the central bank</s>
<s>heres what feldstein said were some of the potential risks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the risk that worries me most is the risk about the exit strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we dont have a clear idea of how far they would have to raise rates to deal with banks that have more than a trillion dollars of excess reserves deposited at the fed</s>
<s>when the time comes they may have to raise rates a lot and at that time unemployment may be higher than it normally is when the fed normally wants to raise rates  thats because of this big amount of longterm unemployment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i can imagine a situation where the economy starts to recover where the unemployment rate is still nevertheless quite high and if theres pricing capability on the part of businesses the fed wants to deal with that  congress may be very unhappy with the thought of fed tightening</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fed may feel they ought to tighten but feel threatened that if they do congress may take away some of their powers</s>
<s>what does the fed do if it thinks it could lose the right to buy anything other than treasury bonds or the right to buy the quantity of bonds its been buying</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it would be a difficult decision</s>
<s>when i talk to people at the fed about this they say  we will do the right thing</s>
<s> the only question is what is the right thing</s>
<s>is it the right thing not to risk losing authority or is it the right thing to raise interest rates even if it involves that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the more liquidity you put out there the greater that problem is going to be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some economists have recently raised more fears about the fed fueling a bond bubble</s>
<s>how would the scenario play out if a bond bubble burst</s>
<s>who would the main victims be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is there a potential bond bubble now</s>
<s>absolutely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the fed werent buying and if the chinese achieved their trade goal ceasing to have a current account surplus as they have said in their fiveyear plan  they will not have the ability to buy our bonds</s>
<s>in fact they would have to sell bonds if they want to go around buying other things</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a similar fashion if the japanese economy begins to pick up they could also be in a position where theyre no longer buying our bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>put all that together and you could see interest rates returning to more normal levels</s>
<s>this spills over into equity markets and if longterm bonds go up mortgages go up and the housing market gets hurt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we would all be the victims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what would this mean for the feds balance sheet</s>
<s>would there be a real loss </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if theyre sitting there holding longterm bonds the fed is at risk of a capital loss</s>
<s>in a sense that doesnt matter</s>
<s>its a paper loss they havent sold it theyre just holding it  so i guess in that sense there is no loss</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but their opponents in congress will say the fed just lost $200 billion and in an accounting sense that will be true</s>
<s>its an extra risk that the fed takes about its own longterm authority</s>
</p>
