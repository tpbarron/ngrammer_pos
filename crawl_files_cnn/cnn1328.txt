<s>new york cnnmoney  a move designed to punish chinese solar panel makers that charge unfairly low prices in the united states could ironically end up hurting americanbased solar panel installers a fastgrowing sector of the green economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last week the department of commerce announced it would impose punitive tariffs as high as 250 on panels imported from china after finding that chinese companies have been dumping them at prices below production costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but many installation firms in the united states rely on lowerpriced chinesemade solar panels and say the tariffs will hit their businesses hard  potentially increasing their costs hurting demand for their services and stalling their hiring plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for marylandbased standard solar a residential and commercial installer of solar panels the ruling couldnt have come at a worse time</s>
<s>the companys sales have been doubling every year reaching $75 million last year and its staff has grown from three in 2007 to more than 100 today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that type of growth isnt unusual in the $84 billion industry</s>
<s>there are now 2200 us firms that put in solar panels and installations surged 109 last year according to the solar energy industries association</s>
<s>fueling this boom is a 30 tax credit on solar installations as well as an overall decline in solar panel prices</s>

<s>at standard solar ceo tony clifford wants to keep his firms momentum going but worries that his chinese suppliers now will raise their prices to offset the new tariffs</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>were growing fast partly because prices for solar modules have been going down he said</s>
<s>and thats brought down our overall business costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>standard solar was looking to hire up to 25 new workers this year to handle the business pickup</s>
<s>but for now those plans are on hold until he sees how his suppliers respond to the tariffs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>demand for his firm is very pricesensitive he said</s>
<s>if i cant meet my costs im in trouble</s>
<s>but if i raise my prices it will hurt both my residential and commercial business</s>

<s>an 1800squarefoot house typically requires between 12 and 20 solar panels he said</s>

<p>
<s>between materials and labor putting solar panels on a house costs installers $20000 on average estimates shyam mehta an analyst with gtm research</s>
<s>the new tariffs could increase these costs by 10 said mehta</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the prospect of higher costs worries jeff wolfe ceo of grosolar a vermontbased firm that installs commercial solar panel systems</s>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>his hiring plans are now in flux</s>
<s>we have a few job openings right now but im rethinking them said wolfe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wolfes also concerned that if hes forced to raise his prices he could lose out on new projects which bring in $5 million to $15 million each on average</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these tariffs mark a very sad day for the industry said wolfe whos been in the field for 14 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mehta the analyst said new tariffs might indeed temporarily slow homeowners and businesses demand for solar panels but that prices would eventually adjust and the industry would continue to grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>calling current demand for solar panels really strong mehta added i dont think these tariffs will hold back that trend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile us solar panel manufacturers are cheering the tariffs</s>
<s>ostrenga whose company is one of 600 american manufacturers of solar modules said the trade action is necessary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these tariffs were needed to protect american manufacturers said ostrenga</s>
<s>chinese competitors had captured 60 of market share in the $28 billion solar panel manufacturing sector in just a few years he said because they were unfairly undercutting american companies on prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this situation was unsustainable said ostrenga</s>
<s>it was hurting us</s>
<s>we couldnt compete</s>
<s>it had to be fixed</s>
