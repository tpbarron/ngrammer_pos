<s>this guy and short sellers may be enjoying the earnings garbage these days</s>
<s>but most investors do not love the market turmoil</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul r la monica</s>
<s>other than time warner the parent of cnnmoney and abbott laboratories la monica does not own positions in any individual stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors are in an oscar the grouchlike mood</s>
<s>but unlike the fuzzy green muppet they dont love trash</s>
<s>and thats exactly what the latest slew of corporate earnings reports are dirty dingy and dusty</s>
<s>rotten ragged and rusty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stocks plummeted tuesday after dow components dupont dd united technologies utx and 3m mmm issued underwhelming outlooks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that follows weak guidance from caterpillar cat on monday and a big drop for the market on friday following disappointing results from tech giants google goog and microsoft msft as well as lackluster numbers from general electric ge and mcdonalds mcd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nearly all of these companies mentioned challenging macroeconomic environments around the globe that is crimping demand for their products and services</s>
<s>several suggested that they will be restructuring in order to boost profits with dupont announcing 1500 layoffs</s>
<s>chipmaker amd amd also let forth a deluge of pink slips last week announcing it would cut 15 of its workforce</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this relentless drum beat of poor corporate news should not come as a surprise to anyone</s>
<s>chinas economy is undeniably slowing</s>
<s>europe particularly greece and spain still looks like a triage center</s>
</p>

<s>related cnnmoney fear  greed index now flashing fear signals</s>

<p>
<s>and while growth in the united states seems to be stabilizing that could all come to a grinding halt if congress closes its eyes and takes a step off the fiscal cliff at the end of the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but guess what</s>
<s>even though the sp 500 has slumped nearly 3 in the past five days and the broader market may finish october in the red investors may need to prepare themselves for an even deeper pullback in the coming weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>companies are no longer able to cut expenses fast enough to compensate for sluggish sales</s>
<s>they did that already in 2008 and 2009</s>
<s>the only way for earnings to significantly improve over the next few quarters will be if demand gets better</s>
<s>plain and simple</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lacking that the market still seems ripe for a bigger downturn</s>
<s>considering that some highprofile bellwethers such as apple aapl google verizon vz and ibm ibm have either already entered or are very near correction status ie</s>
<s>down 10 from recent highs shouldnt the broader market do the same</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dow and sp 500 are only 4 below their 52week highs</s>
<s>the nasdaq is getting closer to a correction which makes sense given that apple is such a huge component of that index</s>
<s>but its still down just 68 from its 52week high and remains up nearly 15 in 2012</s>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>now the good news for market bulls is that valuations are still relatively attractive for stocks</s>
<s>the sp 500 is currently trading at 13 times consensus earnings estimates for 2013 according to thomson one</s>
<s>that seems reasonable for now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but analysts are only predicting earnings growth of 7 for next year</s>
<s>what if those estimates get cut</s>
<s>thats a plausible scenario given all the aforementioned global risks</s>
<s>a midteens market multiple may be too expensive if earnings are only going to increase in the lowtomiddle single digits  which is why stocks arguably need to fall further</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it doesnt appear that investors have priced in the possibility of slow economic and earnings growth in 2013 yet</s>
<s>if stocks pull back a bit more that could set investors up for a nice rally next year if results do turn out to be better than forecasts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course its not all doom and gloom for corporate america</s>
<s>luxury retailer coach coh and shipping giant ups ups topped forecasts</s>
<s>thats encouraging</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but some of the other companies that were bright spots in the market tuesday merely beat low expectations</s>
<s>yahoo yhoo rallied on an earnings beat and hopes that new ceo marissa mayer will finally turn around the struggling internet media firm</s>
<s>thats a companyspecific story not a sign that online advertising is robust</s>
<s>we already got the bad macro news from google last week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>likewise motorcycle maker harleydavidson hog revved higher even though profits and sales fell from a year ago</s>
<s>they just didnt fall as much as analysts were expecting</s>
<s>hardly cause for raucous celebration</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>keep that in mind if netflix nflx and facebook fb two downontheirluck tech stocks report betterthanexpected results after the bell tuesday</s>
<s>the bar for them is low</s>
<s>what investors will need to see to get excited about the broader market are strong results from the likes of apple att t amazon amzn and boeing ba later this week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for now earnings are to quote our friend oscar again just like that fish hes got wrapped inside some old newspaper</s>
<s>smelly and cold</s>
<s> and the market would trade those earnings for a big pot of gold</s>
