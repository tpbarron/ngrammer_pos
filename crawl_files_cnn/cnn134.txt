<s>new york cnnmoney  the tax bills of mitt romney and warren buffett raise a longrunning question why do americans get taxed less on their investment gains than on their paychecks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact for much of the past century longterm capital gains have been taxed at lower rates than ordinary income although often at levels higher than todays 15 rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and for much of the past century its been a contentious issue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one side says preferential treatment for capital gains is just plain unfair</s>
<s>the tax code they say is being used to help the rich get richer since they make more of their income from capital gains than anyone else</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their solution tax capital gains as regular income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then theres the counter argument  that capital gains if anything should be taxed more lightly or better yet not at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>capital gains are double taxed one of the principal arguments for taxing capital gains at a lower rate is double taxation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it goes like this stock prices are bolstered by corporate profits which are subject to corporate tax</s>
<s>therefore gains made on stocks have already been taxed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax experts like len burman and martin sullivan say that double taxation is dumb  actually theyre more likely to use the term inefficient</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but they also note the limitations of the doubletaxation argument some capital gains really are only taxed once</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for instance some assets that produce capital gains are not subject to a corporate tax</s>
<s>think real estate art or a passthrough business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and some capital gains escape taxation altogether</s>
<s>a beneficiary of an estate does not owe tax on the capital gains accrued on an asset during the lifetime of the person who died</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many gains are just inflation one reason to keep capital gains rates lower is inflation</s>
<s>that is some portion of ones gains can be attributed to inflation between the purchase and sale of an asset</s>
<s>and sometimes its the whole kahuna</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax expert bruce bartlett in a 2001 paper cited research showing that after accounting for inflation investors booked a real investment loss of $231 billion on nominal gains of $3 trillion between 1946 and 1977</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to help mitigate the inflation hit lawmakers have typically taxed capital gains at a lower rate than ordinary income or let investors exclude some portion of their gains from taxation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a lower rate spurs the economy the most common argument for a lower gains rate is that it spurs investment and risktaking which can lead to economic growth and higher federal revenue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>burman doesnt doubt a lower rate might spur investment and risktaking</s>
<s>but theres no proven correlation with economic growth he said</s>
<s>it doesnt prove theres not a relationship</s>
<s>its just not the silver bullet its made out to be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in part that may be because its hard to quantify risktaking bartlett noted in his new book about tax reform the benefit and the burden</s>
<s> but he also asserts that that impact of a lower gains rate on growth is ambiguous</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>policy experts worry that a high capital gains rate can cause investors to hold onto assets longer than they otherwise might preventing them from using their gains to reinvest in other assets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then again some say a higher rate wont deter investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i have yet to see anyone  not even when capital gains rates were 399 in 197677  shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain billionaire investor warren buffett wrote in a new york times oped</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a lot of arguments made to justify a low capital gains rate are really about general flaws with the tax system not a reason to lower the capital gains rate per se burman said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one argument for not singling out capital gains for special relief they are not the only kind of capital income that can be double taxed or hurt by inflation</s>
<s>so are dividends</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and creating special tax breaks for capital gains gives people a reason to seek out tax shelters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one proposed solution is to tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income but significantly lower ordinary income tax rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that was the recommendation of president obamas bipartisan debt commission and the bipartisan policy centers debt reduction task force</s>
<s>and its what president reagan and congress did when they reformed the tax code in 1986</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you tax capital gains as ordinary income it raises a lot of revenue to cut other rates said burman who worked on the 1986 reform and was a member of the bipartisan policy center task force</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it maintains high progressivity while lowering rates and it closes down the biggest opportunity for tax shelters</s>
