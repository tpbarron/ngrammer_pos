<s>money magazine  i am 35 and consider myself an aggressive investor</s>
<s>i have at least 90 of my money in stock mutual funds</s>
<s>am i being reckless by not putting more in bonds and cash</s>
<s>ive heard that a good rule of thumb is to limit your stock percentage to 110 less your age</s>
<s>but i feel like i will be giving up so much in potential gains</s>

<p>
<s>i dont think youre reckless for having 90 of your longterm investments in stocks as long as youre aware of and truly comfortable with the often bumpy ride equities provide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but i do give a thumbsdown to relying on a rule of thumb</s>
<s>for years the accepted wisdom was to subtract your age from 100 to get the percentage of assets that should go into equities</s>
<s>in the 80s bull market 100 morphed to 110</s>
<s>when the stock feeding frenzy of the 90s dotcom boom took hold 120 became the standard</s>
<s>you have to question a benchmark that changes with shifting investor sentiment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still this rule is a useful framework for how you should think about stocks superior return potential</s>
<s>no matter the number the point holds that you should emphasize stocks when you have plenty of time to recover from setbacks and dial back as you age and preserving capital becomes a higher priority</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to come up with an ideal stock target however most advisers look not just at your age but also how much you can save and how you react when the market tanks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another factor is your earnings potential</s>
<s>if you work in an industry where layoffs are common or pay can fluctuate dramatically think financial services or real estate you might want to offset that risk by owning more bonds</s>
<s>with a more predictable income you can tilt a bit more toward stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>taking all those factors into account a typical recommendation for a person your age is to keep anywhere from 70 to 90 of your longterm investments in stocks</s>
<s>so youre on the high end</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with any of those stock allocations  along with good savings habits throughout your career  you should be able to retire comfortably according to the advice firm financial engines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your fear that youll give up potential returns if you dial back your stock stake though isnt unfounded</s>
<s>as the graphic in the left column shows the more you put in stocks the more income youre likely to have in retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were talking potential though not a guarantee</s>
<s>because of their higher volatility stocks have a greater downside risk</s>
<s>and you have to live with the daytoday gyrations and everpresent possibility of a serious setback</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you dont seem bothered by the threat of a downturn yet i find that feelings about risk tolerance change when a market collapse wipes out a big portion of the money youve saved</s>
<s>thats good reason to be less gungho</s>
