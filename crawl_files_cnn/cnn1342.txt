<s>when i looked at the funds offered in my girlfriends 401k plan i noticed that almost all of the funds had maintenance fees of more than 165 and a 1 deferred load</s>
<s>is this common for 401ks</s>
<s>are there ways to minimize her 401k expenses</s>

<p>
<s>you are right to be concerned since those fees are fairly high</s>
<s>by comparison money recently reported that average annual expenses for plans of various sizes ranged from 036 in the biggest plans to 14 in the smallest</s>
<s>for more detail on 401k fees go to httpmoneycnncom20120725retirement401kfeesmoneymagindexhtm</s>
<s> from year to year the high fees in your girlfriends plan could be a serious drag on returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one way to minimize the impact of fees is to look for passively managed index funds which are likely to be the cheapest offerings available in her 401k</s>
<s>if her plan doesnt currently offer index funds she might consider lobbying her employer or plan sponsor to bring in some lowercost options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if she has done what she can to lower fees she should continue to fund her 401k in order to receive any employer matching</s>
<s>thats free money and even with the slightly higher fees it will provide a net boost to her retirement savings</s>
<s>but she might consider making contributions beyond that amount to a selfdirected ira or roth ira</s>
<s>just be aware that contributions to iras are limited to $5000 per year $6000 for those 50 or older which is much lower than the current annual 401k contribution limit of $17000 or $22500 for those 50 or older</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the key benefit of iras to your girlfriend is that they typically feature a much broader range of funds than the average 401k plan</s>
<s>many of these options such as etfs charge lower fees than the average equity mutual fund</s>
