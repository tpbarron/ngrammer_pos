<s>new york cnnmoney  with the elections out of the way the time to actually govern has arrived</s>
<s>and the pending fiscal cliff will test everyones mettle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fiscal cliff is the legislative equivalent of a slowmotion train wreck that congress and president obama can avoid  but only if they work together</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some seasoned washington observers think they will do just that despite their troubled history because they dont want to be blamed for what happens if they fail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but others say theres a good chance they wont because the election did nothing to ease the partisan chasm over taxes</s>
<s>they argue that only a market crash or a crisis over the countrys debt ceiling will force their hand</s>
<s>cnncom 5 things we learned on election night</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fiscal cliff  which starts to take effect in january  includes $7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts over a decade</s>
<s>in addition the debt ceiling will need to be raised by early next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the fiscal cliff policies at issue reductions in both defense and nondefense spending the expiration of the bush tax cuts the end of a payroll tax holiday and extended unemployment benefits and the onset of reimbursement cuts to medicare doctors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related whats really in the fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lawmakers must choose whether to leave those measures in place replace some or all of them postpone them or cancel them entirely</s>
<s>their decision will affect the economy the countrys credit rating and the us debt burden</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>failure to avoid the fiscal cliff and raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner as well as securing agreement on credible deficit reduction would likely result in a rating downgrade in 2013 fitch ratings warned on wednesday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if left in place the fiscal cliff would lead to the biggest singleyear drop in the annual deficit as a percent of the economy since 1969</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but because it would be so abrupt and arbitrary it also could throw the united states back into a recession next year when more than $500 billion will be taken out of the economy</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>tax hike on the rich is key like many democrats and republicans the president doesnt like the automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts called for under the socalled sequester</s>
<s>he wants them replaced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the white house has indicated obama wont accept a package that just reverses the defense cuts as the republicans want</s>
<s>and senior administration officials said recently that obama would veto any fiscal cliff package that extends the bush tax cuts for top earners a key republican demand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the president himself hasnt used the word veto</s>
<s> instead he has urged congress to work on those things we can agree on  namely to extend the bush tax cuts for the majority of americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related fiscal cliff would cause recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on wednesday house speaker john boehner held fast to the republican line that no ones tax rates should go up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we wont solve the problem of our fiscal imbalance overnight he said</s>
<s>and we certainly wont solve it by simply raising tax rates or taking a plunge off the fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in an interview with the des moines register before his reelection obama expressed confidence that a grand bargain on debt reduction could occur within six months of his second term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed some expect that obama will put out a new debtreduction proposal soon after the elections said steve bell the economic policy director of the bipartisan policy center</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but lawmakers and policy experts also say the most they expect to happen before the end of the year will be for congress to pass a bridge or framework package that teesup the next congress to do the heavy lifting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no easy way out congressional scholar norman ornstein sees one of three outcomes</s>
<s>in one 70 senators and major business leaders lock arms on a framework deal that includes raising revenue for deficit reduction</s>
<s>obama endorses it and pressures the house to at least vote on it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such a framework might mean lawmakers postpone fiscal cliff measures for several months and agree to strike a large deficitreduction deal by a date certain next year according to agreedupon targets for spending and revenue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another possibility ornstein said is that obama meets resistance from house republicans</s>
<s>so he takes a hard line and lets the country go over the cliff only to introduce on jan 1 what hed characterize as one of the biggest tax cuts in american history  for everyone except the top 1</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a third option ornstein suggested is that everybody agrees to postpone the fiscal cliff until march to give more time to work out a deal and to keep the economy from slipping into recession in january</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>any of these could happen none are ideal ornstein said</s>
<s>one wild card of course is the reaction of the markets</s>
