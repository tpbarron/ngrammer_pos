<s>new york cnnmoneycom  highincome households will be paying more into medicare as a result of the new health reform law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for starters the medicare payroll tax is going up for individuals making more than $200000 in wages and couples making more than $250000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>currently the medicare payroll tax is 29 on all wages  with the worker and his employer each paying 145</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under the new law starting in 2013 highincome individuals will pay another 09 percentage points on earned income over $200000 $250000 if married</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a single person making $250000 will pay an additional $450 a year into medicare relative to what he pays today according to calculations by deloitte</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if he made $1 million he will pay an additional $7200</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>couples making $500000 in wages will pay an additional $2250</s>
<s>if they made $1 million they would pay an additional $6750</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition highincome households would also be subject to a new 38 medicare tax on investment income starting in 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what qualifies as investment income also known as unearned income</s>
<s>capital gains dividends interest annuities royalties and rents are some examples</s>
<s>any investment income that had previously been characterized as tax exempt would not be subject to the new tax however</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres how the new tax on investment income would work it will hit those people whose gross income roughly speaking wages plus investment income exceeds the $200000 threshold for individuals or $250000 for couples</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but because of how the proposal is structured you might not owe the 38 tax on all your investment income</s>
<s>heres why the tax would apply to whichever is less  your investment income or the amount that your modified adjusted gross income agi exceeds the highincome threshold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>say you have $50000 more in modified agi than the threshold</s>
<s>if your investment income exceeds that amount you would only owe the 38 tax on $50000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so how might a highincome persons tax bill change overall when the medicare wage tax is increased and a new medicare tax on investment income is also imposed</s>
<s>a single taxpayer making $1 million in wages and $100000 in capital gains income would pay an additional $11000 into medicare than he does today according to deloitte</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>deloitte notes that its possible that even if a persons total income exceeds the income threshold he may only be subject to the medicare investment tax but not the increase in the medicare payroll tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>say a person makes $190000 in wages and on top of that takes in $30000 in investment income</s>
<s>that person would not be subject to the increased medicare payroll tax because his wages fall below the threshold but he would have to pay the new investment income tax because his total income exceeds the $200000 threshold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>raising the medicare tax on wages will raise an estimated $87 billion over 10 years</s>
<s>but combined with a new medicare tax on investment income the revenue collected will jump to an estimated $210 billion making it the biggest single revenue raiser to help pay for health reformÂ </s>
