<s>the market is off to a great start in 2012 but it may be tough for stocks to keep climbing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the nasdaq shot up 8 in january</s>
<s>8 in one month</s>
<s>unless you are extremely greedy that would be a good year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dow and sp 500 also surged in january rising 34 and 44 respectively</s>
<s>thats the best beginning to a year for those blue chip indexes since 1997</s>
<s>stocks continued to sizzle on the first day of february</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but should investors be prepared for the markets to cool off after such a scintillating start</s>
<s>or will the socalled january barometer the notion that whenever the market rises in january it should finish the year higher work its magic again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>usually a hot january does lead to a great year for stocks</s>
<s>in 1997 for example the sp 500 wound up gaining an astonishing 31</s>
<s>however this is not an ironclad rule</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that 8 jump in the nasdaq i mentioned</s>
<s>that was the best performance for the nasdaq since 2001  and 2001 wound up being a terrible year for the markets</s>
<s>the sp 500 fell 13 and the nasdaq lost more than 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course 2001 was an unusual year because of the 911 attacks</s>
<s>it was also a year when the economy was in recession</s>
<s>there is a good case to be made that stocks should do well this year since the economy is slowly but surely recovering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fundamentals are more encouraging</s>
<s>so i could easily see a low doubledigit return for stocks by the end of the year said jack ablin chief investment officer with bmo harris private bank in chicago</s>
<s>but there are still broader challenges for the markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so its probably a stretch to expect another year like 1997</s>
<s>sure the eventual facebook ipo could usher in another boom year for tech stocks</s>
<s>however there are many factors that could cause stocks to flatline or even quickly pull back following januarys jump</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>europe is still not out of the woods</s>
<s>the news keeps getting better</s>
<s>but until there is certainty that greece will not default and that larger nations like spain and italy can get their fiscal problems under control investors will remain nervous about the health of the big banks</s>
<s>thats bad for the broader market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>speaking of the banks investors should be concerned that last years junk stocks are leaders this year</s>
<s>bofa bac fortune 500 is up nearly 30</s>
<s>citigroup c fortune 500 is up 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beyond the financials beaten down momentum stocks like netflix nflx and first solar fslr are surging too</s>
<s>those two stocks are heavy targets of short sellers</s>
<s>the big move up in last years losers reeks of speculation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>trading volume continues to be so light that it makes me think that its oh so quiet the 50s tune popularized by bjorks cover version should be the markets theme song</s>
<s>shh</s>
<s>shh</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and heres an interesting twist about the market</s>
<s>even though stocks are surging its clear that investors arent completely willing to throw in the towel on socalled safe haven assets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gold has shot up again</s>
<s>treasury bond yields are heading back toward record lows as well</s>
<s>investors have been scooping up 10years since the fed announced it was likely to leave interest rates near zero until the end of 2014</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its pretty rare for bonds and stocks to both enjoy solid gains for a full year</s>
<s>something has to give</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other big wild card for 2012 is that this is a presidential election year</s>
<s>and it is one that is expected to be highly contentious</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many investors were rightfully worried last year about the buffoonery in washington</s>
<s>politics as usual on steroids led to the united states getting stripped of its aaa credit rating last summer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with lawmakers likely to spend most of their efforts this year on reelection as opposed to actually doing whats best for the country the dreaded political uncertainty that led to a lot of market volatility in 2011 could be even more prevalent as the year drags on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so when all is said and done i think the only thing investors can safely bet on is more volatility</s>
<s>we may have more months like january before the year is over</s>
<s>but we could also have several months where stocks fall more than 4 sprinkled in as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nobody is hoping for a repeat of 2011</s>
<s>that was a frustrating year to manage money</s>
<s>however the economic data is just okay</s>
<s>i dont see how profits can surge enough to keep the january rally going said john norris managing director with oakworth capital bank in birmingham ala</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if we can end this year up 8 you should consider yourself happy</s>
<s>these are more volatile markets norris added</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>best of stocktwits if you swim in the amazon you may get bitten by piranhas</s>
<s>the online retailers sales missed targets and investors are worried about rising expenses eating into profits</s>
<s>kudos to firstadopter for being skeptical tuesday</s>
<s>hes got more to say</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>firstadopter when growth companys growth slows multiples compress</s>
<s>fa law of investing $amzn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>definitely</s>
<s>i still think amazon amzn fortune 500 is an amazing growth story</s>
<s>but it doesnt deserve a tripledigit pe ratio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stocksage1 $amzn is a long term story this is not a long term story market  stock will need time to prove itself  below 175  attractive value imo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>amazon did fall as low as $172 this morning before bouncing back to about $176</s>
<s>so there may be several investors looking to buy when its under $175</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ktr8der how does $amzn get away with not releasing sales numbers on their most touted products</s>
<s>kindle fire ethics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that bugs me too</s>
<s>apple aapl fortune 500 does a great job of releasing sales for iphones ipads macs etc</s>
<s>amazon should be more transparent about kindle sales</s>
<s>its nice that sales nearly tripled during the holidays</s>
<s>but from what to what</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>createcapital getting into the hardware business is the kiss of death for anyone but apple</s>
<s>$amzn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not sure about that</s>
<s>amazon may be able to absorb the losses on the kindle as long as it sells a lot of digital content</s>
<s>speaking of that </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>irwebreport i dont own $amzn because i cant get past the idea of tech company shipping diapers</s>
<s>if they spun off digital goods and web services sure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a great point</s>
<s>as i said in todays buzz video amazon is still essentially nothing more than a lowmargin retailer</s>
<s>amazons cloud business holds great promise and services revenue did surge nearly 75 in the fourth quarter</s>
<s>but services still only accounted for 12 of total sales in the fourth quarter</s>
