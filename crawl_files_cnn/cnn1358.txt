<s>money magazine  the bursting bubbles of the 1990s and 2000s caught most of the experts by surprise</s>
<s>not robert shiller</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yale economist isnt so much a forecaster as a historian of financial data</s>
<s>his work on the history of stocks led him to advocate a market valuation tool now popularly known as the shiller pe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>traditional priceearnings ratios compare todays share prices with often overly bullish estimates of future profits and can sometimes make stocks look more reasonably priced than they really are</s>
<s>shiller looked instead at the averaged 10year history of earnings which captures both the ups and the downs of the business cycle</s>
<s>this pe flashed red warning lights as it reached new highs during the tech boom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next shillers research into home values led him to conclude in 2005 that real estate looked bubblelike</s>
<s>today he still isnt much of a stock market optimist</s>
<s>but in his new book finance and the good society he argues that wall street can be a force for progress his conversation with editoratlarge penelope wang has been edited</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you have become famous for your cyclically adjusted 10year priceearnings ratio</s>
<s>what do the latest numbers say about future stock market returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when my former student and i did the original analysis  i was working with john campbell now economics department chairman at harvard  we found a correlation between that ratio and the next 10 years return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you plug in todays pe of about 22 it would be predicting something like an annualized 4 return after inflation</s>
<s>not so bad when you look at the 20year treasury bond yield of 28 and the likely capital losses if interest rates go up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a real 4 return seems like a worthwhile investment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then again i dont know that i trust that number</s>
<s>it goes back to this whole academic literature on the outperformance of equities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my old friend jeremy siegel wharton professor and author of stocks for the long run makes the strongest claim about this</s>
<s>he has data going back 200 years showing that the market has had a real 7 return over that period</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but theres no solid reason it should do so well</s>
<s>things can go for 200 years and then change</s>
<s>i even worry about the 10year pe  even that relationship could break down</s>
<s>but i believe im on better ground thinking that the pe forecasts returns than thinking one asset just always outperforms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>are you saying that theres no reason stocks should outperform bonds at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>oh no</s>
<s>if you go back to textbook finance and make some assumptions about investors risk aversion and that assets should be priced to pay investors for added risk you would get some outperformance for stocks</s>
<s>but not as much as its been it looks as if past high returns were a historical anomaly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so when i said the 10year pe predicts a 4 return thats conditional on past returns being a guide to future returns and the truth is we dont know</s>
<s>maybe it will be only 2</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the sp caseshiller housing index which you helped create recently showed another drop</s>
<s>are you surprised the housing decline has gone on this long</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im not surprised no</s>
<s>there have been long periods when home prices declined including the first half of the 20th century</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the national association of home builders housing market index is sharply up</s>
<s>its a sign of a possible turning point</s>
<s>but theres another side of me that says that the housing market decline hasnt overshot yet really</s>
<s>it could do that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youve argued for changing the home mortgage deduction</s>
<s>why</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are good reasons to promote home ownership  its a way to stake people in citizenship</s>
<s>but i think it makes sense to phase out the home mortgage deduction and instead offer a tax credit which would be worth the same amount to low and highincome taxpayers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many lowincome people dont itemize and claim the mortgage deduction even after they buy a home because the standard deduction looks better to them</s>
<s>even if they do use it the benefit is smaller because theyre in a lower tax bracket</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so were giving a big incentive to highincome people and not much to lowerincome people</s>
<s>why do we give a tax incentive for people to build mcmansions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your new book is called finance and the good society</s>
<s> whats one got to do with the other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finance has become unpopular today  a little like being on campus teaching rotc a generation ago</s>
<s>i wanted to clarify what finance does and remind people it does have a social purpose</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the thing about stock markets and why they have been so successful is that they create a serious playable game</s>
<s>its like gambling but its not</s>
<s>having a stock market provides excitement and lets people think about real things</s>
<s>it was a wonderful invention behaviorally</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so how do you turn that invention to broader social ends</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one problem with philanthropy is that its unrewarding you give away the money and thats it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so as an example of ways to humanize finance i have a notion of a different form of philanthropy that would have shareholders</s>
<s>youre still basically giving away the money but the shares you bought through your donation would pay dividends</s>
<s>and at your discretion you can reinvest them in that company or in another nonprofit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youre just back from an economic conference in europe where policymakers are pushing budget austerity</s>
<s>any lessons we can take from that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres a debate about the merits of austerity among economists</s>
<s>its like a medical judgment we have to deal with the debt eventually</s>
<s>do we let the patient rest before we do the surgery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i think probably austerity is bad at this time</s>
<s>confidence and market psychology are important in promoting consumer spending and growth</s>
<s>the only way we can collectively decide okay we need to spend is to tax and spend</s>
<s>the problem is those words are loaded ideologically  and they raise fears that once spending goes up it wont come down</s>
<s>and thats a legitimate fear</s>
</p>

<s>money magazine is celebrating people both famous and unsung who have done extraordinary work to improve others financial wellbeing</s>
