<p>
<s>all bond prices rise and fall as a result of interestrate changes but junk bonds are also sensitive to something else notes matt conti of fidelity focused high income fund shifts in how investors feel about the ability of the company issuing the bond to repay borrowers</s>
<s>so news that would hit a shaky companys stock — poor earnings say — would hammer its debt too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>junk bonds pay higher interest rates than socalled investmentgrade debt does because their risk of default is higher still over the past year junks default rate has been about 3</s>
<s>today junks 5 to 12 yields are tempting</s>
<s>just keep in mind that if investors sour on the company or the economy junk bond prices can fall sharply — as they did in 2009 when junk bonds fell 26 in value</s>
