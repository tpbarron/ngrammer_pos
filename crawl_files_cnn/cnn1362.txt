<s>are investors rooting for an obama victory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paul dales senior us economist at capital economics turned us on to this fun chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the odds of obama winning in november as estimated by intrade contracts seem to closely track the sp 500</s>
<s>although theres probably not a causal relationship between the two indicators the close correlation seems to indicate obama is expected to be reelected as long as the sp 500 stays above 1200</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>does this mean investors prefer a democrat in the white house</s>
<s>not necessarily</s>
<s>a cnnmoney survey earlier this year showed 70 of investment strategists and money managers believed a republican president will be better for the stock market going forward</s>
<s>other indicators show stocks gain more when a democrat is president</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but coming to any major conclusions about wall streets political preferences seems dubious</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dales points out that the same strong correlation was present during the 2004 election when republican president george w bush was up for reelection</s>
<s>perhaps investors just prefer incumbents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if there is anything to this latest correlation it is probably that the equity markets dont like uncertainty and a victory for the incumbent obama would mean that they know what to expect dales said in a note to clients</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the more probable explanation is that both obamas popularity and the sp 500 are driven primarily by the health of the economy</s>
<s>both come down to how comfortable consumers and investors are feeling about their jobs income housing and inflation on any given day  its as simple as that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>better incoming economic news boosts both the chances of obama being reelected and equity prices dales said</s>
