<s>these funds track the price of silver on the open market with each share typically backed by a specific amount of physical silver held in trust by the fund manager</s>
<s>because they can be instantaneously bought and sold on the market etfs lend themselves to trading</s>

<p>
<s>if youre looking to buy silver in physical form traditionally thats done by buying bullion coins or bars</s>
<s>many prefer the coins such as the american silver eagle or the canadian silver maple</s>
<s>these coins are issued by the us and canadian mints respectively and may be easier to sell than silver bars</s>
