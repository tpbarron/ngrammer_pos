<s>new york cnnmoney  its been a nightmarish three weeks for sony as it struggles to recover from massive hack attacks on three separate gaming systems it runs</s>
<s>not only are the playstation qriocity and sony online gaming networks still offline but tens of millions of credit card numbers may have been stolen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gamers are irate as sony sne works to get its systems back online  and their patience is running out according to brian crecente editor of gaming blog kotaku</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the theme thats bubbling up among our commenters is that theyll be much happier if things are solved today rather than tomorrow crecente says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but sonys timetable for a fix has grown longer in the weeks since the breaches first came to light</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats been hacked sony disclosed the first hack on april 22 saying that an external intrusion on its systems between april 17 and 19 affected its playstation network and its media streaming service qriocity</s>
<s>it pulled the plug on both services on april 20</s>
<s>they remain offline</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then on april 27 sony announced that personal information and perhaps credit card numbers had been stolen in the playstation network and qriocity breaches</s>
<s>that put sensitive details at risk for a whopping 77 million customers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while there is no evidence at this time that credit card data was taken we cannot rule out the possibility sony wrote on its blog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on may 2 things got even worse</s>
<s>another division sony online entertainment took its web services offline after revealing that hackers also gained access to its databases of subscriber information</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sony online entertainment makes online multiplayer games for computers and the playstation 3 including the extremely popular everquest franchise</s>
<s>a company representative says that personal information  but not financial details  from approximately 25 million accounts may have been stolen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hackers may have also obtained financial information for international users from an outdated database from 2007 spokeswoman michele sturdivant says</s>
<s>that includes 12700 nonus credit or debit card numbers and expiration dates as well as 10700 direct debit records for customers in austria germany netherlands and spain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sturdivant says the online division is working around the clock to ensure this is taken care of as soon as possible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>public reaction sony may be piling its resources into a fix but gamers are frustrated that the company took so long to warn them about the potential exposure of their credit cards</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it took five days from the time the service went down to get the yes weve been compromised admission says justin mcelroy reviews editor at gaming blog joystiq</s>
<s>not to put that information in the hands of users was a big misstep</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sony defended the lag in a letter to congress last week saying it took forensic teams time to figure out the depths of the very professional highly sophisticated attack</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>branding expert karen post says sony was right to make sure it had accurate information before it started talking in order to avoid making a confusing situation worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>timing may have seemed slow but brands have to prevent the need for retractions on their statements that reach so many people post says</s>
<s>technology moves so fast that people want answers now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>can sony recover</s>
<s>sonys fate is now tied to what happens to the compromised credit card numbers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if hackers did indeed capture financial information on all 77 million playstation network members it would be one of the biggest heists in history says lowcardscom ceo bill hardekopf</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the record holder is a 2010 hack of payment processor heartland payment systems in which as many as 130 million accounts were stolen hardekopf says</s>
<s>other big heists include the theft of data from 46 million accounts from tj maxx and marshalls in 2007 and 40 million mastercard ma fortune 500 accounts in 2005</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the credit cards were not stolen brian crecente the kotaku editor doesnt think sony will suffer much longterm fallout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people say a lot of things in the heat of the moment but its rare that they actually boycott a brand crecente says</s>
<s>there are things sony could have done better but they didnt do anything malicious</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in an unscientific poll that kotaku posted last week 49 of the 9000 respondents said they liked the sony brand less in light of the hack</s>
<s>but 46 said their opinion didnt change</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>joystiq commenters seem similarly split says the blogs reviews editor justin mcelroy who agrees that most sony fans will come back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but its hard to say if itll be absence makes the heart grow fonder or another nail in the coffin for a company thats never been very good online mcelroy says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and the culprit is </s>
<s>while sony scrambles to fix its current problems and prevent any reoccurrence the company is also trying to figure out whos behind the attack in the first place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sony seems to think its the websiteattacking group anonymous</s>
<s> in its letter to congress last week sony said that it discovered that the intruders had planted a file on one of our sony online entertainment servers named anonymous with the words we are legion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anonymous is a decentralized group that originated on imageboard site 4chanorg</s>
<s>it organizes swarms to try to crash the websites of those it deems enemies</s>
<s>in the past the group has taken down several highprofile sites including those of the motion picture association of america and the recording industry association of america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a purported anonymous news site anonnewsorg posted a statement on april 22 titled for once we didnt do it</s>
<s> but the poster did acknowledge that since anonymous is a decentralized group it could be the case that other anons have acted by themselves  though the group does not take responsibility as a whole for whatever has happened</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still sony had reason to be suspicious</s>
<s>sonys letter to congress last week pointed out that the company recently landed in anonymous crosshairs for suing two people who were distributing instructions on how to hack a playstation 3 game system  and then going after the details on anyone who ever viewed the instructions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whether the attacker was a profitminded cyberthief or a pissedoff hacktivist sony  and its fans  are clearly hurting</s>
<s>right now i am suffering from withdrawal so bad one everquest 2 player moaned on a forum where gamers gathered to commiserate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another fan site kicked off a discussion of what players are doing to fill their empty hours</s>
<s>one response studying for my final exams</s>
<s>perhaps this downtime is a good thing for me</s>
