<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>obama in his latest budget the president proposed spending roughly $58 trillion on the pentagons base budget over the next decade</s>
<s>in 2022 that means defense would account for roughly 11 of total federal spending</s>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<s>romney also has proposed setting the pentagons annual base budget  before additional spending on wars  at a minimum of 4 of gdp</s>
<s>that means he could spend roughly $8 trillion on defense over the next decade or about $2 trillion more than obama has proposed</s>
<s>its also $16 trillion more relative to policies under current law  an increase he has promised to pay for with other spending cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his goal he said is making sure that we have a military so strong that no one in the world would ever want to test it</s>
<s>and that suggests to me a commitment in the range of 4 percent of gdp is the right level</s>
