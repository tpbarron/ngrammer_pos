<s>my mom wants to invest $60000 for her grandkids ages 4 to 11 to get at age 25</s>
<s>how should she do it — jill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>her simplest investment option is to put the $60000 in a lowcost balanced fund such as one from the money 70</s>
<s>then she should insert a bequest in her will identifying the grandkids as equal beneficiaries of the fund says new york estateplanning attorney lynne stebbins</s>
<s>specify that if the kids are under 25 when she dies the money should be held in a testamentary trust until they reach that age</s>
<s>the cost of getting an estateplanning attorney to do this $500 to $1000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a cheaper setup if your mom is willing to let the kids have the money sooner is for her to open an utma uniform transfer to minors act account for each theyll get the money at age 18 in 10 states or 21</s>
