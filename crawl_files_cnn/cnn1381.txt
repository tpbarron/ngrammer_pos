</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the days of stinky litter boxes could be coming to an end</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>seven years ago rebecca rescate 32 put together a kit that helps train cats to use the toilet called citikitty</s>
<s>and now her company  which has made $700000 in sales so far  is projected to hit $1 million in revenues by yearend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>talk about a royal flush</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this week rescate will appear on the abc show shark tank for the second time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the show produced by mark burnett known for survivor and the apprentice has entrepreneurs trying to persuade five wealthy business people called sharks to invest in their businesses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>during her may 13 appearance kevin harington invested $100000 in citikitty for a return of 20 equity</s>
<s>but the publicity caused her sales to spike  bringing in $350000 that month alone</s>
<s>the demand forced rescate to hire six temporary parttime workers to keep up with orders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>citikitty which retails for $2498 helps to transition cats away from the litter box</s>
<s>the product  which consists of a series of trays  is filled with litter and inserted underneath the toilet seat and over the mouth of the commode</s>
<s>the first tray is solid but the followup trays have holes of increasing size in the center of them which means the tray and the litter over time disappear</s>
<s>in the end the cat is using the toilet without a tray or litter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most people were introduced to a toiletusing cat in meet the parents the 2000 comedy starring robert de niro and ben stiller</s>
<s>in that movie de niros character owned a himalayan cat named mr jinx who squats on the toilet and relieves himself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the image was startling but intriguing for many litterboxcleaning cat owners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cats are the numberone companion animal and with that regard theres a huge market said jason merithew a spokesman at the american animal hospital association who admits hes thought about springing for a toilettraining kit for his cat mostly to avoid cleaning the litter box</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from the pethealth side of things its very important to clean out the litter box daily</s>
<s>if its a dirty litter box it could cause some issues where the cat might not want to go in there and start relieving themselves elsewhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while sharing a cramped manhattan apartment with her husband rescate got the idea for citikitty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you barely have enough room for your winter jacket let alone a litter box said rescate</s>
<s>so she got rid of her litter box filled a roasting pan with cat litter and placed it inside her toilet</s>
<s>soon samantha their 11yearold cat was hopping up on the toilet to do her business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i knew from the first moment samantha tinkled that there would be millions of other people who would want to do this she said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two similar products  one cost $100 and the other lacked clear directions  left plenty of room for her adaptation she said</s>
<s>howto videos are published on citikittycom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rescate who studied business and graphicdesign in college before working at a softwaredevelopment company always enjoyed product design</s>
<s>while her highschool classmates read novels on the beach rescate stuck her nose into books about corporate branding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even so the transition to being an entrepreneur was not easy</s>
<s>i hadnt launched a product before and i felt i had a lot to learn said rescate</s>
<s>i was extremely fortunate in that it has one of those headturning wow factors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after putting down $20000 of her own money  used mostly for website design and graphic design while her family loaned warehouse space  citikitty was profitable within 30 days thanks to low overhead</s>
<s>this summer she moved the business out of her home just north of philadelphia</s>
<s>she also hired her first employee last fall</s>
<s>she chose a manufacturing company close to home to keep an eye on the process</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the last thing you want is to do this large run in china you sign off on it and when it gets here in a container its all wrong said rescate</s>
<s>my manufacturer is located 30 minutes from me and so i know everything thats going on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>soon the kit will be sold in select walgreens outlets its already been available through citikittycom walmartcom about 200 pet stores nationwide and several online marketplaces devoted to pet products</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>she didnt stop there</s>
<s>in meet the parents mr jinx didnt know how to flush</s>
<s>and rescate  always on the lookout for other business opportunities  came up with a companion product to her toilettraining kit to remedy this problem an automatic toilet flusher activated by a motionsensor $189</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>she also recently rolled out a line of cat treats bonito flakes made from skipjack tuna fished in asia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ive never seen a cat go so crazy for a treat she saidÂ </s>
