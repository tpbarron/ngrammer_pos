<s>so whats the secret to his success</s>
<s>harrison shares his tips on finding fame and fortune</s>
<s>here are edited excerpts from the interview below</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>set yourself apart</s>
<s>as a small business owner with big competition we had to figure out a way to be different</s>
<s>we saw an opportunity to invite people to sell their rare and unusual items at our shop in addition to conducting our usual pawn business</s>
<s>now when the big corporate pawn shops get an item they dont recognize they send the customer to us</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>know how to negotiate</s>
<s>never fall in love with something when youre negotiating a price</s>
<s>never decide youre going to buy something because you cant live without it</s>
<s>negotiating to buy an item shouldnt be an emotional process</s>
<s>and you should never ever give the first number</s>
<s>as a buyer you dont want to risk coming in first with a high price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>offer something no one else does</s>
<s>in the 90s i went on ebay to buy some paddle tires for my fourwheeler atv and couldnt find any</s>
<s>when i did find a manufacturer that sold them i bought 20000 and had no problem reselling them</s>
<s>so the next time you get mad when you cant find an item realize theres a market waiting to be explored</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>treat every customer well</s>
<s>i tell everyone that works for me not to look down on people</s>
<s>if youre nice to people and take a minute to talk with them its good for business whether or not they buy anything</s>
<s>just because they dont look like they have money doesnt mean theyre poor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once an unkempt elderly woman came into the pawn shop</s>
<s>she appeared homeless and she insisted on seeing every piece of expensive jewelry in the store</s>
<s>just when i was feeling impatient the woman pointed at the most expensive piece of jewelry and said ill take that one</s>
<s> then she proceeded to pull $4000 out of her sock to pay for it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>embrace social media</s>
<s>after pawn stars became popular we began selling a lot of tshirts and swag promotional items in the store</s>
<s>a year ago i decided that rather than having our tshirts professionally designed we should hold a competition on facebook and ask our fans for design ideas</s>
<s>for every design we choose to go on a shirt the winner receives $250 and a box of swag</s>
<s>as a result were receiving hundreds of design ideas and have saved over $100000 on producing tshirts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we also pay someone to do regular facebook status and twitter updates</s>
<s>corey and chumlee have been getting paid $1000 a night to appear at different nightclubs</s>
<s>club owners know that once they start tweeting their location for the night hundreds of people show up to see themÂ </s>
