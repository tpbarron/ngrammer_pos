<s>money magazine  last year the economic forecasting firm fiserv predicted that home values would sink around 5 in 2011 and that prices in threequarters of the nations major metro areas would fall</s>
<s>the bad news is the firm wasnt that far off the mark</s>
<s>the good news in the coming year fiserv thinks 95 of the 384 metro areas it tracks will see prices rise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont expect the market to move much beyond first gear though</s>
<s>the median expectation among more than 100 economists and real estate pros surveyed by macromarkets is that home values will inch ahead by a mere 025 compared to their 2011 median forecast decline of 28</s>
<s>they also foresee annualized gains through 2015 of just 11 as the real estate market slowly works its way through a mountain of foreclosures</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those foreclosures will continue to weigh on the market</s>
<s>according to core logic there are 54 million homes that are for sale or part of the markets shadow inventory  which includes bankowned properties homes in the foreclosure pipeline that havent hit the market yet or properties where owners are seriously behind on payments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to put that in perspective freddie mac forecasts that only 48 million homes will be purchased in all of 2012</s>
<s>a market with six months of inventory is considered healthy</s>
<s>that theres more than a years worth of housing stock now tells you what a tough slog this will still be</s>
<s>its analogous to a flood says mark fleming corelogics chief economist</s>
<s>the water is very deep in the living room but its no longer getting deeper and is starting to recede</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>helping that process along will be lowinterestrate mortgages that are expected to remain cheap</s>
<s>jay brinkmann chief economist at the mortgage bankers association says the 42 rate on a 30year fixed rate in late october might not last long</s>
<s>still he expects the 30year fixed mortgage rate to stay below 5 throughout 2012</s>

<s>the action plan it will pay to think small  as in reduce your mortgage bills and focus on modest homes</s>
<s>buyers downsize the dream</s>
<s>for those gearing up to make a purchase 2012 could be a great opportunity what with cheap prices low borrowing rates and little competition among prospective bidders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before you take the plunge remember that the price you pay matters as does your ability to easily resell that home down the road</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this means its best to focus on smaller properties in your area near restaurants and retail</s>
<s>mcmansions of at least 2600 square feet which were the ideal in the boom years are coveted by a mere 18 of households today according to a recent survey by trulia</s>
<s>and that figure could fall even more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a separate survey by the national association of home builders found that homeconstruction firms expect us houses to average 2152 square feet in 2015  down 10 from last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some of this is attributable to the lingering effects of the past recession which has eaten into housing budgets</s>
<s>but theres also a permanent change at play</s>
<s>baby boomers are trading down</s>
<s>they dont need the mcmansion and they dont want to drive as much says trulia chief economist jed kolko</s>

<p>
<s>sellers price it right</s>
<s>the longer you can wait for prices to stabilize in your area and for demand to pick up the less likely youll need to entertain lowball offers</s>
<s>if you have to make a move in 2012 though the trick will be to price your home correctly out of the gate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to a recent national survey of real estate agents 75 of homeowners believe their house is worth more than what agents put the fair market value at and nearly one in two homeowners still overestimate their homes value by more than 10</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile trulia reports that about one in four homes in its database has gone through at least one price reduction and the average price cut for those homes is 8</s>

<p>
<s>joe magdziarz president of the appraisal institute says you and your agent should stick with comparable sales data just within the past 90 days as thats what lenders expect appraisers to use</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you dont trust your agents recommendation shell out $300 to $400 for an outside appraisal</s>
<s>that will be money well spent if it pushes you to list your home in sync with current market valuations and you sell faster</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>owners shorten your loan</s>
<s>refinancing your old mortgage to a new fixedrate loan could have you smiling for years to come</s>
<s>if theres any chance you can refinance into a 15year loan go for it the 345 rate in late october was near an alltime low</s>
<s>on a $250000 mortgage going from a 30year mortgage at 42 to a 15year loan charging 345 would save you $120000 in interest over the life of the loan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what if the added $560 monthly payment is too steep to handle</s>
<s>shop for a 20year loan</s>
<s>the rate is likely to be only slightly less than on a 30year loan but the faster payback will save you in the long run</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cant refinance because you dont have the 20 equity lenders typically demand these days</s>
<s>as long as you plan on being in your home for at least five years look into a cashin refinancing where you bring some money to the closing table to push up your equity</s>
