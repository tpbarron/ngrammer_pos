<s>as for whether stocks represent a good value now the picture is decidedly mixed</s>
<s>a conservative measure of price earnings ratios  which relies on 10 years of averaged earnings  would suggest equities are too expensive to load up on</s>

<s>at that paltry level a fraction of a percentage point increase in rates could wipe out what little your bonds are yielding  and then some</s>
