<s>new york money  i know that immediate income annuities pay a monthly check for life in exchange for a lump sum upfront</s>
<s>but their payments are based on the claimspaying ability of the insurance company behind the annuity</s>
<s>how can i be sure the insurer will make good on its guarantee and that i can count on the annuitys income well into the future when ill be most vulnerable</s>

<p>
<s>whenever an investment comes with a guarantee  whether its an annuity a mutual fund or given the debt limit tussle weve just been through even a us treasury security  you need to know two things what exactly is being guaranteed and what stands behind that guarantee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the case of an immediate annuity whats being guaranteed is an income stream usually a monthly payment for life</s>
<s>there are lots of variations however</s>
<s>for example you can get income for the rest of your life or for as long as either you or your spouse remains alive the jointandsurvivor income option</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can also stipulate that you wish to receive income for life but that a minimum number of payments are made</s>
<s>the life with 10 years certain option for example assures that the annuity makes payments for 10 years or as long as you live whichever is longer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you die two years after buying the annuity your beneficiary would receive payments another eight years</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>its also possible to get immediate annuities with costofliving adjustments that tie increases to the consumer price index or boost them by a set percentage say 3 or 5 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for what stands behind an immediate annuitys guarantee there is as you noted the claimspaying ability of the insurer</s>
<s>that depends on among other things the reserves the insurer has set aside for annuities life insurance policies and other obligations as well as the insurers capital or surplus as its called in insurance circles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since most individual investors dont have the time expertise or inclination to pore over insurers financial statements they rely on the ratings of firms such as am best and standard  poors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but theres another backstop state guaranty associations</s>
<s>these organizations step in should an insurer find itself unable to meet its obligations</s>
<s>the safety net these associations provide can differ from state to state and also vary depending on what type of policy you own annuity whole life etc</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so back to your question how can you be sure an annuitys income will be there when you need it</s>
<s>well you can never be absolutely 100 sure</s>
<s>no investment us treasury bills included is totally without risk</s>
<s>but you can take precautions to bring that risk down to a manageable or reasonable level</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to do that i recommend you do the following four things</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first stick to insurers that are highly rated generally id say a or better from major ratings firms</s>
<s>yes i know these ratings are far from infallible witness the mortgage securities that collapsed contributing to the financial crisis</s>
<s>but would it make sense to ignore the ratings or do business with an insurer that these firms consider weak</s>
<s>i dont think so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second diversify</s>
<s>just as it makes sense to spread your money among a variety of stocks and bonds to mitigate the risk of a company imploding its also prudent to spread whatever money youre planning to put into an immediate annuity among the offerings of two or three highlyrated insurers</s>
<s>that way all of your income isnt riding on the fortunes of one company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third limit the amount you invest with any single insurer to the maximum coverage offered by the guaranty association in your state</s>
<s>that limit is typically $100000 or more for annuities but you can find the max for your state by clicking here</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally dont put all of your retirement savings in an annuity immediate or otherwise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just as you dont want your retirement security riding on the fortunes of a single insurance company you also dont want it tied solely to one type of investment</s>
<s>even aside from safety concerns there are other valid reasons liquidity and growth potential to name two you want to have a retirement income strategy that combines several different types of assets and investments</s>
<s>for more on how to create such a strategy click here</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so before you buy an annuity or any other investment because you like the idea of a guarantee make sure you understand whats being guaranteed and whos doing the guaranteeing</s>
<s>and be sure to take the precautions i listed above</s>
