<s>rsa executive chairman arthur coviello spoke about rsas massive data breach last year in his opening keynote at rsas annual cybersecurity conference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>san francisco cnnmoney  this past years wave of highprofile extremely sophisticated cyberattacks are a watershed moment for the security field according to rsa chief arthur coviello</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people in our line of work have been going through hell in the past 12 months coviello said during his kickoff keynote for rsas 2012 conference one of the largest annual gatherings of us cybersecurity professionals</s>
<s>our networks will be penetrated</s>
<s>we should no longer be surprised by this</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>coviello was speaking from personal experience</s>
<s>in march rsa was among the victims of a massive cyberattack that targeted hundreds of major american companies and government agencies</s>
<s>the attackers breached rsas systems and made off with information that rsa said could reduce the effectiveness of its widely used securid authentication system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the hackers who have not yet been publicly identified then used information obtained from rsa to mount an attack on defense contractor lockheed martin lmt fortune 500</s>
<s>that kind of painstaking campaign  known in the industry as an advanced persistent threat  marks an escalation in the cybersecurity arms race coviello said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>never have the attacks been as targeted with the aim of breaching one organization as a stepping stone to breaching others he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>coviello dealt quickly with the elephant in the room acknowledging rsas black eye over the breach  one of the largest in terms of the number of clients put at risk through a vendors vulnerability</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my colleagues and i feel this as personally as everyone in this room he told the crowd of thousands</s>
<s>since the breach weve been dedicated to regaining and maintaining your confidence in us</s>
<s>we have a sense of urgency as never before</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but for companies to protect their most critical systems they have to fundamentally overhaul their approach according to rsa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>online security has traditionally been about building the biggest fiercest defenses possible to keep attackers out</s>
<s>thats not enough</s>
<s>now you have to assume youve been compromised and invest just as heavily in detection</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>less than 5 of cybersecurity breaches are discovered within hours according to the latest edition of verizons threat report the industrys most comprehensive annual study</s>
<s>almost 80 werent found for weeks  or months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rsa a unit of emc corp emc fortune 500 is practicing what it now preaches</s>
<s>the breach changed the companys approach from defend to defend and detect rsa chief technology officer bret hartman told cnnmoney in an earlier interview</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a shift in the level of paranoia to assume that youre always in a state of partial compromise hartman said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>companies have some options for adjusting to that reality including deploying a new wave of monitoring tools aimed at finding breaches and reconstructing the data trail of what has disappeared through them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but they also need to change how they approach the new threat landscape</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we need to tap more military experience and military intelligence experience coviello said</s>
<s>the new breed of analysts im talking about need to be offensive in their mindset</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he said that level of expertise is needed to counter the mounting attacks from criminals hacktivists and irresponsible nation states  a direct dig at china which security researchers view as one of the largest and most potent cyberespionage threats</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reality today is that we are in a race with our adversaries coviello said</s>
<s>and right now more often than not they are winning</s>
