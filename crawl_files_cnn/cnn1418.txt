<p>
<s>what worries you the most when you wake up every day</s>
<s> swisher asked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you hear about companies getting long in the tooth hastings said</s>
<s>all of these innovations are going on every day all around you</s>
<s>one day someone could overtake you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the surface netflix doesnt appear to have any major competitors to its mix of video streaming and dvd rental</s>
<s>swisher asked hastings whether he felt threatened by amazon amzn fortune 500 google goog fortune 500 or apple aapl fortune 500</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our major competitor is going to be cable and satellite companies switching to a tv everywhere model hastings said</s>
<s>eventually they will be bundling that kind of video into a package</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>swisher expressed doubt noting that big cable companies have been pretty slow to integrate online streaming video</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre still a formidable competitor  its a huge industry hastings replied</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he reiterated his past comments about netflixs lack of current season tv or newer movies saying that all that new stuff is expensive so you cant have that at just $8 a month</s>
<s> at a conference last month hastings said going after that type of content would spark world war iii with cable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still hastings said netflix nflx would like to work out a deal with hbo and showtime to get earlier season content</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>swisher asked why that wasnt possible</s>
<s>hastings shot back checks not big enough yet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>international expansion netflix launched in canada late last year  though its been somewhat stymied by the countrys severe bandwidth caps  and it has plans for two more new markets</s>

<p>
<s>we tell investors that the better we do internationally the more money well lose because well invest more hastings said</s>
<s>in canada we think well be profitable within a year of launch</s>
<s>china is tough for us but korea india japan  those would be great</s>

<p>
<s>netflix would have existing competitors in some of those markets hastings said</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>social component coming during a qa session an audience member at d9 asked hastings why netflix lacks a social component</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there should be hastings replied</s>
<s>we launched netflix friends in 2005 to try to build our own private social network</s>
<s>but in two or three years we learned as many companies did that people dont want vendorbyvendor networks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead hastings said customers prefer to use facebook for socializing across the internet</s>
<s>netflix is working on a facebook integration he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beyond the internet hastings discussed the limitations of video on mobile devices small screens and he said laptops still make up the largest share of netflix use</s>
<s>but he said the company is agnostic about devices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its more an internet service on every device he said</s>
<s>we want customers to be able to access it whenever they want it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and devices arent all that will evolve hastings said</s>
<s>the very fabric of the internet is changing and it may become obsolete itself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>something will eventually replace the internet he said</s>
<s>but is that in 10 years 100 or 500</s>
<s>its incredibly hard to imagine</s>
<s>its like asking our ancestors on horses to imagine a car</s>
