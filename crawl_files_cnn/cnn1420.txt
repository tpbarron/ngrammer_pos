<s>severe bandwidth caps in canada make streaming video very expensive  leading to big losses for netflix</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  netflixs first foray into international markets has been rough</s>
<s>why</s>
<s>blame canada</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thanks to some new  and severe  bandwidth caps by canadian telecoms and cable companies streaming video is very expensive for our northern neighbors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>canadian internet service providers began rolling out payasyougo data plans in 2008 in which customers pay out the nose if they go over their allotted limits</s>
<s>but things got even worse last september when canadian regulators approved a strict usagebased billing plan from top telco bell canada bce</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>within the last year bell and other major isps including rogers communications rci drastically cut the bandwidth allowances on their plans</s>
<s>many customers are now capped at about 25 gigabytes per month</s>
<s>additional data can cost $1 or more per gb</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some canadian data plans offer as little as 2 gb which is enough to stream just two hours of standardquality video  an obvious nightmare for netflix which launched in canada late last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>edward williams research analyst at bmo capital markets says bandwidth caps are a top concern for netflix right now especially if us firms follow suit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cable companies who are losing customers to netflix are also the toll takers when it comes to bandwidth williams points out</s>
<s>thats an extremely important dynamic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact data caps already made their way stateside in march courtesy of att and comcast cmcsa fortune 500  albeit at a much more generous level than canadian plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>att t fortune 500 limited its uverse customers  who subscribe to its highspeed broadband television and telephone network  to 250 gigabytes of internet usage each month</s>
<s>each additional 50 gb beyond the limit costs $10</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heavy international losses in 2011 netflixs growing pains in canada seem to have even caught the company by surprise</s>
<s>netflix nflx ended the first quarter with about 800000 canadian subscribers which came in at the low end of company forecasts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>netflix also said in january that it expected $50 million in operating losses in the second half of the year from its international business</s>
<s>but in its firstquarter earnings release last month it revised that forecast to between $50 million and $70 million in losses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>netflix said it was comfortable with the losses given the size of the opportunity</s>
<s> but a large portion of last quarters earnings report was devoted to explaining the canada situation</s>
<s>netflix called the pergigabyte fees excessive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the company also noted that in march it changed the default setting for canadian netflix customers to a lowerquality video that consumes 9 gb for 30 hours of viewing versus 3070 gb for 30 hours</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>netflix has to roll with the punches here says williams</s>
<s>their compressed data workaround did help and theyre simply going to have to work within the confines that the isps providers put on them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and canada is a great testing ground williams adds</s>
<s>its similar to the us market and the situation has forced netflix to come up with datacap solutions before it continues to expand internationally</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>netflix plans to expand even more for all of its concerns about still learning the seasonality curve and nuances specific to canada as netflix said in its earnings release the company also revealed it is planning to soon move into two more international markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while netflix is spending more on international markets than analysts had predicted williams said its money well spent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other countries netflix doesnt have the same brand awareness that it does in the us williams says</s>
<s>they need to be first to market and focused with a strategy that theyre pursuing aggressively</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the international concerns havent dented netflixs meteoric stock rise</s>
<s>shares are up 140 over the last 12 months and 37 in 2011 aloneÂ </s>
