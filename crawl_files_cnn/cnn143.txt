<p>
<s>sorry but neither i nor anyone else can give you a norisk way to invest $500000 or any other sum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all investing involves taking some form of risk even if its not apparent</s>
<s>and while you may be able to sidestep one threat by choosing a particular type of investment you will still leave yourself open to a different kind of danger</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres an example</s>
<s>when investors say they want a low or norisk investment they typically mean they want to protect the value of their principal and any interest or other investment earnings</s>
<s>even if the economy and the markets go kerflooey they want to know their account balance wont drop</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that assurance is easy to get</s>
<s>just put your $500000 in fdicinsured savings accounts</s>
<s>as long as you spread your money among several banks or otherwise take care that federal deposit insurance will fully cover principal and interest you can rest easy</s>
<s>fdic insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the us government after all</s>
<s>so unless you envision some sort of apocalypse that would force uncle sam to renege on his obligations you dont have to worry about losing a cent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however since bank accounts treasury bills and comparable cashequivalents are so secure they typically pay relatively modest returns</s>
<s>their annual yields have been particularly low the past year or so well below 1 on average</s>
<s>by keeping your dough in such accounts youre virtually guaranteeing youll earn a very low rate of return</s>
<s>and that leaves you vulnerable to other risks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example if youre still investing for a retirement thats some years down the road keeping your savings in lowyield investments could so stunt the longterm growth of your nest egg that you would have difficulty maintaining your standard of living in retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related ground rules for retirement investing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>conversely if youre nearing or have already entered retirement and are counting on withdrawals from your $500000 to pay living expenses a meager return on your savings would force you to keep those withdrawals to a very modest level  say an initial 2 to 3 of your portfolios value or about $10000 to $15000 which you would then increase by the inflation rate each year to maintain purchasing power</s>
<s>pull out more and you would run a very high risk of running out of money early in retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can protect yourself against the risk of earning inadequate returns by investing your 500 grand in a diversified blend of stock and bond funds</s>
<s>theres no guarantee but over the long run youre likely to earn several percentage points more a year than you would in bank accounts and similar safe investments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the 20 years to the beginning of this year for example stocks and bonds beat cash equivalents by 46 and 31 percentage points a year respectively</s>
<s>so the odds are good that divvying up your money between stock and bond funds will leave you with a larger nest egg when youre ready to retire  and allow you to draw more without running through your savings too early</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by owning stocks and bonds however youre leaving yourself open to the danger that your savings will take a hit in the shortterm</s>
<s>during the severe market downturn in 2008 for example even a conservative portfolio of 50 stocks and 50 bonds would have lost 16</s>
<s>granted such a portfolio would have recouped nearly all of that loss the next year</s>
<s>but for someone concerned about the security of his savings a 16 drop could be pretty unnerving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i could go on and on with other types of risk but you get the idea</s>
<s>no investment can act as an impregnable shield that protects you from all possible harm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given that reality how should you invest your $500000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>start by realizing that while you cant totally eliminate all threats you can at least gain some protection by taking on several different risks simultaneously</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youll no doubt want to have money set aside in a secure place so it will be available in full no matter what happens in the market</s>
<s>but unless you plan on spending all your savings in the next few years you dont have to put it all in such a secure place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so figure out how much youll need to tap over the next couple of years  $50000 $100000 whatever  and invest that amount in an fdicinsured account</s>
<s>that way youll have access to the money youll really need in the short term without subjecting the whole shebang to the prospect of anemic longterm returns</s>
</p>

<s>related should i quit my job and travel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since you wont need the rest of your dough immediately you can afford to take more risk and shoot for higher returns</s>
<s>if youre investing all or most of the remaining amount for retirement you can divvy it up between stock and bond funds depending on how far you are from retirement</s>
<s>if retirement is still a couple of decades or more away you might want to invest say 70 or so in stock funds and 30 in bond funds</s>
<s>such a mix will get whacked during market setbacks but your savings will have plenty of time to bounce back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if retirement is much closer or youre already retired stability is a higher priority although youll still want some growth</s>
<s>so you may want to scale back your stock exposure to say 50 or even less and keep the rest of your portfolio in bonds</s>
<s>this will give your nest egg more of a cushion should the stock market head south</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line you cant eliminate all risk when investing and the more you focus on avoiding just one peril the more vulnerable youll be to others</s>
<s>by diversifying smartly you should be able to protect yourself adequately against a variety of risks and lower the chances that any single threat will do your portfolio in</s>
