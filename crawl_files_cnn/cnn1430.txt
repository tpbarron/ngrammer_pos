<p>
<s>money magazine  the ease of investing in a targetdate fund doesnt mean you should just set it and forget it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as discussed in our companion article the truth behind target date funds these allinone retirement portfolios have a wide variety of strategies stock bets and costs</s>
<s>so be on the lookout for these three things</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>you can find yourself taking more risk than you should</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even after the losses of 2008 the three biggest targetdate providers  fidelity t rowe price and vanguard  have at least half their holdings in equities within a few years of retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none follow the old rule of thumb promoted by vanguard founder john bogle that you should hold your age in bonds and the rest in equities</s>
<s>thats hardly scientific but it lines up with what many investors expect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to a survey commissioned by the securities and exchange commission more than half of targetfund owners believe a fund will hold less than 40 in stocks at the target date</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>funds in general may have an incentive to favor equities</s>
<s>if risk usually pays off in better performance that can make the fund easier to sell</s>
<s>still the big providers havent been pure performance chasers none swung to big bond stakes after the crash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the managers of those funds also make a case for equities that isnt so easy to dismiss</s>
<s>with traditional pensions disappearing the 401k has to solve a big problem how to make a finite  and for most americans tiny  nest egg provide a decent income for a possibly very long retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for a mutual fund the high potential return from equities is the main tool at hand to solve that problem even if its a far from perfect one</s>
<s>whats more says jerome clark manager of the t rowe price targetdate funds stocks look like an even better value relative to bonds now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in designing a targetdate funds glide path  the schedule it follows for gradually reducing its equity stake  firms typically run simulations to determine the range of possible risk and return with a focus on finding a strategy that offers you the best chance of not outliving your money</s>
<s>when you focus on that risk of a shortfall you get a counterintuitive result portfolio mixes that are volatile appear safer and the ones that are less volatile look risky</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is especially true for people who havent saved enough or who make big withdrawals at retirement</s>
<s>for example t rowe price calculates that a retiree who takes out an initial 6 of savings in year one and then increases that amount annually by the rate of inflation has less than a 50 chance of making the money last 30 years with 20 in equity and 80 in bonds</s>
<s>raise the equity exposure to 60 though and the chance of the moneys lasting rises to over 60</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem is that a riskier portfolio always carries the possibility of a huge loss</s>
<s>things that dont happen 99 of the time can still happen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2007 vanguard published research on glide path design showing what a hypothetical targetdate fund with strategies similar to vanguards could do</s>
<s>it declined by an annual 16 or more in 1 of their market performance simulations</s>
<s>the real vanguard 2010 fund lost 26 from march 2008 through february 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>doesnt investing over decades shelter you from shortterm risk</s>
<s>not necessarily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over long time frames the probability of losing money goes down but the magnitude of what you can lose increases explains moshe milevsky professor of finance at york university in toronto</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>young investors can have more in equities says milevsky because they can offset stock volatility with their human capital  that is the income they can earn over a career</s>
<s>once youve stopped working and begin spending assets you lose some of your ability to simply ride out market volatility</s>
<s>hitting a bear market early on is especially damaging</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>john ameriks head of vanguards investment counseling and research group agrees that retirees falling human capital calls for taking less risk</s>
<s>still social security is a form of human capital and your ability to earn doesnt go to zero when you turn 65</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were seeing people step out only to come back in a consulting role says ameriks</s>
<s>thats why vanguards glide path doesnt hit its lowest risk until 72</s>
<s>though that makes sense it also suggests that if you are set on not working or know you cant after 65 vanguards glide path may be too bullish for you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>managers of more conservative targetdate funds focus on what can happen right around the target</s>
<s>were trying to avoid material setbacks closer to retirement says jim lauder comanager of the wells fargo target series whose 2015 fund has less than a third of assets in stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>imagine you lose 30 of $1 million as you retire</s>
<s>if you were planning to turn that into an incomeproducing annuity your earnings would have fallen from $69000 a year to $49000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what to do adjust your aim</s>
<s>no matter what model a targetdate manager is using its only that a model</s>
<s>in real life if your savings are just about enough to produce the income you need you might want to focus on preserving capital</s>
<s>with a bigger cushion a pension or plans to keep working it could make sense to stay aggressive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>targetdate funds dont rebalance relative to your goal just relative to stocks and bonds says zvi bodie a professor of finance at boston university who advocates a safetyfocused retirement strategy</s>
<s>hes also a paid speaker for dimensional fund advisors which sells a competing 401k product</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 2008 crash provided a vivid example of how hard a targetdate fund can fall</s>
<s>so check how a fund for people five years older than you did in 2008</s>
<s>thats roughly what you could expect to experience if the same thing happened today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ask yourself if thats a loss you could handle  both psychologically and in terms of your plans</s>
<s>if the risk seems too great scale back buy a more conservative targetdate fund in your plan  one with an earlier retirement date in its name  or add a bond fund to your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>although theres a variety of investing strategies you usually get one choice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even among the targetdate managers who think retirees can bear a fair amount of market risk theres a wide variety of glide paths</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>t rowe price holds about 64 in stocks near retirement fidelity is closer to 50</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>differences become even more pronounced later</s>
<s>the vanguard glide path settles down to 30 seven years after retirement but t rowe price doesnt get to that point for 20 years and then keeps cutting back on stocks until hitting 20 at the 30year mark</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a few decades youll know who made the smartest bet</s>
<s>but the bet you end up making will depend on which funds your company uses in its plan notes boston college economist pierluigi balduzzi who has studied the funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a result of the hearings that followed the 2008 crash the sec and the labor department have proposed rules to require targetdate funds to spell out the risk they are taking</s>
<s>yet the whole point of targetdate funds is that they are supposed to make decisionmaking easier by narrowing your options to one choice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>asked if it might make sense to buy a fund with an earlier target date if you want less risk t rowe prices clark says it would but that he doesnt see it happening often</s>
<s>most folks dont know what their risk tolerance is and most are not going to take the action because of inertia he says</s>
<s>throw in one decision and you may lose them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what to do take back the wheel</s>
<s>in your early and midcareer going on autopilot with whatever your company offers can work out fine</s>
<s>most targetdate funds have a similar highequity strategy for young investors</s>
<s>with many years of 401k contributions ahead you can recover from even large market dips</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>late in your career though you need a real financial plan</s>
<s>robert pozen a former president of fidelitys fundmanagement group has argued that all these precisely plotted glide paths may suggest to investors that targetdate funds are more sophisticated and customized than they really are</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hed rather see investors defaulted into a 60 stock40 bond balanced fund and then encouraged to decide based on their own situations how much to hold in stocks late in their careers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you have to make one important financial decision in your entire life and thats between the ages of 50 and 60 says pozen</s>
<s>you can consult a financial planner for this or your company may offer an advice service or tools that can help</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example financial engines provides 401k plans with sophisticated online simulators that show the effects of different portfolio mixes savings rate and retirement dates</s>
<s>if your company doesnt offer such a service you can pay $39 for three months of access at financialenginescom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>high costs can wipe out any edge you get from a pro tinkering with your mix</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for all of the fund industrys talk about behavioral blind spots most of the business has been silent on another common investment error the belief that you can easily find managers who can beat the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some targetdate funds  most notably vanguards  use just three or four index funds</s>
<s>many others seek an edge by combining a number of the firms own actively managed funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fidelity for example owns 23 other fidelity funds in its 2020 target portfolio</s>
<s>thats partly because it offers more asset classes such as commodities and real estate</s>
<s>it also has 10 us stock funds nine of which are actively managed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fidelitys managers say that having so many funds means they can find the best ideas within each distinct slice of the market</s>
<s>but its tough enough to find one marketbeating manager much less nine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>smaller firms are becoming even more complex</s>
<s>putnams targetdate lineup which is conservative with a low exposure to stocks takes an exotic turn by investing in socalled absolutereturn funds which can invest in almost anything including bets on a stock to decline</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres a chance such strategies could improve performance</s>
<s>christopher davis an analyst at morningstar says its not easy to tell which targetdate managers are adding value in part because of funds differing glide paths</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a sure bet however that active strategies will add costs</s>
<s>vanguards indexed offerings charge management fees of 018 a year t rowe price and the main fidelity freedom series cost about 07</s>
<s>some of the smaller fund groups cost 1 or more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sounds small but a study by towers watson found that for an 8 saver earning $75000 a year the lifetime difference between a 02 and a 1 targetdate fund could add up to almost nine years of retirement income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the targetdate business exists very much under the umbrella of government</s>
<s>you can invest outside a 401k but the tax and employermatching incentives mean youd probably be crazy not to contribute</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given that and uncle sams willingness to bless target funds as default investments why not go further and say that the funds should resemble say the lowcost plan federal workers get</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rep george miller dcalif has proposed requiring plans to offer at least one index fund</s>
<s>but in general lawmakers and regulators have been reluctant to single out index funds or cheap funds as better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont think its appropriate for the government to substitute for the judgment of the fiduciary the employer says bradford campbell a former deputy secretary of labor who helped craft the default rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what to do build a cheaper model</s>
<s>constructing your own portfolio of a stock fund a bond fund and an international fund can be worth the trouble if your plan offers an actively managed target fund charging 07 a year and a menu of index funds at 02</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and dont get hung up on a fancy glide path</s>
<s>a 2008 study by researchers at the boston college center for retirement research found that paying an extra 02 in fees wiped out the advantage of having an optimal glide path vs holding the same mix all along</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you have other weapons  use them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>targetdate funds are an improvement over the pickyourpoison mess that the 401k used to be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still its an awkward world the choices arent quite yours but all the risks are</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one thing you can do is make sure that your success doesnt rest only on asset allocation</s>
<s>as stuart ritter a senior financial planner at t rowe price points out the amount you save is one of the biggest determinants of retirement success</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>critics of aggressive targetdate funds say investors should focus on saving more not on lateinthegame stock bets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to say you didnt save enough and therefore you have to take more risk it doesnt follow says joe nagengast of target date analytics a firm that sells its own glide paths for custom 401k plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but at t rowe price at least the thinking is that most people will live with some market risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ive yet to hear someone say i got out of the stock market and doubled the amount im saving so my wife and i never go on any vacations  says ritter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hes right</s>
<s>the choices are hard</s>
<s>theyre also much more than any glide path what a real financial plan is about </s>
