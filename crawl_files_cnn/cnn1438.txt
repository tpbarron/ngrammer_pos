<s>a highend landscape contractor will charge at least $5000 to remodel a typical compact suburban front yard</s>
<s>yet if you can handle a shovel hose and wheelbarrow you have the physical skills to replace overgrown or mundane greenery with fresh plants boosting curb appeal and possibly property value</s>

<p>
<s>the tricky part is getting the design right its not as simple as putting a few plants in the ground</s>
<s>heres how to achieve that upscale look on your own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>broaden the beds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a singlefile row of plants along the foundation and the property lines looks generic at best</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>widen the beds to four to six feet so theres room for more flora  and to make the plants really pop use mulch thats the color of soil says newport ri landscape architect kate field</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that means the fine dark compostlike material that costs about 25 more than basic wood chips or about $120 to $150 delivered and that lasts only one year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>focus on foliage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>replace oversize or drab plants with new shrubs and perennials arranged two or three deep with smaller plants placed in front of larger ones check the mature size listed on the label</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont get hung up on picking the best flowers says portland ore garden designer darcy daniels</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>look for plants with red purple or multicolored leaves as well as a variety of textures from fine lightgreen needles to broad darkgreen fronds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>alternate shapes too with say a conical spruce near a chunky hydrangea</s>
<s>youll pay $20 to $100 per plant depending on type and size</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>accent the architecture</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>create a focal point using a dwarf tree or a large shrub</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>when it comes to caring for your plants ditch the electric clippers which carve bushes into perfect geometric shapes</s>
