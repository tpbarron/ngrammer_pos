<s>in april a negative report on the creditworthiness of us debt sent the stock market into a oneday tizzy  even though treasury bonds hardly budged</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before that was the japanese tsunami</s>
<s>the massive scale of the destruction warranted a huge response  from relief agencies and emergency workers and radiation specialists</s>

<s>one reason investors tend to panic in a crisis is that they didnt think they could lose that much money in a short time</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>in this vein shlomo benartzi chief behavioral economist for allianz global investors recommends signing a kind of crisis contract</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a promise that you would make with your financial adviser  or your spouse or even a close friend  about how you plan to act in the event of the next major shock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its good to have a referee says benartzi</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your contract could include triggers for say what happens in the event that the market drops a certain amount in a day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such documents cant be legally binding of course</s>
<s>its your money and ultimately theres nothing anyone except maybe your spouse can do to stop you from panicselling</s>

<p>
<s>in the face of really bad news its natural to feel compelled to do something</s>
<s>michael pompian an investment consultant and author of behavioral finance and wealth management says theres a trick that can help you satisfy the urge to sell</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>think of your portfolio as a collection of three buckets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in your first  and biggest  bucket are core holdings such as bluechip stocks bonds and cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the next bucket contains assets like smallcap stocks that are part of your longterm assetallocation plan but that might expose you to more risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally theres the small chunk of money you have in things that arent necessary to achieve diversification but that you might be taking a flier on</s>
<s>this highrisk bucket could include shares of individual stocks or a volatile etf</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you segment your portfolio that way you might be able to satisfy your need to sell by simply dumping a stock in your highriskhighreturn bucket</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a fund that offers an allinone combination of stocks and bonds can help keep you on an even keel</s>
<s>these include oldfashioned balanced funds which typically have a steady mix of 60 stocks and 40 bonds asset allocation funds which tailor their mix to suit more conservative or more aggressive investors and targetdate funds that steadily move more money to bonds as you approach retirement</s>
<s>money 70 best funds to own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such funds offer two advantages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first they are likely to have to rebalance to keep to their strategy when the market falls so theyll buy when everyone else is selling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second choosing one helps you forget any notion that you must decide how much to keep in stocks on a given day</s>
<s>thats the funds job</s>
