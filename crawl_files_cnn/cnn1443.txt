</p>

<p>
<s>of course tilson hasnt always been right</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his calls on netflix have been particularly illtimed</s>
<s>he took to seeking alpha in february 2011 to tell traders to short netflix as its shares were soaring</s>
<s>that prompted netflix ceo reed hastings to defend his company on the same blog and netflixs stock continued to move higher for several more months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in late 2011 tilson changed his tune and called netflix a buy noting that its stock had already been battered too much</s>
<s>apparently sellers werent through with netflix and shares are down more than 20 this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the company reported earnings in july it warned the remainder of 2012 would be weak</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tilsons other key pick berkshire hathaway was one he touted at last years conference</s>
<s>buffetts empire has had a good year with berkshires class a stock surging 19 since tilson made his call last year</s>
</p>

<p>
