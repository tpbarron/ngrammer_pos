<s>barclays ceo bob diamond has announced his resignation in response to the banks interestratefixing scandal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  banking giant barclays capital has been rocked this past week by revelations that it manipulated libor a key benchmark for interest rates worldwide for its own benefit</s>
<s>ceo bob diamond has resigned and the scandal appears set to spread to other banks as well</s>
<s>but just what is libor and whats this whole controversy about</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what is libor</s>
<s>libor is short for the london interbank offered rate a measure of the cost of borrowing between banks and a crucial benchmark for interest rates worldwide</s>
<s>its actually a collection of rates generated for 10 currencies across 15 different time periods ranging from one day to one year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>libor rates are set each business day through a process overseen by the british bankers association</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>between seven and 18 large banks are asked what interest rate they would have to pay to borrow money for a certain period of time and in a certain currency</s>
<s>the responses are collected by thomson reuters which removes a certain percentage of the highest and lowest figures before calculating the averages and creating the libor quotes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>interbank rates are measured elsewhere in the world through similar processes</s>
<s>for example theres also japans tokyo interbank offered rate or tibor and the belgiumbased euro interbank offered rate or euribor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how does it affect consumers</s>
<s>libor is the worlds most important benchmark for interest rates</s>
<s>roughly $10 trillion in loans  including credit card rates car loans student loans and adjustablerate mortgages  as well as some $350 trillion in derivatives are tied to libor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if libor goes up your monthly interest rate payments may go up with it</s>
<s>if it goes down some borrowers will enjoy lower interest rates but mutual funds and pensions with investments in liborbased securities will earn less in interest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats the controversy all about</s>
<s>last week ukbased investment bank barclays capital bcs paid $453 million in a settlement with us and uk regulators admitting that it lied in its libor submissions about its cost of borrowing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>between 2005 and 2008 barclays traders repeatedly requested that colleagues in charge of the libor process tailor the banks submissions to benefit their trading positions</s>
<s>barclays staffers also colluded with counterparts from other banks to manipulate rates according to the settlement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the logic is similar to that of an insider trade in the stock market  if you have advance knowledge of information that will affect a security you can make trades to profit from it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition between late 2007 and early 2009 barclays made artificially low libor submissions</s>
<s>this was during the height of the financial crisis and the bank was afraid that if its submissions were too high it would get punished in the markets as investors questioned its health</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not just barclays however  suspicion has now fallen on all the banks that participate in the libor process</s>
<s>deutsche bank db royal bank of scotland rbs credit suisse cs citigroup c fortune 500 and jpmorgan chase jpm fortune 500 are among the institutions that have acknowledged they are being investigated by regulators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ubs ubs has revealed that its providing information to us and swiss officials on possible libor manipulation in exchange for leniency and conditional immunity depending on the jurisdiction</s>
<s>while barclays is the first institution ensnared by us regulators it certainly wont be the last</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how big is the scandal</s>
<s>this dwarfs by orders of magnitude any financial scams in the history of markets said andrew lo a professor of finance at the massachusetts institute of technology</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given libors vast reach and the number of global firms that may be involved in its manipulation the scandal is prompting calls for resignations criminal prosecutions and stricter regulation of the financial sector</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barclays ceo bob diamond and chief operating officer jerry del missier announced their resignations on tuesday following chairman marcus agiuss announcement a day prior</s>
<s>the bank has been hammered by politicians in the uk including prime minister david cameron who called its actions a scandal and extremely serious</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>civil suits have been filed in recent months by a wide variety of plaintiffs  ranging from mutual funds to individual traders to the city of baltimore  claiming they lost profits on liborbased securities due to banks artificial suppression of the rate</s>
<s>defendants in the consolidated case include bank of america bac fortune 500 citi hsbc jpmorgan and credit suisse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by surreptitiously bilking investors of their rightful rates of return</s>
<s>defendants reaped hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in illgotten gains one complaint says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats being done about it</s>
<s>diamond is set to testify on wednesday before british lawmakers investigating the scandal</s>
<s>meanwhile similar probes around the world are in progress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the us the justice department is conducting a criminal investigation and officials in switzerland and canada are also looking into the issue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in japan regulators temporarily suspended some transactions by ubs and citi last year after finding that traders at both banks had attempted to influence libor rates and the related tokyo interbank offered rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regulators themselves though are also facing scrutiny</s>
<s>in a lengthy public statement released tuesday barclays claimed it had alerted us and uk authorities about suspicious libor submissions by other banks in late 2008 and was disappointed that no effective action was taken</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the british bankers association meanwhile says its reviewing the process by which libor is set</s>
