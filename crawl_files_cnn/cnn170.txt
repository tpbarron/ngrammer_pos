</p>

<p>
<s>all that plus their jobs</s>
<s>the couple commute an hour each way to work jo ann has a $52000ayear position as a high school english teacher mike a retired army reservist and financial analyst at hud the us housing agency now works parttime as a security guard</s>
<s>that leaves little time to enjoy their lakefront home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were taking care of everyones needs but our own says jo ann</s>
<s>were exhausted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the couple would like to stop working in six years when jo ann marks 20 years in floridas public school system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though they have only $93000 in roth iras the nahirnys have two factors working in their favor a habit of careful budgeting and a generous amount of guaranteed income</s>
<s>mike gets $34000 a year from his hud pension and in two years will add $6000 a year from a us army reserves pension</s>
<s>another $9600 comes from a fixed annuity they bought after their savings dropped 22 in the financial crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>six years from now that $50000 or so of guaranteed income would be less than half their current intake</s>
<s>jo ann will have a pension though she cant tap it  or social security  until age 62</s>

<s>the advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pay off the home loans</s>
<s>the nahirnys are paying nearly 7 interest on their $35000 homeequity credit line and the $30000 mortgage on a house their daughter lives in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rather than fully funding their roth iras jacksonville financial planner carolyn mcclanahan advises them to use the next three years of contributions to pay off whats left of the loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that strategy makes sense she says because their loans are too small to refinance and dont offer tax benefits its not worth it for them to itemize</s>
<s>paying them off will provide a guaranteed return and eliminate $900 a month in debt payments just as they hit retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plus after their children graduate the couple plan to rent both homes bringing in an estimated $1000 a month after expenses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lower investment costs</s>
<s>the nahirnys roth iras are in actively managed funds with an average 11 expense ratio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>switching to exchangetraded funds will give them almost an extra percentage point of return a year mcclanahan says</s>
<s>she recommends putting 75 of their money in the vanguard total world stock etf vt and splitting the rest between an intermediateterm corporate bond etf and vanguard total bond market bnd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a lot of stocks for near retirees but their guaranteed income allows them to take more risk and if stocks have a good run theyll get to enjoy the extra funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plan for longterm care</s>
<s>mikes family has a history of longevity  and alzheimers</s>
<s>an ongoing stay in a facility would demolish their iras quickly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tampa insurance consultant mark maurer says a longterm care insurance policy covering $200 a day in care just under the current cost of a florida nursing home for three years adjusted for 3 a year inflation will run them $2538 annually</s>
</p>
