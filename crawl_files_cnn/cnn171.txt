<s>robert and stefanie fucci 56 and 46 of cortlandt manor ny are seeking financial advice on paying for college and saving for retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  raising three daughters born within a fiveyear span the fuccis knew theyd face steep tuition bills one day</s>
<s>but saving was tough</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the family lives in highcost westchester county where their property taxes have tripled over the past decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for many years stefanie worked parttime as a personal trainer</s>
<s>now kimberlee 17 plans to go to james madison university in virginia this fall where costs top $30000 a year high school sophomore celine 16 has pinned her hopes on going out of state too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fuccis have already cosigned $14000 worth of private loans to pay for 21yearold brittany to attend new yorks fashion institute of technology she also has $14000 in federal stafford loans</s>
<s>still they are determined to let their kids go to their dream schools</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>out of state goes against our plans but its the right fit for kimberlee says stefanie</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>helping out is stefanies second parttime job as a pharmacy technician and roberts new position as a vice president at a regional bank</s>
<s>that will boost their household income from about $100000 to $130000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>brittany also works parttime and moved back home last year reducing her nontuition expenses to $7000 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fuccis have only $35000 set aside for the girls college divided into three custodial savings utma accounts</s>
<s>robert wants to use $10000 of a $75000 lumpsum pension from an old job to help finance kimberlees freshman year</s>
<s>hell put the rest into an ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fuccis are also behind on retirement savings says new york city financial planner annette clearwaters</s>
<s>as a parttimer stefanie doesnt qualify for her employers 401k</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when robert becomes eligible to fund a 401k later this year he plans to start with a 3 contribution a rate that will leave the couple well short of the amount theyll need to hit their goal of retiring at 70 and 65 respectively says clearwaters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre also trying to pay off a $40000 homeequity loan and $10000 in credit card debt that they racked up paying for a vacation and getting a new boiler</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fuccis finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>income $130000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>assets $212000 in retirement plans $35000 in college savings $10000 in cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>goals fund college retire at 70 and 65</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>make retirement a priority</s>
<s>robert should contribute at least 6 of his income when he opens his 401k</s>
<s>that extra 3 will reduce his income just $2700 a year but give him the full company match</s>
<s>stefanie should put the $5000 max into a roth ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>get savvy about financial aid</s>
<s>the fuccis should spend the money in the utmas instead of pension funds since money in a childs name is counted heavily in financial aid formulas says kal chany president of campus consultants which advises families on financial aid</s>
<s>the couple are also eligible for a $2500 education tax credit for each child</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>public universities reserve most of their aid for instate students says chany so the fuccis are looking at taking out big loans for kimberlees tuition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>kimberlee can cut her expenses however by being a resident adviser at her dorm next year shell also get a parttime job</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>going forward the couple should take out plus parent loans which have a fixed rate of 79 and more flexible repayment terms instead of variablerate private loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fuccis should be able to pay off their credit card debt by spring which will enable them to cover more school expenses out of pocket and help kimberlee repay the loans after she graduates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally if celine wants to go out of state she should apply to private colleges where her grades shes an a student and standardized test scores exceed the average for attendees</s>
<s>privates are more generous with grants says chany</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lower investment risk</s>
<s>the fuccis say theyre comfortable with risky investments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>robert has $137000 in two 401ks from former bank employers half are in each companys stock</s>
<s>all the girls utmas are in janus 20 javlx an aggressivegrowth fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but being aggressive doesnt mean putting all your eggs in one basket says clearwaters who recommends a 70 stock30 bond allocation for the retirement money with no more than 5 in company stock and suggests that they move the girls utma funds to a lowrisk bond or moneymarket fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a small contribution adds up</s>
<s>if robert doubles what he puts in his 401k the fuccis can reduce their risk and still come out ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>robert currently contributes 3 of his income to his 401k</s>
<s>if he continues at that rate the fuccis $212000 in retirement savings is estimated to grow to $614000 over the course of 12 years</s>
<s>but if robert doubles his contribution to 6 that same portfolio is expected to swell to $715030</s>
