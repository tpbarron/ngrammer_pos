<s>earlier best buy bby fortune 500and toys r us also said they would match online prices of amazon walmart and sears</s>
<s>this year toys r us is even launching its own ipad competitor for kids tabeo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why the mad rush to offer incentives for holiday shoppers even before halloween this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>store owners dont want to be caught flat footed like last year when americans turned up in throngs on black friday the day after thanksgiving</s>
<s>but then shoppers stayed away for days only to return for big doorbuster deals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>retailers are also wary that the slow economic recovery and high gas prices will make americans less willing to open their wallets freely this holiday season</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the national retail federation said that people are also worried about the upcoming fiscal cliff the struggling jobs market and weak income growth</s>
<s>another distraction that could keep people from shopping early is the upcoming presidential election</s>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>people dont want to miss the opportunity to get the hot items said jai holtz vice president of financial services at sears holdings shld fortune 500 which owns kmart</s>
