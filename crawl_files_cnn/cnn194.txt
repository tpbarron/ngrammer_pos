<s>he suggests corrado take out a second 20year $700000 policy now which should run about $145 a month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hoard cash</s>

<s>they need to have at least six months of expenses in cash so that they can keep up their lifestyle and savings habits in slow business cycles which are to be expected</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>boost income</s>
<s>a parttime job for amy possibly at the deli if someone quits could do wonders for the couples security martin notes</s>
<s>its also more feasible for her now that both kids are in school</s>
<s>assuming she takes in $15000 after taxes the fabbros would be able to cover their extra insurance needs build a cash cushion and once thats done save $7500 a year for college</s>
