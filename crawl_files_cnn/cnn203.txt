<s>new york money magazine  how can i find out if my 401k funds are invested in companies that ship american jobs offshore</s>

<p>
<s>the issue of american companies outsourcing jobs to foreign countries has gotten lots of attention throughout the presidential race</s>
<s>thats not surprising</s>
<s>any move thats perceived as hurting already struggling american workers is going to arouse controversy and passions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but at the risk of offending you and others who may see this practice as unpatriotic or worse my advice is that you put this issue aside when deciding how to invest your 401k or any other savings for that matter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i say this for several reasons</s>
<s>one is that i dont know of any rigorous way to identify firms that ship or may ship jobs offshore</s>
<s>its not something you can screen for like rising revenues low priceearnings ratios or a high return on equity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while its easy to say you dont want to invest in firms that export american jobs its quite another to determine which companies you would consider guilty of that offense</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example if a large company shifts an operation abroad resulting in the loss of 100 us jobs then later that year hires an added 100 people at a different us division would you still consider it a job exporter even though the overall count of american jobs stayed the same</s>
<s>what if the company added 200 jobs here giving it a net gain</s>

<p>
<s>or how about this scenario two identical companies make video game controllers except one has always imported joysticks from abroad while the other has always made them in its own facility here</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>suppose the company that makes its own joysticks closes its plant here and builds one in a foreign country to lower costs and stay competitive</s>
<s>presumably it would be guilty of shipping jobs overseas while the company that has always imported joysticks wouldnt be as it never had a joystick plant in the us to close</s>
<s>but are the two companies really doing anything different</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course i suppose you could say you wouldnt want to invest in the company that imports joysticks either as it could use an american manufacturer of the components instead</s>
<s>but if you start eliminating companies because they import parts from abroad youre going to have a small universe of companies to choose from when putting together a portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if you could come up with some broad principles to sort out such complexities you would still run into practical difficulties on the investing front</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for one thing most 401ks offer a menu of mutual funds or similar investment pools that contain hundreds or even thousands of businesses</s>
<s>assuming you go to the trouble of sifting through all the companies in a fund in hopes of identifying job exporters you still wouldnt be able to exclude offenders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when you invest in a fund you get all the companies in that fund</s>
<s>you cant pick and choose companies within a fund</s>
<s>you could decide not to invest in that fund</s>
<s>but i suspect that almost any fund in a 401k roster is going to include at least some companies that have relocated operations abroad or that might in the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related why theres no such thing as riskfree investing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally even if you were somehow able to create a portfolio made up solely of companies that havent shipped jobs overseas and wont in the future im not sure it would be a portfolio you would want to own purely from an investing point of view</s>
<s>at the very least i expect it would be difficult to build a truly diversified portfolio operating under that jobs constraint</s>
<s>in any case building such a portfolio would require a huge amount of time and effort not to mention expertise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line if you want to make outsourcing a factor in choosing political candidates or you want to advocate for specific policies in this area go for it</s>
<s>but when it comes to investing your 401k i recommend you ignore this issue and focus on building the best retirement portfolio you can</s>
