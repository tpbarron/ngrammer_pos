<p>
<s>sounds like youre already taking the most important steps to get on the path to a secure retirement</s>
<s>youre saving on a regular basis maximizing taxadvantaged options  youre even going above and beyond by investing a substantial sum in a taxable account each year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>assuming all that saving amounts to a reasonable percentage of your annual income  say 15 or so  i dont think you need to make any radical changes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said you may be able to enhance your retirement prospects by improving your retirementplanning strategy a bit</s>
<s>the key though is concentrating your efforts in areas that are likely to have the highest payoff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres what i recommend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>when it comes to investing keep it simple</s>
<s>unless you believe you have unique insights into the financial prospects for specific companies id pass on investing in individual stocks</s>
<s>without an edge youre not likely to outperform the market averages and you could end up dragging down your returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>similarly ignore the endless variety of niche funds and etfs that investment firms constantly churn out</s>
<s>here im talking about funds and etfs that home in on particular sectors of the market  oil gas platinum gold currencies individual foreign countries etc</s>
<s> or that employ risky or arcane investing techniques a la inverse funds and leveraged etfs</s>
<s>its tough to integrate such investments into your portfolio in a coherent way and theyre ultimately not worth the extra expense and effort</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related ground rules for retirement investing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead focus on building a straightforward portfolio of broadly diversified stock and bond funds that will give you exposure to all areas of the market</s>
<s>for guidance on how to divvy up your money  between stocks and bonds overall and among particular types of stocks and bonds  just plug the ticker symbol for the vanguard targetdate retirement fund designed for someone your age  in your case the 2040 vforx or 2045 fund vtivx  into morningstars portfolio xray tool</s>
<s>you dont have to mimic its allocations precisely but you probably dont want to stray too far from them either</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>aim for lower costs</s>
<s>your best shot at boosting your returns without taking on additional risk is to invest as much as possible in lowexpense funds</s>
<s>generally that means looking for stock funds that have expense ratios below 1 and bond funds with expense ratios less than 075</s>
<s>you can do even better though by sticking to lowcost index funds and etfs like those on the money 70 list of recommended funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course in your 401k youre limited to the menu of investments offered by your plan</s>
<s>but by perusing the fee disclosure the department of labor now requires plan sponsors to provide you should be able to sift through your 401ks investment roster and choose reasonably priced options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>beware investment pitches based on tax benefits</s>
<s>after investing all you can in taxadvantaged 401ks and iras you can plow any extra savings into taxable accounts as youre already doing to the tune of $4500 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just be careful</s>
<s>many advisers are quick to recommend variable annuities or life insurance investments for taxable accounts because of their potential tax savings</s>
<s>problem is these options typically come with high fees not to mention a mindnumbing level of complexity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related the case for investing in bonds too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a better solution is to stash any saving you do outside 401ks and iras in taxefficient investments like index funds etfs and taxmanaged funds</s>
<s>youll likely pay far lower expenses which will give you a better shot at a higher aftertax rate of return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>4</s>
<s>save more as your income rises</s>
<s>theres a natural tendency for people to ratchet up their lifestyle at a faster rate than their paycheck as it grows</s>
<s>but that can lead to problems come retirement time</s>
<s>the reason as your income climbs the percentage of your preretirement salary that social security will replace starts to shrink</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so the more you earn during your career the more youll have to depend on your personal savings to maintain your standard of living in retirement</s>
<s>to avoid having to scale back your lifestyle during retirement try to increase the percentage of your income you save as your earnings increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>5</s>
<s>monitor your progress</s>
<s>over the course of a career any number of setbacks  layoffs market downturns etc</s>
<s> can derail even the best laid retirement plans</s>
<s>thats why its crucial to evaluate how things are going and make adjustments if necessary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can do that several ways</s>
<s>one is to periodically assess the balance of your retirement accounts relative to your annual income</s>
<s>another is to rev up an online calculator like our retirement planner</s>
<s>the important thing though is that one way or another you come away with a realistic sense of whether your current saving and investing plan is working and if not make the necessary tweaks to put you back on track</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you already appear to be off to an excellent start in your retirement planning</s>
<s>and if you follow these five tips your chances of making a smooth transition from the workaday world to your postcareer life should be just as upbeat</s>
