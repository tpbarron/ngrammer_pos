<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>so he began experimenting with alloys and even invented a tool a spatulafork combo to sell with the product</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when barrett showed the results to his ceo in 2007 the boss a longtime friend told him that the company wasnt interested in consumer products but he offered barrett warehouse space and help finding manufacturers</s>
