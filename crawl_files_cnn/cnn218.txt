<s>investors are driven by two emotions fear and greed</s>
<s>too much fear can sink stocks well below where they should be</s>
<s>when investors get greedy they can bid up stock prices way too far</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so what emotion is driving the market now</s>
<s>cnnmoneys fear  greed index makes it clear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we look at 7 indicators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>•stock price momentum the sp 500 spx versus its 125day moving average</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>•stock price strength the number of stocks hitting 52week highs and lows on the new york stock exchange</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>•stock price breadth the volume of shares trading in stocks on the rise versus those declining</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>•put and call options the putcall ratio which compares the trading volume of bullish call options relative to the trading volume of bearish put options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>•junk bond demand the spread between yields on investment grade bonds and junk bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>•market volatility the vix vix which measures volatility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>•safe haven demand the difference in returns for stocks versus treasuries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for each indicator we look at how far theyve veered from their average relative to how far they normally veer</s>
<s>we look at each on a scale from 0  100</s>
<s>the higher the reading the greedier investors are being and 50 is neutral</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then we put all the indicators together  equally weighted  for a final index reading</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the sp 500 spx plummeted to a threeyear low on sept 17 2008  the height of the financial crisis  the fear and greed index sank to 12</s>
<s>the index gained some ground to 28 before stocks finally bottomed out on march 9 2009 and the latest bull market began</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most recently in the first quarter of 2012 stocks staged their best run in decades and the index showed pure greed</s>
