<s>new york cnnmoney  a year after graduating from college women are earning thousands of dollars less per year than their male peers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>women who worked fulltime jobs one year after receiving their diplomas earned 82 cents for every dollar men earned</s>
<s>thats according to a report from the american association of university women which analyzed data from a department of education survey of 15000 graduates conducted in 2009 the most recent data available</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while men earned average salaries of $42918 women earned $35296  a nearly $8000 difference the report found</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>you hear in the news that millennial women are now outearning their male peers but what we found in looking at those emerging from college is that there is still a gender pay gap said catherine hill director of research at aauw</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why the gap</s>
<s>men typically choose majors that result in more lucrative careers postgraduation like engineering</s>
<s>even if men and women major in the same subject men tend to end up in higherpaying jobs</s>
<s>men also work more hours according to aauw</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even when controlling for these factors  by looking at men and women with the same majors jobs and hours  women were still paid 7 less than men</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related women are back on the job</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>female business majors for example earned a little over $38000 while men earned more than $45000</s>
<s>among men and women who took teaching jobs women earned 89 of what men earned</s>
<s>and while men reported working 45 hours a week compared to the 43 hours reported by women among those who said they work 40 hours a week women earned 84 of what men earned across all jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>other less measurable factors may also be at play such as gender discrimination and willingness to negotiate salary which studies have shown men are more likely to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>debt piles up for female grads thanks to this pay gap women are spending a much bigger share of their earnings on monthly student loan payments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while women and men borrowed similar amounts of money to fund their education nearly half of women were paying more than 8 of their earnings toward student loan debt in 2009</s>
<s>less than 40 of men were paying the same amount</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related the other reason grads are drowning in debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the aauw estimates that based on pay its unmanageable for women to spend more than 78 of their earnings on student loan debt</s>
<s>yet 53 of women paid more than this</s>
<s>meanwhile 39 of men paid more than the 89 threshold that aauw says is affordable for men</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its shocking that these numbers are as high as they are and it suggests to us that student debt continues to grow but were not seeing the same increases in wages  and womens wages in particular are not keeping pace said hill</s>
