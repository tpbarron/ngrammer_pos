<s>the oftcited rule is to start by pulling 4 from your savings and then increase the dollar amount of that draw by the inflation rate each year to keep up your purchasing power</s>
<s>that annual inflation adjustment is why you cant just withdraw what your investments earn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do that and you have a good chance that your nest egg will support you for decades</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>realworld complications though can wreak havoc with the 4 strategy  just ask anyone who left work on the eve of the 2000 or 2008 bear markets</s>

<s>after decades of paying attention to longterm averages while you saved you need to readjust your thinking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the table below shows when you suffer a sizable setback or a string of lousy returns especially early in retirement the combination of rising withdrawal amounts and subpar performance can so seriously deplete your portfolio that your chances of running through your savings dramatically increase</s>

<s>the fact is given all the uncertainties in retirement  how your investments will perform what your actual expenses will be how long youll live  you cant pick the ideal withdrawal rate in advance</s>
<s>youll either deplete your savings too soon or leave behind money that you could have enjoyed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a better strategy start with a reasonable withdrawal rate like 4 and finetune as you go</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can do that with an online tool like t rowe prices retirement income calculator</s>
<s>plug in the value of your savings and the amount youd like to take out each year and youll get an estimate of the probability youll be able to maintain that rate of spending</s>

<s>if a market downturn has depressed the value of your nest egg so much that the probability of your dough lasting has significantly declined forgo an inflation adjustment or trim your withdrawals until the outlook improves</s>
<s>when the markets have done well on the other hand you may be able to boost your withdrawals and indulge yourself</s>
<s>the key is to stay flexible</s>
