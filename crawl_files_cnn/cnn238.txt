<s>know your true costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since colleges dont reveal financial aid packages until after a student is accepted families often shop blindly not knowing which schools they can really afford</s>
<s>thats about to change</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>starting in october all colleges must provide online calculators that estimate how much a family will pay after deducting grants and scholarships at that particular school</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regard the results as a rough estimate not a precise indic n ation of the amount of aid your child will get or how much will be in grants vs loans</s>
<s>as mark kantrowitz head of finaidorg says the calculator is likely to tell you if a particular college is in your financial ballpark but not whether your aid package will get you to first base or home plate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how to proceed use the calculators to identify schools that might be more affordable than you thought</s>
<s>then if you need a more accurate appraisal before your child decides whether to apply talk to the institutions financial aid officer  some colleges offer an early estimate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if your child receives an aid offer that includes loans use the calculator at finaidorg to determine the size of the monthly payments</s>
<s>to be affordable those total payments be sure to multiply by four should not exceed 10 of your childs expected monthly income after graduation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>someone repaying $25000 in loans at 68 over 10 years for example would need to earn at least $34500 to afford the monthly payment of $288</s>

<p>
<s>stir up competition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>colleges are often willing to pony up more aid to entice their best applicants to choose them over other schools</s>
<s>elite colleges such as harvard and cornell are forthright about it promising to match better financial aid offers from other topranked schools</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even colleges that dont publicize matching offers often make them according to david lang an economist at sacramento state university</s>
<s>in an informal survey of 10 public colleges financial aid officers at half told him privately they had matched competing offers</s>
<s>and lang found that students who were accepted into two similarly ranked colleges got about 15 more aid than those who got into just one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how to proceed your child should apply strategically to schools to set the stage for aid negotiations later</s>
<s>the list should include several colleges where his grades and sat score rank in the top 25 of students advises lynn oshaughnessy author of the college solution</s>

<p>
<s>children from families unlikely to qualify for needbased aid should also include one or two colleges that award lots of merit aid to find them go to collegedatacom</s>
<s>more than one reach school can be in the mix as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once the student has a few offers you can try to set off a little aid bidding war smartly and politely oshaughnessy says</s>
<s>start with a call or letter to your childs first choice college</s>
