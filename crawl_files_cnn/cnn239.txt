<s>even if your family earns too much money to qualify for federal needbased aid there is plenty of other aid you might qualify for thats based on need</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while families earning more than $45000 a year typically dont qualify for needbased federal aid some elite schools  like yale  give their own needbased grants to families earning $225000 or even more a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres how to determine what you qualify for</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the government and colleges assess need by looking at the total cost of attendance minus what they estimate your family can afford</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that estimate which is referred to as your expected family contribution efc is determined based on the information you provide when you fill out the free application for federal student aid fafsa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the information theyll ask for is your familys earnings as well as the amount you have in savings or investment accounts</s>
<s>the only students who dont have to provide the financial information about their parents are those who are over 23 married parents themselves or soldiers or veterans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are calculators and worksheets that can help you determine your efc</s>
<s>for more information read what is the efc</s>
<s>or visit the web sites of the us department of education and the college board</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the 201213 academic year the us department of education expects to award pell grants to students with an efc below $4995</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>college aid officials adjust your federal efc and determine how much financial aid to award you depending upon their own review of your finances</s>
<s>many colleges will calculate their own efc for use in awarding their own financial aid</s>
<s>you may even be asked to fill out the college boards cssfinancial aid profile which asks for even more financial information than the fafsa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just keep in mind that no matter what efc the college or government calculates no college or university is required to offer you enough grants to meet your need</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact only a few dozen colleges in the us  mostly expensive elite colleges such as harvard amherst and vanderbilt  promise to provide enough grants to meet their estimate of your need</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the rest including most public universities leave a gap that students must fund through loans work merit scholarships or family contributions</s>
<s>the average gap between the average students efc and the total amount of grants the student receives was about $5800 in 2008 the most recent year for which data is available according to the us department of education</s>
