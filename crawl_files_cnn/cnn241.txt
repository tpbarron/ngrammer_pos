</p>

<p>
<s>since the launch of windows phone 7 two years ago the software giant has thrown hundreds of millions of dollars into developing and marketing its mobile operating system  with little success</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in some respects its heading in the wrong direction</s>
<s>microsofts smartphone sales are slowly ticking up but the rest of the market is growing much faster</s>
<s>microsofts smartphone market share fell to just 36 in september  roughly a third of the share microsoft msft fortune 500 commanded a month before windows phone launched</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the irony is that the product is actually pretty great</s>
<s>most reviewers praised its innovative interface and the relatively small number of people who actually use windows phone love it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>windows phone 8 is even better offering a host of improvements over the previous iteration</s>
<s>the new software got some muchneeded tweaks and snazzy new features that rival those on the iphone or most popular android devices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still few phone shoppers are willing to stray from the iphoneandandroid duopoly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft says its willing to be very very patient</s>
<s>in its redmond wash headquarters the windows phone story sounds awfully similar to that of xbox  a perennial money loser that spent the better part of a decade mired in third place behind nintendo and sony</s>
<s>xbox debuted in 2001 but didnt turn a profit until 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after establishing several successful video game franchises and launching its xbox live service xbox was able to overtake its rivals late last year</s>
<s>its currently a close second in global sales behind sonys playstation 3 according to industry tracker vgchartz</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>the analysts think its possible</s>
<s>idc forecasts that windows phone will overtake apples aapl fortune 500 iphone by 2016 gaining 192 of the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how can microsofts tortoise catch up to the industrys hares</s>
<s>with strong hardware partnerships relentless marketing and tight ties to microsofts more successful brands including skype and microsoft office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but as always with microsoft execution is the big question mark</s>
</p>

<s>critics like nokias phones which won a best in show award at this years consumer electronics show but customers have stayed away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nokias next shot the lumia 920 smartphone has gotten very positive reviews  just like the first lumia did</s>
</p>

<s>with hundreds of millions of users expected to migrate to windows 8 over the next several years the new microsoft ecosystem could make the very similar windows phone 8 a more attractive item</s>

<p>
<s>just as apples myriad devices all seamlessly share content and googles goog fortune 500 services tend to work best on android devices microsoft too is building an ecosystem of gadgets that play nicely with one another windows 8 windows phone 8 and xbox all they function in much the same way and run the same apps content and services</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its evolving literally into being a single platform bill gates said of windows phone and windows in a recent video blog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that could be the biggest selling point of all</s>
</p>
