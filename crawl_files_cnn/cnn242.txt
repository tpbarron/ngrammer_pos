<p>
<s>for a start taxes are a hazy issue</s>
<s>the principles of the two sides are clear enough president barack obama wants to raise taxes for the wealthy</s>
<s>mitt romney is proposing to slash rates</s>
<s>yet romneys sweeping but unspecified tax reforms make calculating your personal bottom line hard</s>
<s>and with the federal debt now above $11 trillion neither candidates tax policies may be sustainable over time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>health care is another wildcard</s>
<s>romney is promising to repeal the affordable care act the law that by 2022 is projected to cover 30 million people who would otherwise be uninsured</s>
<s>the impact of that on you depends largely on whether you feel secure in the coverage you already have</s>
<s>but romney especially with his pick of paul ryan as a running mate has kindled another debate over health care that directly affects almost every american</s>
<s>the 2012 election has become a fight over the future of medicare</s>

<s>obama wants to keep most of the bushera tax cuts notes allen sinai of the forecasting firm decision economics</s>
<s>but while romney says hell deliver even more cuts the president wants to raise rates on income above $250000 or so</s>

<p>

<p>
<s>these cuts would spill a barrel of red ink all over an already crimson federal budget even with the spending cuts romney proposes</s>
<s>so he would make up for lost revenue with a major reform that limited tax breaks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the catch the nominee has said very little about which breaks would be on the chopping block</s>
<s>many such provisions are highly popular including three of the biggest the mortgageinterest and charitable deductions and the taxfree treatment of employerprovided health insurance</s>

<p>
<s>the potential impact based only on the rate cuts and other items romney has been specific about the nonpartisan tax policy center has concluded that for a household earning between $75000 and $100000 the average savings would be $2000 or a 27 increase in your aftertax income</s>
<s>thats relative to todays tax policy the cuts are larger if you assume the expiration of the bushera tax rates</s>

<p>
<s>those earning between $100000 and $200000 would get a cut of $4000 bumping up takehome pay by an average of 36</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>those numbers dont include other tax reforms though and thats where things get sticky</s>

<s>obama</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the promise the presidents tax plan is easier to quantify if only because the white house has had to spell it out in budget proposals</s>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<s>obama also wants to raise investment taxes on high earners to a top rate of 20 on longterm capital gains their dividends could be taxed as ordinary income</s>

<p>
<s>similar to romney obama wants to broaden the amount of income thats taxed</s>
<s>his main way of doing this essentially boils down to limiting the value of your itemized deductions if youre a very high earner</s>

<s> obama is straightup proposing to raise your taxes</s>
<s>for everybody else the important question is whether the promise to keep taxes low is sustainable</s>
</p>

<p>
