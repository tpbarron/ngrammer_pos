<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  how much should the rich pay in taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a heated question these days</s>
<s>president obama and his republican challenger mitt romney spar over it bitterly</s>
<s>and the taxes romney pays on his own vast wealth have become the subject of massive press attention</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the question is not so easily answered and depends on a number of hardtonaildown factors  starting with how you define rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>virtually no one thinks of themselves as wealthy said joseph henchman a policy analyst at the tax foundation</s>
<s>theyre thinking about what others should pay in taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most people would say millionaires and billionaires are rich</s>
<s>thats easy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>where to draw the line lower down the income scale is much harder</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a recent pew survey asked people what it takes to be wealthy in their community</s>
<s>of those surveyed 39 answered between $100000 and $250000 for a family of 4</s>
<s>another 30 said it takes $250000 or more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one frequently used definition of rich is the top 1 of federal tax filers  those with adjusted gross incomes of at least $343927 in 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they earned nearly 17 of all agi in the country and paid more than a third 37 of all federal income taxes collected by the government</s>
<s>is that too much</s>
<s>too little</s>
<s>take the poll</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or to look at it another way the groups average effective tax rate  agi divided by income taxes paid  was 24 more than twice the national average</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a much wealthier subset of that group  the top 01  had an agi of at least $143 million</s>
<s>they paid 17 of income taxes collected</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but using agi as a proxy for rich and measuring only whats paid in federal income taxes has its limits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for one thing agi doesnt give the fullest picture of income</s>
<s>some wealthy individuals pay little or nothing in federal income taxes because their income is from sources not included in agi such as taxfree municipal bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>poll how much should the rich pay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>federal income taxes meanwhile dont reflect a households total federal tax burden</s>
<s>that leaves out things like payroll taxes estate taxes and corporate taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tax policy center incorporates these broader views of income and tax burdens in its calculations</s>
<s>and it found that in 2009 people making more than $1 million in total income paid roughly 16 of all federal taxes in 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ultimately there is no right answer about how much the rich should pay</s>
<s>a majority of americans simply say more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all tax systems are based on a variety of arbitrary opinions and intuitions</s>
<s>we rely on the political system to  avoid abuse and approximate fairness  historian joe thorndike has noted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>president obama wants families with incomes over $250000 to pay more</s>
<s>mitt romney wants the welloff to pay the same share in taxes as they do now but its not clear how he defines rich in this regard</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and policymakers will have to decide not only on a definition of rich but also consider broader questions about the federal budget and economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>questions such as what do americans want from their government and how much will it cost</s>
<s>what is the fair level of taxes on the rich relative to everyone else</s>
<s>and should the more than 40 of households with no federal income tax liability  thanks largely to tax breaks  be asked to pay something in income taxes as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the end any decision washington makes about taxing the rich could affect the economy</s>
<s>how much it would is a question of great debate among economists</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>will raising taxes on the rich hurt the economy</s>
<s>because if it does it has implications for the rest of us said roberton williams a senior fellow of the tax policy center</s>
