<s>financial aid helps millions of students afford college each year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the money is donated by the government thanks to taxpayers colleges and charities and given to students or their parents to help them pay for a higher education</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however while some types of financial aid are wonderful other types dont really provide much aid at all</s>
<s>thats because there is no truthinlabeling law that requires colleges governments or charities to explain exactly what strings might be attached or how much aid they are really providing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here are the three major types of financial aid and what you need to know</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>generally speaking grants and scholarships offer free money to help you pay for your education</s>
<s>in a nutshell this can be the best type of financial aid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal government for example gave about 8 million lowincome undergraduates from families earning less than about $40000 pell grants averaging about $4000 apiece in 201011  thats free money for college that they didnt have to pay back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but students who receive grants for college need to read the fine print first</s>
<s>some socalled grants are really loans they might have to repay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal governments teach grant for example provides up to $4000 a year to fund coursework for students preparing to be teachers in highneed areas</s>
<s>but if recipients of this grant fail to meet the exact letter of the law after they graduate the grants turn into loans that must be repaid with interest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unlike most grants and scholarships you have to pay these loans back plus interest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the biggest source of college financial aid loans is the federal government</s>
<s>in 2011 the us department of education loaned more than $100 billion to students and parents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the lowestcost federally backed student loan is the perkins loan</s>
<s>as of early 2012 this loan charged no interest while the student was in school and only 5 a year after the student left school</s>
<s>unfortunately there is a shortage of perkins funds so only the neediest students are generally able to take them out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the nextbest deal is the federal stafford loan</s>
<s>any student who attends college at least halftime and is a citizen or has a green card is entitled to borrow at least $5500 through this program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for new loans awarded in the fall of 2012 the federal government was planning to charge 68 in annual interest plus 1 percentage point in fees for an annual percentage rate of 7</s>
<s>however in early 2012 there was some congressional debate about lowering the rate for students who qualified as needy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>note some stafford loans are called unsubsidized but that is a little misleading</s>
<s>since private lenders wont give most students money at a 7 rate all stafford loans are subsidized by taxpayers</s>
<s>the subsidized stafford loans however have lower interest costs and so are more subsidized</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although that rate may seem high those student loans are considered financial aid because they offer advantages that no private loan does such as providing loans to students who have no credit history without requiring an adult or parent to promise to repay giving borrowers the option to make payments based on their income after graduation and forgiving some of the loan for public service</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>families who need to borrow more than the maximum perkins and stafford can try for a federal parent loans known as plus</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plus loans charge 79 in annual interest plus 4 in upfront fees for a total apr of 88</s>
<s>these are considered financial aid because they are available to parents whose lessthanperfect credit scores might be rejected by banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some colleges and charities also offer college financial aid loans that charge no or very low interest rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but students and parents need to read the fine print on their college financial aid letters and bills</s>
<s>not all educational loans are financial aid</s>
<s> some are simply standard business transactions</s>
<s>to qualify as financial aid student or parent loans are supposed to offer better terms than you could get from a private company such as a bank credit union or other lender</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>any student can apply for a job opening on or offcampus to earn money for school</s>
<s>but students whom the college determines have financial need have first dibs on certain federallysubsidized campus jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these jobs pay standard hourly wages just like other jobs</s>
<s>but they have one big advantage their earnings dont count as income in future financial aid applications and dont reduce the odds of getting needbased financial aid the following year</s>
</p>

<s>next grants and scholarships how to get free moneyÂ </s>
