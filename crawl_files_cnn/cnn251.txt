<p>
<s>amazon wine operates more as a middleman offering customers a selection of around 1000 wines at prices ranging from $5 to $200</s>
<s>a $10 shipping fee covers up to six bottles of wine</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>it first took a run at the wine market in 1999 with a $30 million investment in wineshoppercom a san francisco startup that went bust in the dotcom collapse</s>
<s>ten years later it tried again through a partnership with new vine logistics a shipping service that went bankrupt after new california regulations wreaked havoc with its business model</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this time around amazon amzn fortune 500 is outsourcing most of the work</s>
<s>its site will funnel sales to the wineries it works with which will directly ship their products to amazons buyers</s>
</p>

<p>
