<s>france has the highest tax rate with a 75 rate on millionaires</s>
<s>in the us the fight is over whether to extend the top rate to little more than half that amount</s>

<s>new york cnnmoney  joseph j thorndike is a contributing editor at tax analysts and a columnist for tax notes magazine</s>
<s>his new book the fair share taxing the rich in the age of fdr will be published later this year by the urban institute press</s>

<p>
<s>frances socialist president françois hollande is the talk of europe for his planned 75 tax rate on individual incomes over €1 million</s>
<s>when enacted the new rate will catapult france to the top of the list of hightax countries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hollande has defended the new rate as part of his effort to shrink frances budget deficit</s>
<s>but the new supertax is about more than raising money</s>
<s>it is also designed to make a point</s>
<s>its symbolic hollande has said</s>
<s>it will show an example</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed thats the essential nature of very high rates on very rich people</s>
<s>they arent really about raising money although they can do that pretty well sometimes</s>
<s>rather they are designed to make a political statement about fairness and economic justice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in washington of course the fight is over whether to raise the top rate to a level just over half the amount they are arguing about in france  to 396 from 35</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contrast numerous countries have top rates in the low to mid50s including austria belgium denmark finland japan and sweden</s>
<s>the worlds highest rate is levied in sunny aruba where people making more than $171000 face a top rate of 5895 according to figures compiled by kpmg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still thats a long way from hollandes 75</s>
<s>but us history offers a refuge for hollande and other fans of supertaxes on the rich</s>
<s>the united states had a top rate of 70 as recently as 1980</s>
<s>read more by this author nixon paid 61</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>famously president reagan convinced congress to slash that rate and others dramatically</s>
<s>high rates were a drag on the economy and a barrier to prosperity he argued</s>
<s>by the end of reagans second term the economy was booming and the top rate was just 28</s>
<s>coincidence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well yes at least according to fans of raising taxes on the rich</s>
<s>they point to the 1950s when rates were as high as 90 and economic growth was solid</s>
<s>president eisenhower was a genuine budget hawk and he convinced his republican party colleagues to swallow hard and accept high rates as a fiscal necessity</s>
<s>related 6 of richest in us paid no tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so high tax rates are good for the country at least in the face of deficits right</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not exactly</s>
<s>most economists in the 1950s thought high rates were deeply pernicious</s>
<s>sure rich people would keep working in the face of high rates but not quite as hard</s>
<s>instead they would focus their efforts on finding ways to avoid high tax rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>worse high rates had a tendency to make the public more tolerant of tax avoidance and push lawmakers into enacting more loopholes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today no one is arguing for a return to eisenhowerera 90 rates</s>
<s>and reasonable people can disagree about where the bad effects of high rates really begin to show up</s>
<s>is it at 40</s>
<s>50</s>
<s>75</s>
<s>theres no easy or definitive answer although some recent research from progressively minded economists would suggest that the number could be surprisingly close to hollandes 75</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ultimately however such research is immaterial at least in political terms</s>
<s>the argument for raising tax rates on rich people has never really been about revenue incentives or even growth</s>
<s>its been about fairness plain and simple</s>
<s>fans of soaking the rich are happy to embrace studies that support their policy agenda</s>
<s>but it seems fair to say they would still like supertaxes even if they slowed growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related worlds largest economies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>certainly thats been the lesson of us history</s>
<s>even the economists who crafted fdrs new deal in the 1930s understood that big tax hikes on the rich came at a price</s>
<s>but by and large they also believed that such rates were necessary politically if not fiscally</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ultimately those high rates came down</s>
<s>but it took a long long time and the damage caused by those rates played a key role in shaping the conservative revival of the 1970s</s>
<s>by the late 1960s republicans were ready to challenge that system and the new gop rode an antitax wave into power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if youre looking for the roots of modern antitax politics you can start with the progressive tax rates of the 1930s</s>
<s>soaking the rich can seem like a good idea especially when times are tough</s>
<s>but its a perilous agenda at least for fans of progressive taxation</s>
