<s>some colleges are copying the way hotels and airlines are adding hidden fees to their advertised prices</s>
<s>to avoid unpleasant surprises when looking at different colleges and their costs you need to make sure youre comparing apples to apples</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here are the different terms colleges use to quote their prices along with some advice on which ones to ask the financial aid office about</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tuition and fees tuition is the basic cost of instruction</s>
<s>fees are mandatory extra charges added to those basic costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some schools list tuition separately from fees in much the same way hotels and airlines try to make their prices look smaller</s>
<s>but just like with hotels this practice often leads to unpleasant surprises when it comes time to pay the bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition some schools charge different tuition and fees for different courses  often more for science music or art courses for example</s>
<s>and some schools such as penn state charge higher tuition and fees for the more advanced courses generally taken in the last two years of college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for those planning to live at home during college the combined tuition and fees cost is the best way to compare different schools prices</s>
<s>make sure you add tuition and fees together for every school and compare the tuition and fees for comparable courses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>direct costs colleges with dorms and cafeterias sometimes list a direct cost which includes tuition fees room and board</s>
<s>these expenses are considered direct because they make up the bills students pay directly to the college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>remember that students will have other indirect costs such as textbooks laundry and travel</s>
<s>the college board estimates that the average student spends about $4000 a year on indirect costs see table 1</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cost of attendance cost of education or sticker price the total cost of a year of study including tuition fees room board books travel and standard incidental expenses such as laundry</s>
<s>federal law requires each college to make readily available to current and prospective students its total cost of attendance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some colleges have tried to hide this and provide simply tuition or direct costs to look more affordable</s>
<s>they obey the letter of the law by providing a true cost of attendance only if students ask for it</s>
<s>did your college hide its cost of attendance</s>
<s>let us know</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cost of attendance is sometimes called the sticker price because it is the published price before a students grants or scholarships are subtracted</s>
<s>think of it like the price on the sticker of a new car at a dealership  theres plenty of opportunities to lower the price</s>
<s>about 80 of students at private colleges and 50 of students at public colleges receive at least one grant or scholarship that allows them to pay less than the sticker price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you are sure the student will not receive any grants or scholarships from any school and doesnt plan to live at home during the school year then the total cost of attendance is the price you should expect to pay at each school</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>net price the cost of attendance after grants and scholarships are subtracted out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>only about half of all college students pay their colleges published cost of attendance sometimes called the sticker price</s>
<s> the rest receive grants or scholarships that allow them to pay a lower net price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>typically grants or scholarships are awarded to students with need such as low income or merit such as good grades or special talents in sports music arts or other fields</s>
<s>so the best and neediest students usually pay lower net prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a new federal law requires all colleges to post a net price calculator on their websites to allow applicants to figure out ahead of time what their net price is likely to be</s>
<s>if you think you will receive any financial aid the net price is the best and fairest way to compare different colleges costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>outofpocket price some colleges are posting or sending to students an outofpocket price which consists of the cost of attendance minus grants and loans as well as other financial aid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while these outofpocket prices can help families budget how much cash the student will have to come up with immediately remember that loans must be repaid with interest eventually and workstudy money must be earned</s>
</p>

<s>next find out what youll really payÂ </s>
