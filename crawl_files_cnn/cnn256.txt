<s>a new tax policy center estimate looks at one possible way to help pay for mitt romneys tax plan a cap on itemized deductions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  one of the big unknowns about mitt romneys $5 trillion tax plan is how he would pay for it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to a report released wednesday one of the options he has talked about wouldnt raise nearly enough money on its own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the report by the tax policy center assumes two promises romney has made a 20 cut in all income tax rates and a repeal of the alternative minimum tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has said he would pay for his plan in two ways by curbing tax breaks primarily on the wealthy and by spurring economic growth to generate new revenue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to rein in tax breaks he might seek to limit how much tax filers can claim in itemized deductions</s>
<s>and he even suggested that such deductions could be phased out entirely for highincome households</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but heres why that alone would fall short repeal of all itemized deductions would raise just under $2 trillion over a decade the tax policy center estimates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related the 5 romney defines rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so any cap would raise even less</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has said a cap might be set at $17000 $25000 or $50000 and his campaign has said it could be adjusted to meet targets for revenue and income distribution</s>
<s>according to the tax policy center revenue generated would range from $763 billion under a $50000 cap to $17 trillion under a $17000 cap</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words a lower cap would raise more revenue because it would affect more people</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tax policy center stressed that its analysis isnt the final word on romneys plan since so many details are unknown</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but these new estimates suggest that romney will need to do much more than capping itemized deductions to pay for the roughly $5 trillion in rate cuts and other tax benefits he has proposed tax policy center senior fellow roberton williams wrote in a blog post</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed the campaign said a cap would not be the only way romney would seek to curb tax breaks</s>
<s>for example it could be paired with a curb on personal exemptions and the taxfree benefit workers receive when their employers help pay for their health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tax policy center also found that highincome households would bear the brunt of tax increases the higher the cap was set</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take a $50000 cap</s>
<s>in that scenario taxes would go up on 86 of those making more than $1 million in 2015</s>
<s>but only 64 of those making between $100000 and $200000 would get hit with tax increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contrast with a $17000 cap the vast majority of those making at least $1 million would still have a tax increase</s>
<s>but so too would nearly 42 of those in the $75000 to $100000 income group and 61 of those making between $100000 and $200000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a romney campaign spokesman dismissed the tax policy center report saying the researchers inserted their own assumptions in order to reach a biased conclusion</s>
<s> romneys tax reform principles establish a framework for working with congress to make the tax code more efficient and progrowth he said</s>
