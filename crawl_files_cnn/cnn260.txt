<s>a lot of people have trouble believing it but mitt romneys 141 average effective tax rate last year ranked pretty high compared to many other americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but how does romney stack up in the peer group he wants to join american presidents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>compared to other presidents over the past 40 years romneys tax rate is quite low</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is the lowest in fact since richard nixon who started the modern tradition of presidential tax disclosure when he got into hot water over those same low rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are many different ways to calculate average effective tax rates</s>
<s>romneys tax team in last weeks public announcement used this one total taxes divided by adjusted gross income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by that measure romney paid an average of 1402 over 2010 and 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a lot lower than president obamas average effective tax rate during his presidency of 2645</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romneys closest taxpaying peers would be bill clinton 2015 and george hw</s>
<s>bush 1986</s>
<s>those rates are a lot higher than romneys but other presidents have been higher still</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>george w bush whose signature tax cuts still dominate fiscal debate in washington paid 2717</s>
<s>fellow tax cutter ronald reagan paid 3237</s>

<p>
<s>why the rates vary there are several reasons why average rates vary so dramatically among presidents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a big part of the story is tax reform and tax reduction</s>
<s>over the decades rates generally have been headed down and presidents  like many of their fellow americans  have benefited from that trend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in theory tax reform has also eliminated tax preferences  a trend that should theoretically push average rates up as it got harder to shelter income from the taxman</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but for several presidents the rateraising effect of loophole elimination has been offset by the special low rate applied to capital gains and some dividends</s>
<s>thats the camp mitt romney would be in</s>
<s>his rate is so low principally because he gets a big chunk of his income from capital gains  something on the order of 65 to 75</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contrast most american presidents have relied much more heavily on various forms of regular income that dont get the rate preference accorded to capital gains</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related 4000 millionaires in romneys 47</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if he wins his race for the white house  and continues to file tax returns that look like the ones released during the campaign  president romney will have only richard nixon to keep him company at the bottom of the rate roster</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nixons rate was low 610 thanks to his extremely aggressive efforts at keeping it low</s>
<s>in particular he took a very large charitable deduction for donating his official papers to the national archives</s>
<s>he had accumulated most of those papers during his eight years as dwight eisenhowers vice president</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the time such donations and associated deductions were not uncommon</s>
<s>but nixon managed to get a very high valuation placed on his papers</s>
<s>that gave him a nice large deduction which he used to offset his income for several years</s>
<s>in 1970 and 1971 for instance the deduction almost completely wiped out his tax liability</s>
<s>his tax rate in those years was just 03</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eventually word of nixons tax avoidance leaked out and both congress and the irs investigated</s>
<s>in 1974 the president was forced to pay $465000 in back taxes and interest and some observers muttered darkly about the possibility of fraud charges</s>
<s>but the watergate scandal soon took center stage replacing tax avoidance as nixons most serious political problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no one has accused romney of anything like nixons aggressive tax avoidance</s>
<s>but nixons experience is still a cautionary tale</s>
<s>right or wrong americans care a lot about the taxes paid by their presidents</s>
<s>and given the way we started down this path of presidential tax disclosure americans might be forgiven if they want to pry a little</s>
