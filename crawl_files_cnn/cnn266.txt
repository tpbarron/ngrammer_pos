<s>there are still many questions about the taxes mitt romney paid over the last 20 years despite the release of a summary from his accountant friday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  after months of criticism for saying he would release only two years of tax returns mitt romney on friday put out a report from his accountants about taxes he has paid over 20 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the onepage document left key questions unanswered</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the report which summarized romneys tax returns from 1990 to 2009 was prepared by pricewaterhousecoopers one of the nations largest accounting firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the notarized letter said that romney and his wife ann never paid less than 1366 of their adjusted gross income in any one year</s>
<s>it said the average federal income tax bill came to 202 of income and the average state income payment was 836</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the letter did not give any dollar amounts of income or taxes paid</s>
<s>and it only referred to adjusted gross income rather than total income which can be substantially higher</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>adjusted gross income is not a full measure of income said roberton williams a senior fellow at the tax policy center</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>williams said the wealthy often use tax shelters and investments overseas to reduce their adjusted gross income and the resulting tax bite</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what youd like to know is what was his full income from all sources and what taxes did he pay williams said</s>
<s>that would give you an appropriate measure of his effective tax rate rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related kinda rich and really rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even the 202 average federal tax bill in the letter is likely overstated by at least a few percentage points williams said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because the accountants averaged the effective tax rates for each of the 20 years rather than compare total taxes paid to total adjusted gross income</s>
<s>this method gives too much weight to the years romney had a higher effective rate williams said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when asked friday the campaign would not provide any comparison of taxes paid to total income for the 20 years covered by the statement from the accountants</s>
<s>it also would not disclose what percentage of total adjusted gross income over the 20 years was paid in federal income taxes</s>
