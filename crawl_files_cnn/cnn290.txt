<s>new york cnnmoney  the twittersphere was aghast about the hefty $29 and $39 price tags apple is placing on adapters to connect the iphone 5 to old docks alarm clock radios and speaker systems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what a rip off</s>
<s> said chrisoldroyd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its time to gouge our customers for a ton more money disqus commenter dawsg4ever quipped</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its an absurdly high price to charge but making matters even worse those expensive adapters dont support video or a feature called ipod out</s>
<s> that means if you buy a $29 adapter so you can plug your iphone 5 into your speaker dock you wont be able to control your ipod through the dock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple aapl fortune 500 said nothing about that lack of functionality in its presentation on wednesday</s>
<s>but in its description of both the $29 and $39 adapters on its online store apple clearly says video and ipod out not supported</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the old 30pin connector that apple had been using on all ipods ipads and iphones since 2003 was able to send an analog signal out which many cars docks and other gadgets picked up to control the ipod and play music through their speakers</s>
<s>the new eightprong lightning adapter is all digital converting the analog signal to digital see correction below</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some older speaker docks and cars will still be able to play music from an iphone 5</s>
<s>but users wont be able to control their playlists through their car stereos or remote controls</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so whats the point of the adapter</s>
<s>apple says that its intelligent adapter will allow customers to connect the iphone 5 to many of your 30pin accessories</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the adapter can be used to charge iphone 5 phones through old docks or connect them to a pc via old cables for instance though apple will be supplying a lightningtousb adapter and a wall plug with its devices that will be able to accomplish that task</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most angry commenters were upset about the price but a few caught on to the lack of video and ipod out support</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>said misterfrosty so wont work with docs</s>
<s>utter madness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new lightning connector is 80 smaller than apples old one a feat that helped apple make the iphone 5 the thinnest iphone yet</s>
<s>some took to twitter to put the lightning snafu into perspective</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont think the iphone 5 is disappointing i just think people expected it to shoot unicorns out of its lightning connector said nasriatallah</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>correction an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the lightning adapter would not support audio out</s>
<s>the adapter will not support ipod controls but will support audio</s>
