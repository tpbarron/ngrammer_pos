</p>

<p>
<s>retail stores are likely to hold back their usual tv ad blitz</s>
<s>thats because the flood of political ads leading up to the nov 6 presidential election has increased the price of ad rates pushing aside pitches for early door buster deals</s>
<s>which means stores will have a short twoweek window after the election to lure shoppers with holiday ads for thanksgiving sales</s>
