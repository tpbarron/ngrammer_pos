<s>youtube gets a constant barrage of takedown requests related to copyright violations</s>

<s>new york cnnmoney  in a new campaign that started monday google is cracking down on copyright violators that show up in its search results</s>
<s>but at least one site that hosts a mother lode of pirated material wont see much of a change googles own youtube</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as part of the digital millennium copyright act copyright holders can request that google take down search links to urls that point to pirated material</s>
<s>google goog fortune 500 is adjusting its search algorithm to factor in the number of takedown requests it receives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sites with high numbers of removal notices may appear lower in our results amit singhal googles head of engineering said in a blog post</s>
<s>this ranking change should help users find legitimate quality sources of content more easily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the websites most likely to be ranked lower in googles search are sites like filestube and torrenthound which topped googles takedown request list last month</s>
<s>both sites give users ways to download copyrighted material for free</s>
<s>theyre pretty blatant  torrenthound even advertises pirated copies of intheaters movies like the dark knight rises and the amazing spiderman</s>

<p>
<s>youtube also hosts a huge amount of pirated material and receives numerous takedown requests google wouldnt discuss the exact number</s>
<s>however youtube is expected to emerge unscathed from googles search change</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google insists theres nothing nefarious going on</s>
<s>the company puts each website it crawls through about 200 different filters and both youtube and torrenthound are subjected to the same exact screening</s>
<s>youtubes heft  and the fact that millions rely on it for completely legal videoswapping  will keep it from sinking in the search rankings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google wouldnt detail how its various ranking tests work but a company spokesman said the intent is to promote the sites that users want to go to including youtube and other popular usergenerated content sites like facebook fb tumblr and amazon amzn fortune 500s imdb</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google is being especially cautious about this subject since the company is the target of ongoing antitrust investigations in both the united states and europe</s>
<s>those probes are looking at whether google unfairly promotes its own content above its rivals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that may be one reason why google is holding its own sites including youtube and blogger to extrastrict standards</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when tallying up the number of takedown requests for its own sites google is counting both the searchrelated takedown requests it receives as well as youtube and bloggers own separate copyrightrelated takedown requests</s>
<s>thats something google cant do for sites like facebook or tumblr since it doesnt have access to takedown requests sent to those companies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even with that exaggerated number google said youtubes search results rankings shouldnt appear much different than they have in the past</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not because were handpicking anything a google spokesman said</s>
<s>generally speaking were about promoting whats relevant to our users</s>
