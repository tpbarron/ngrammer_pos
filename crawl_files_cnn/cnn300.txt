<s>the issue youre grappling with boils down to this does it make sense to take smaller social security payments early in retirement so you take less money out of savings and give your nest egg a better chance to bulk up for later on</s>
<s>or does it make more sense to draw on your savings now and postpone social security for a number of years so youll receive a larger check from the government down the road</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a 62yearold who postpones social security until age 66 can boost his or her payment by a third not counting inflation increases or possibly even more if they work during those four years</s>

<p>
<s>the answer mostly depends on two things how much you expect you can reasonably earn on your retirement investments after inflation and how long you think youll live</s>
<s>assuming you earn 6 annually on your savings and inflation cruises along at 3 a year youre probably better off waiting for the larger social security payment you would receive at 66 rather than collecting as soon as youre eligible at 62</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the chart on the left shows youd only have to live to age 81 for it to be worth your while to wait</s>
<s>and unless youre in poor health or your family has a history of early departures its a good bet that you will</s>

<p>
<s>a 62yearold man has better than a 50 chance of living into his early to mideighties and the probability is greater than 60 for a woman according to ron gebhardtsbauer head of the actuarial sciences program at penn state</s>

<p>
<s>the longer you live beyond the breakeven age the more you come out ahead</s>
<s>it takes longer to break even however if you assume youll earn a higher inflationadjusted return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because it takes more time for the advantage of a bigger social security benefit to compensate for the higher level of earnings your portfolio is generating</s>
<s>so for example if you believe you can earn 8 a year while inflation cruises along at 3 annually  roughly a 5 real return  holding off would make sense only if you think youll live to 86</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but while that may make it seem tempting to take social security as early as possible and invest more aggressively remember invest with too much abandon in retirement and your portfolio could get whacked with serious losses jeopardizing your future security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two final caveats this sort of breakeven calculation makes sense only if youre confident youve got enough savings to carry you through retirement</s>
<s>if you dont have enough to sustain you then you may want to work a few more years says schwab retirement director beth chang</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the idea is that you dont want to run through your savings and have to live on social security alone</s>
<s>and dont forget that investment considerations arent the only things you should consider when deciding when to take social security</s>
