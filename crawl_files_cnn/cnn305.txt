<p>
<s>cisco systems csco announced wednesday that it is raising its dividend by 75</s>
<s>the move is a response to calls from shareholders who wanted the company to put more of its nearly $50 billion in cash or caysh if you talk like cisco ceo john chambers to productive use</s>
<s>once that dividend hike takes effect the yield on ciscos stock will be more than 3</s>
<s>by comparison the 10year treasury yields just 18</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>cisco whose shares surged nearly 8 thursday is not the only tech titan offering yields that rival uncle sams</s>
<s>shares of ibm ibm yield 17</s>
<s>texas instruments txn has a dividend that yields 23</s>
<s>microsofts msft stock yields 26</s>
<s>intel intc pays a dividend that yields 34</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while apples aapl newly issued dividend yields 17  slightly less than the 10year treasury bond apple should be in a position to keep increasing that dividend for many years to come thanks to its more than $110 billion in cash on hand</s>

<p>
<s>at this point many of these blue chip tech stocks offer the best of all worlds to investors growth income and value</s>
<s>with many consumers worried about the health of the economy a top tech seems like a much safer bet than us treasury bonds</s>

<p>
<s>related investors still view us debt as aaa for now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wouldnt you rather own a company like apple which continues to generate solid sales and profits from just about ieverything or microsoft which seems poised to hit it big with the upcoming windows 8 launch than the debt of a country thats faced with soaring budget deficits and a looming fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more none of the top techs trade at nosebleed valuations</s>
<s>they are all considerably cheaper than facebook fb which is still valued at 40 times 2012 earnings forecasts even though the companys stock price has been cut in half since its ipo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure some tech stocks have high dividend yields simply because their stock price has plunged thanks to concerns about their longterm health</s>
<s>remember that the yield is calculated by dividing the dividend by the stock price</s>
<s>hewlettpackard hpq has an impressivelooking yield of 27 but the stock is down 25 this year following a nearly 40 drop in 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related can anyone save hp</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as hp struggles to find its way in the new mobile world the companys dividend may not be as secure as apples or microsofts</s>
<s>and even if hp doesnt wind up cutting its dividend you still shouldnt be buying a stock just because it issues quarterly checks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after all many investors prefer to take the dividends and automatically reinvest in stock of the parent company</s>
<s>so a dividend from a tech stock should be an added bonus from a healthy company not a consolation prize to soften the blow of a sinking share price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fortunately hp is the exception not the rule</s>
<s>just about every top tech with a pristine balance sheet is now paying a dividend and the shares of all those companies are up this year</s>

<p>
<s>come on larry sergey and eric</s>
<s>what are you waiting for</s>
<s>dont be evil</s>
<s>start using some of that more than $48 billion in cash on a dividend</s>
<s>you dont need it all for acquisitions and research and development</s>
<s>a dividend doesnt have to mean youre throwing in the towel on innovation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tech companies are no longer being penalized for paying a dividend</s>
<s>in fact investors seem to be rewarding tech companies for doing the mature thing of returning cash to shareholders instead of wasting it on silly deals of little strategic value</s>
