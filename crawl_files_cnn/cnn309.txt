<s>the nations jobs gap stands at 9 million eight years after the recession began</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  america has added 5 million jobs since february 2010 when employment hit its great recession low</s>
<s>but the nation still needs to add another 9 million jobs just to get back to prerecession unemployment levels according to data crunched by the economic policy institute</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while that is a pretty big number the jobs gap is starting to shrink as the economy picks up steam</s>
<s>a year ago the deficit was 103 million jobs</s>
<s>and in september 2010 it was 113 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>weve reduced the gap but its still massive said heidi shierholz an economist at the leftleaning economic policy institute</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the improvements in the economy shouldnt mask the continued weakness of the labor market shierholz said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is still a lack of demand for workers with 38 million fewer jobs in the labor market now than before the recession</s>
<s>on top of that the labor market should also have added another 52 million jobs by now just to keep up with the growth in the workingage population over the past five years shierholz said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to eliminate the jobs deficit over the next three years the economy would have to add 330000 jobs a month  twice the rate it is today</s>
<s>at the current pace it would take until mid2020 to get back to an unemployment rate of 5 which is where it was in december 2007</s>
<s>the unemployment rate was 79 last month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets not forget how far we have to go she said</s>
<s>were in a big hole</s>
