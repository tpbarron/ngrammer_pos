</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  its the day some facebook employees have waited years for their paper wealth now has an official cash value to the tune of $52 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before this week those employees were rich only on paper</s>
<s>thats because facebook used a special form of equity compensation called restricted stock units that become actual tradeable stock only after a liquidity event  in this case facebooks may 18 ipo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebooks fb current and past employees hold about 225 million of those socalled rsus</s>
<s>they will officially be converted into stock on thursday using wednesdays closing price of $2323</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the shares will remain locked up for a few days</s>
<s>on monday october 29 their owners can cash in by selling them on the stock market</s>
<s>adding together the rsus and other stocks and options that are also being unlocked a total of 234 million shares will be newly eligible for sale that day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the employees rsus are worth around $52 billion based on wednesdays closing price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its less than they might have expected earlier in the year because facebook shares have plummeted since may</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebooks stock rose more than 19 on wednesday after the companys earnings report the night before</s>
<s>that was the biggest singleday gain since facebooks may ipo</s>
<s>wall street responded well to facebooks growing ad sales and efforts to monetize its growing pool of mobile users</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebooks employees wont take home every penny of their stock haul</s>
<s>they have to pay uncle sam first</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unlike stock options which traditionally carry a strike price at which recipients can purchase shares restricted stock units are granted outright at zero cost to employees</s>
<s>the irs taxes rsus as ordinary income on their full market value as of the day they vest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>employers are required to withhold taxes when they settle rsus</s>
<s>for many at facebook  whose windfalls can easily reach into the millions  that will mean paying taxes at the top income tax rate</s>
<s>thats 35 this year for federal taxes</s>
<s>california where most facebook employees live levies an additional 103 tax on individual income over $1 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebook says the tax rates will average around 45 so it plans to withhold 101 million of its employees 225 million shares to cover the bill</s>
<s>instead of selling those shares on the open market facebook will hang on to them and dip into its own cash stash and credit lines to pay the estimated tax bill of nearly $23 billion</s>
<s>the maneuver essentially functions like a stock buyback and reduces facebooks outstanding share count</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for facebooks rankandfile employees monday will be the first chance most have had to sell off some of their stock holdings and turn their paper wealth into actual cash</s>
<s>if a large number of them decide to sell immediately the stock could suffer a drop</s>
