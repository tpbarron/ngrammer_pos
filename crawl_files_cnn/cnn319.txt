</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  two years ago i met square ceo jack dorsey at third rail one of his favorite coffee shops in downtown new york</s>
<s>he held up a small plastic square and told me that the future of payments was in this tiny device</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the entire industry was about to change he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dorsey was in the middle of a major change himself</s>
<s>recently ousted from twitter the company he cofounded he rebounded by shifting his famously intense focus to a new pain point the way we pay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>squares pitch  a simple fee structure and technology that just works  was a quick hit with small merchants like third rail</s>
<s>square now has 2 million users and an annual transaction volume approaching $6 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that was just phase one it turns out</s>
<s>dorsey wasnt kidding about reinventing the entire concept of payments</s>
<s>last week he struck a partnership that will begin to bring his vision to the mass market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this fall starbucks sbux fortune 500 will begin accepting payments through squares mobile app</s>
<s>customers will be able to pay for their lattes by holding up their phone and allowing starbucks to automatically charge the customers card on the back end</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the first step</s>
<s>in the not too distant future dorsey and starbucks plan to let customers ditch their phones completely</s>
<s>all theyll need is the pay with square app which stores credit card numbers and other financial data and a name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the system uses the phones gps to detect that youve walked into a squareenabled retailer</s>
<s>the stores checkout software then automatically connects with your square app</s>
</p>

<p>

<s>related story the death of cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>square has been experimenting with that kind of almost invisible payment system at small shops like new yorks caf√© grumpy but starbucks can dramatically accelerate it</s>

</p>

<p>

<s>starbucks introduced its own paybyphone app last year and is now doing 1 million transactions a week through it according to ceo howard schultz</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i cant think of anything weve introduced in the last 40 years that had this kind of adoption schultz said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was schultz who reached out to dorsey</s>
<s>he had been contacted by a variety of companies focused on mobile payments over the last six months but turned his attention to square after adam brotman starbucks chief digital officer took the technology for a test drive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once jack and i sat down it was very obvious schultz said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>squares fee structure  a flat 275 fee per credit card swipe  is a better fit for small businesses than large ones which have the heft to negotiate better terms with their payment processors</s>
<s>starbucks appears to have scored a break from square to lure it aboard schultz said the company will save money through the arrangement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a starbucks representative wouldnt elaborate on the financial terms saying only that it will be a reduced cost over what our current provider is charging us</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>will this open the door to bringing other big brands aboard</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were open to large retail medium retailers  we want this to be a general transaction experience that benefits everyone dorsey said</s>
