</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  the 401k is the best tool you have to save for retirement but it can be an awfully clumsy one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a typical plan your employer essentially hands you a list of funds and says here you pick</s>
<s> maybe you spend a weekend agonizing over whether to invest in this stock fund that looks for opportunities for value or this other one that goes after emerging opportunities</s>
<s> both sound great</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for some finetuning a retirement portfolio becomes a fascinating pursuit for most it falls somewhere between tedious housekeeping and an anxietyprovoking puzzle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the catastrophic market crash of 2008 which took the average 401k balance down by 30 has done lasting damage to the confidence of savers</s>
<s>even though the sp 500 spx had doubled from its low only 14 of workers at the start of 2012 were very confident about their retirement prospects compared with 27 in 2007</s>

<s>with $235 billion under management dimensional has quietly built a reputation as one of the most sophisticated fund managers in the business</s>
<s>its lowcost indexlike funds have acquired a mystique in part because they are mainly sold to institutions and clients of feeonly advisers</s>

<s>and he has a proposition that may surprise you you should be able to all but ignore your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the decisions you must get right are all about planning  how much to save how much income youll need  not investing</s>

<p>
<s>dimensionals managed dc service which was launched in the us this summer is an intriguing entry in a small but growing category of managed 401k plans</s>
<s>competitors include the more established financial engines and a firm called guided choice recently tapped by schwab to offer advice built around the brokerage giants index funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what all the services have in common is that they set up and run a portfolio for each participant in a 401k plan based on his or her age savings and income goals</s>
<s>you can use one of these programs only if your employer makes it an option</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so when you log on to your plans website you wont be given a menu of funds you can move money in and out of</s>

<p>
<s>it remains to be seen whether over the long run a custom approach will improve 401k savers outcomes</s>

<p>
<s>bright idea no</s>
<s>1 you wont win by becoming a brilliant investor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not that owning good funds is irrelevant</s>
<s>over the past 15 years the bestperforming largecap stock fund beat the sp 500 index by an annualized 62 percentage points</s>
<s>if you happened to pick that winner in advance then yes that would have made a big difference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>trouble is over the past decade 60 of actively managed us largecap funds underperformed the sp according to sp dow jones indices</s>
<s>and the noise of the market often drives fund investors to buy and sell at the wrong times</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from 2000 to 2009 the average fund earned an annual 32</s>
<s>morningstar data show the return to the shareholders  measured by tracking money flows in and out  was about half as much</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can work to getting better at investing but the evidence is that this wont get you far</s>
<s>for some savers farming out investment choices would be a relief</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the majority of 401k participants are not particularly informed about investing decisions nor are they very interested says christopher jones chief investment officer at financial engines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for those used to playing a more active role though taking a handsoff approach might not be so easy</s>
<s>managed plans are generally take it or leave it you cant swap some of their picks for your own ideas</s>
<s>and you have to pay for the service</s>
<s>some advisers charge up to 06 on top of fund costs dimensional uses its own broadly diversified portfolios and charges a flat 06</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>although the managed services pick the funds youll hold financial engines and guidedchoice do allow you to change your exposure to stocks depending on your comfort level</s>
<s>at the same time their calculators instantly show how raising your risk could lower your income if markets are poor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dimensional takes a more radical approach it never asks about your appetite for risk</s>
<s>it sets an asset allocation it calculates will give you the best shot at hitting your income goals  a strategy that will vary depending on your savings and time to retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dimensional thinks risk tolerance is too wobbly a concept</s>
<s>when stocks soar everyone has a stomach for risk after losses many aggressive investors realize that they want out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if people answered risk questionnaires accurately no one would be in equities says michael lane head of dimensionals retirement business</s>
<s>we dont ask questions that at the end of the day dont matter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do it on your own if you cant or wont turn over control of your money train yourself to mess with it less often</s>
<s>one way to do that is to not stray too far from a moderate asset allocation perhaps an agebased rule like 100 or 110 minus your age in stocks</s>
<s>that way when the market crashes youre less likely to be gripped by an urgent need to act</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bright idea no</s>
<s>2 its not about hitting the number</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the way you measure success in a standard 401k plan is by getting as close as you can to a savings target aka</s>
<s>your number</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mathematically theres nothing wrong with setting a number</s>
<s>psychologically though its far too fuzzy what looks like a huge stash may not be enough to produce the income you need</s>
<s>even $1 million doesnt go that far anymore says olivia mitchell a pensions expert at the university of pennsylvania</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>following the popular 4 rule of thumb would leave you with an initial income of $40000</s>

<s>we need to get the focus off of cash piles and onto cash flows says alicia munnell of the center for retirement research at boston college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new 401k plans constantly track your progress in terms of your likely income in retirement</s>
<s>for example you might see a dollar range based on your current savings habits planned retirement age and social security benefit</s>
<s>they also help you estimate how much youll need</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dimensional for example separates that into two buckets money you need to cover essential costs like food and health care premiums and funds for luxuries such as an annual vacation</s>
<s>that distinction becomes especially important late in your career as dimensional decides how much risk to take with your portfolio</s>
<s>see bright idea no 4</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you have less than a 15 probability of achieving your desired income goal dimensionals software could even force you to alter your plan  by saving more for example or accepting a lower future income or later retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related are you saving enough for retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but sherrie grabot ceo of guidedchoice says that even the simple exercise of showing savers how much income their nest egg will probably generate is powerful</s>
<s>people understand how much their monthly bills are she says</s>
<s>if the numbers dont match up they know they cant afford to retire</s>
<s>they get it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do it on your own managed 401k plans generally try to get you to between 70 and 80 of your preretirement income including social security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the free retirement income calculator on the website of t rowe price sets a 75 goal and is a good way to get a ballpark estimate</s>
<s>if you want to depend less on market fortunes try plugging in a conservative portfolio rather than t rowes suggested allocation and see how much youd have to save to make that work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bright idea no 3 and its not about watching your balance grow either</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another consequence of focusing on the pile of money is that checking your balance can make a bear market look like a much bigger setback than it really is especially for savers 20 years or more from retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>grabot says that stocks could drop 40 but a younger saver might see only a 5 to 10 drop in his probable income</s>
<s>thats a very different feeling she says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how can that be</s>
<s>first the income youll be able to tap in retirement is driven by more than your portfolio</s>
<s>theres also your social security as well as interest rates which affect the value of an incomeproducing annuity you might choose to buy when you retire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even more important for the young is the fact that the investment portfolio you have today is just a fraction of the nest egg youll be building up with contributions over the rest of your career</s>
<s>and when stocks drop that means your future contributions are actually buying more shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do it on your own if you are a couple of decades away from retirement stay focused on the bigger picture during bear markets</s>

<p>
<s>youre getting stocks on sale says christine fahlund a senior financial planner at t rowe price</s>
<s>as you get nearer to your retirement date however your balance  and what you do with it  will matter a lot more</s>
<s>which brings us to the last bright idea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bright idea no 4 take money off the table when you hit goals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as you age you know that you are supposed to reduce your exposure to equities</s>
<s>that is the key selling point of targetdate mutual funds which make this shift automatically for you</s>
<s>but theyre a fairly blunt instrument</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reducing risk should not be about age only says david wray of the plan sponsor council of america a trade group for employers offering 401ks it should also be about the accumulation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words once you have built up enough to pay for certain key needs in retirement why keep that money at risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related the truth behind targetdate funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dimensionals approach to this question is unusual</s>
<s>within 15 years of retirement dimensional looks at your bareminimum income goal and starts shifting money into a separate bucket of investments that it calculates will provide a 96 chance of hitting that number</s>
<s>dimensional stresses that this is not a guarantee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money beyond the essentials can be invested more aggressively</s>
<s>by retirement much of the essential portfolio will be in funds holding treasury inflationprotected securities or tips</s>
<s>that idea may be a tough sell these days with treasury yields still at crazy lows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem is mitigated however for those who plan to put the money into an annuity at retirement which dimensional strongly encourages</s>
<s>if interest rates climb the bond funds will take a hit to their returns but payouts on annuities will also be higher</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do it on your own its not easy to replicate a strategy like dimensionals on your own</s>
<s>but thinking ahead about how youll pay for your essential needs  not the cruise you might one day like to take but the regular grocery shopping and property tax bills that cant be put off  can help you avoid taking too much risk as you near retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you could easily be retired for 20 or 30 years so it may seem like you have lots of time to wait out a bad market and capture stocks higher longrun return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once youve stopped working however a market drop will be devastating if youre suddenly forced to turn longterm investments into gas money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people have been focusing on the rate of return and how much they can accumulate says lane</s>
<s>thats what most 401k plans with their emphasis on investments instead of planning to replace income train you to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as you get closer to the end of your career instead of counting on riding the bull to a successful retirement you need to start thinking about how youll break the fall should you get thrown</s>
