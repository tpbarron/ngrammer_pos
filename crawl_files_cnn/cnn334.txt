<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  republicans may soon lose a key talking point</s>
<s>according to data released thursday president obama may now be a net job creator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the year following obamas inauguration the us economy lost about 43 million jobs</s>
<s>but new figures released thursday show 44 million jobs have been added back since then</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres how it happened since early 2010 jobs have slowly been trickling back particularly in professional services health care and manufacturing</s>
<s>as of august the labor department had indicated about 4 million jobs had been recovered overall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those figures get revised frequently though as the labor department gets more complete data over time</s>
<s>on thursday the labor department released a statement saying it crunched the numbers again using unemployment insurance records that employers are required to file</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>based on that data the government now believes it undercounted jobs created in much of 2011 by around 386000</s>
<s>thats according to preliminary figures that the government could still tweak slightly in february</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if true those figures mean the economy has recovered 44 million jobs since early 2010  enough to fully account for the jobs lost in obamas first term</s>
<s>in fact obama would be ahead by exactly 125000 jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related economic growth revised lower</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the president is unlikely to brag about that on the campaign trail though</s>
<s>in a blog post thursday his top economic adviser in the white house alan krueger said the new data shows the jobs recovery over the last 25 years has been a bit stronger than initially reported although much work remains to be done to return to full employment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile republican nominee mitt romney still has plenty of fodder to criticize obama on economic issues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>president obamas administration promised with the passage of the stimulus that unemployment would currently be at 54 with 9 million more people working romney campaign spokeswoman andrea saul said in a statement referring to a 2009 report by obamas then chief economic adviser christina romer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with unemployment at 8 or higher for the 43rd consecutive month and 23 million americans struggling for work president obamas policies have failed miserably by his own standards saul added</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given that the jobs decline started before obama entered office employment is still far below 2007 levels</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hiring has barely been strong enough to keep up with population growth and thats why the unemployment rate is still stuck at 81</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a survey of households shows the us population has grown 38 since obama entered office but jobs have only grown by 15 over that same time period</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>about 125 million americans were still counted as unemployed in august</s>
