<s>college is just like anything else you usually get what you pay for</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some lowcost colleges for example have lowquality instructors and high dropout rates</s>
<s>and since dropping out of college is one of the most expensive mistakes you can make in life it makes a lot more sense to attend the best college you can afford  not the cheapest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the good news is that even some of the most expensive colleges are making tuition more affordable for some students</s>
<s>harvard for example charges a maximum of 10 of family income for students from families earning up to $150000</s>
<s>the university of connecticut offers some halftuition scholarships to a few top students every year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because colleges are increasingly charging each student a more customized price no general list can tell you which college will be cheap for you</s>
<s>you can try to estimate your net cost at any particular school using our tool</s>
<s>but heres some general advice on how to find lowcost colleges of $5000 or less and courses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>public community colleges these schools generally have the lowest sticker and net prices especially if you live at home while studying</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the average community college charged tuition and fees of about $3000 a year in the 201112 academic year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>traditionally community colleges only offered the first two years worth of classes requiring students to transfer to other colleges and universities in order to earn their bachelors</s>
<s>now a growing number are starting to offer full fouryear bachelors degrees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but beware some community colleges have very low graduation rates meaning a lot of students drop out</s>
<s>colleges are required to tell you their graduation rate</s>
<s>so if you can shop around call the colleges you are considering to ask about their graduation rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>study on your own and test out</s>
<s>for those who are disciplined enough you can study topics like american history psychology and marketing then pay less than $100 typically to take a test that many community colleges consider the equivalent of a college final exam</s>
<s>if you pass many colleges will give you credit or at least allow you to place into higherlevel courses</s>
