<s>student loans are made for the sole purpose of helping students pay for their education and related expenses</s>
<s>most lenders allow students to delay their payments until after they graduate or drop out</s>
<s>but these loans are expected to be repaid with interest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while student loans can help you afford a steep college bill there are many pitfalls they present as well</s>
<s>unlike almost any other kind of loan credit card advances mortgages etc</s>
<s> it is very difficult to free yourself of student loan debt if you get into financial trouble and file for bankruptcy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal government can even wait until you retire and take some of your social security payments to recoup its loans</s>
<s>thats why its important to keep your borrowing to an absolute minimum and after you leave school make sure you make your payments on time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here are three basic types of student loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us department of education will lend at least $5500 a year to just about any undergraduate without requiring parents to guarantee repayment and with almost no regard to the students credit history</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2012 the government was charging between 5 and 7 for its student loans</s>
<s>it offered several repayment options including incomebased repayment and pay as you earn which link your monthly payments to your earnings</s>
<s>and it offered public servants a chance for some loan forgiveness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are a few kinds of students the federal government wont make loans to however</s>
<s>those include undocumented students or those who have already defaulted on a previous federal student loan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many banks and private companies like sallie mae which is no longer run by the government also make student loans</s>
<s>these are standard lending transactions that are very similar to say auto loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>loans from private lenders are generally less advantageous to students for several reasons</s>
<s>private lenders wont make loans directly to college students because they have limited credit histories and are unable to prove theyll be able to pay the loan back</s>
<s>as a result lenders often require parents to cosign or guarantee in writing that they will pay back the loan if the student fails to do so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition private student loans generally arent eligible for public service forgiveness programs in which graduates who work for nonprofits or government agencies can have a portion of their loans erased</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a few charities and colleges offer low or in some cases nointerest student loans</s>
<s>these are comparatively rare however</s>
<s>and not all collegemade loans are good deals</s>
</p>
