<s>six months after you stop taking courses at least halftime  whether or not youve graduated  your federal student loan bills starting coming due</s>

<p>
<s>even if youve moved and havent received a bill in the mail you still owe uncle sam</s>

<s>failing to pay your federal student loan on time is very costly</s>
<s>the government charges late fees and  if you let your bills go unpaid for too long  collection fees</s>
<s>and of course they report your delinquency to the credit bureaus which makes it hard for you to get a credit card car loan mortgage or in some cases certain kinds of jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the good news is that there is no penalty for paying down the loan ahead of time</s>
<s>and the government has many different kinds of payment plans that can reduce the pain of those bills</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>incomebased repayment plan</s>
<s>these plans cap eligible students payments based on what they earn making it easier for lowincome earners to afford their loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2012 incomebased repayment plans allow you to cap your monthly payments at a maximum of 15 of your disposable income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>public servants such as teachers police officers and social workers who sign up for this option and make 120 ontime payments 10 years worth can have any remaining balance forgiven</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but to keep this option you must send the department of education information documenting your annual income</s>
<s>every year your income increases your monthly loan payment will increase a little as well</s>
<s>here are some basic stats</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>standard 10year repayment</s>
<s>if you dont try for one of the alternates this is the repayment plan youll automatically be assigned to</s>
<s>if you can manage to keep to the standard schedule youll pay off your loans in a reasonable amount of time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>graduated repayment plan</s>
<s>the graduated plan starts out with low payments but then raises them by about $50 every two years so that you pay off the loan in 10 years</s>
<s>its best for students who are certain their income will rise quickly after graduation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>4</s>
<s>extended repayment plan</s>
<s>you can ask to make smaller monthly payments for more years by stretching out the payments from the standard 10 years to as many as 25 years with an extended plan</s>
<s>of course that means youll end up paying a lot more in the end</s>
