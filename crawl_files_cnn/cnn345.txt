<p>
<s>though the presidential candidates both say they want to keep taxes low for the middle class they have very different ideas about what highincome households should pay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  when it comes to taxes the 2012 presidential election comes down to one question how much should the rich pay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after months of debate americans on tuesday must choose between two presidential candidates who have starkly different views on the issue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they both say they want to keep taxes low on the middle class which both define broadly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but president barack obama wants highincome households to pay higher tax rates on income and investments</s>
<s>his stated goals to help reduce deficits to help the country make critical investments and to increase fairness in the tax code</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mitt romney doesnt think taxes should play a role in deficit reduction</s>
<s>rather he wants to embark on revenueneutral tax reform</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney wants to cut everyones income tax rates by 20 but wants the top 5 of households to pay the same share of taxes they do today</s>
<s>to ensure that he plans to rein in their tax breaks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one tax break he doesnt want to touch the lower rates they pay on their capital gains and dividends which are often major sources of their income</s>
<s>related why corporate taxes may go up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one other point of difference between the two obama wants to preserve the estate tax and romney wants to get rid of it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres a closer look at what each candidate has proposed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>individual income tax rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>currently the bushera tax rates are 10 15 25 33 and 35</s>
<s>those rates are scheduled to expire at the end of the year and higher rates will take their place</s>
<s>the increases would affect those who report wage and business income on individual returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would make those rates permanent for everyone except those making more than $200000 $250000 if married</s>
<s>for those highincome households obama would preserve the rates at the low end 10 15 and 25 but raise the top two rates to 36 and 396</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would reduce each of the bushera income tax rates by 20</s>
<s>so the top rate would fall to 28 and the bottom rate would fall to 8</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would also like to repeal the 2010 health reform law</s>
<s>if he succeeds that would mean a repeal of the 09 percentage point increase in the medicare tax on highincome households called for under that law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>alternative minimum tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>currently unless congress makes special adjustments for inflation to the amount of income exempt from the amt the socalled wealth tax would hit tens of millions in the middle class</s>
<s>making the adjustment is costly getting rid of the amt altogether is really costly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would permanently adjust the amt for inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would abolish the amt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investment income tax rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>longterm capital gains and qualified dividends are currently taxed at 15</s>
<s>interest is subject to ordinary income tax rates</s>
<s>for those at or below the 15 income tax bracket however they have a 0 capital gains and dividend rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would raise the capital gains rate to 20 and tax dividends at ordinary income tax rates for those making more than $200000 $250000 if married</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would maintain the current 15 investment income tax rate but exempt from taxation all capital gains dividends and interest for those with adjusted gross incomes up to $100000 $200000 for married couples</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>repeal of the health reform law would result in the elimination of the new 38 medicare tax on investment income for highincome households</s>
<s>the new tax is scheduled to go into effect next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>carried interest tax rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>managers of private equity venture capital and hedge funds are taxed at 15 on the portion of their compensation known as carried interest  which represents a share of the profits from the funds they manage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would tax carried interest as ordinary income meaning rates for fund managers would more than double</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has said in the past that the rate should not be raised</s>
<s>but during this campaign cycle romneys advisers have left open the possibility that hed consider increasing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax breaks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax credits deductions and other breaks reduce revenue by more than $1 trillion every year</s>
<s>to pay for lower income tax rates and reduce deficits many breaks  including the largest and most popular  have to be eliminated or curtailed experts say</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama has proposed limiting the value of itemized deductions and other tax breaks such as exclusions for those with adjusted gross income over $200000</s>
<s>today many filers in that group can deduct 33 or 35 of a qualified expense</s>
<s>obama would limit that to 28</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama also has proposed making permanent some expanded tax breaks for the middle class such as one for college costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has promised to pay for his $5 trillion tax plan by curbing tax breaks primarily for highincome filers</s>
<s>one idea hes mentioned capping the total value of ones itemized deductions</s>
<s>thats not sufficient to pay for his plan though</s>
<s>if thats the route he chooses he might also curb the value of personal exemptions and the taxfree benefit workers get when their employers provide their health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>estate tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>until the end of this year only estates valued at more than $512 million are subject to an estate tax up to a 35 top rate</s>
<s>barring congressional action all estates worth more than $1 million will be subject to the estate tax at a top rate of 55 next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would reinstate the estate tax at 2009 levels  meaning estates worth more than $35 million would be subject to the tax and face a top rate of 45</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would repeal the estate tax but preserve the gift tax rate at 35</s>
</p>
