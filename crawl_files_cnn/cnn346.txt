<s>new york cnnmoney  my 401k is managed by a brokerage firm that was busted by the sec for fraudulent practices although those practices werent related to my 401k plan</s>
<s>still i dont want to invest my money with or pay fees to to a firm i consider unethical</s>
<s>for now ive switched all of my money into the bond account figuring its the safest place to invest until i can figure out what to do</s>
<s>but id really like to get into another 401k plan</s>
<s>can i do that</s>

<p>
<s>the short answer is probably not without considerable effort</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your 401k plan is tied to your job</s>
<s>unless you start working for another employer that offers a 401k and accepts rollovers from other company plans  as most do  youre pretty much stuck with your current 401k even if you consider the firm that manages it ethically challenged</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said you might be able to move some of your money out of your 401k and into another taxadvantaged account</s>
<s>but even that may be easier said than done</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one option would be to roll your 401k into an ira</s>
<s>but you would still have to leave your employer to make the move</s>
<s>you cant just do a rollover whenever you want while youre still working at your current firm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another possibility might be to take whats known as an inservice distribution</s>
<s> this would allow you to draw certain funds from your 401k while youre still employed by your company</s>
<s>you could then roll that distribution into an ira account</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the hitch here is that your plan has to offer inservice distributions</s>
<s>and even though the majority of plans do there are restrictions as to which funds are eligible for such withdrawals</s>
<s>most companies limit such withdrawals to older employees</s>
<s>you can check with your human resources department or your 401k custodian to see if an inservice distribution is an alternative for you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those are pretty much your choices outside of something really extreme like taking out a 401k loan and investing the proceeds a move that in my opinion would make no sense</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can stop new money from going into your 401k however by stopping your contributions to your plan</s>
<s>you could then contribute to a traditional or roth ira account assuming you qualify</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but this tactic has potential drawbacks</s>
<s>the maximum you can contribute each year to an ira is now $5000 $6000 if youre 50 or older</s>
<s>the max for 401ks is much higher $17000 starting this year  $22500 including the $5500 catchup for participants 50 and older  although companies can effectively set lower ceilings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the point is if youre currently salting away more than the ira max in your 401k switching to an ira would dilute your taxadvantaged savings effort</s>
<s>and if your employer is matching any portion of your 401k contributions youd lose those funds too further reducing the eventual size of your nest egg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you believe your 401k money is truly in jeopardy because of fraud or malfeasance on the part of the company overseeing the plan you should immediately inform your employer as well as the department of labors employee benefit security administration</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2010 ebsa launched a crackdown on fraud albeit infrequent in 401ks and similar plans and as part of that effort is offering a list of 10 warning signs that your 401k contributions may be being misused</s>
<s>but it sounds like youre more concerned about the principle here</s>
<s>you dont like having your retirement funds entrusted to a company you feel doesnt act in an ethical way</s>
<s>that stance is perfectly reasonable particularly in light of financial shenanigans in recent years</s>
<s>i dont see why you shouldnt bring it to your employers attention</s>
<s>if there are other employees who feel the same way you might make your case as a group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course your employer may not see it your way for any number of reasons</s>
<s>and even if your company does decide to make a change that could take a while</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my take is that it wouldnt make sense to jeopardize your retirement security because of the actions of a firm that you neither chose nor had any control over</s>
<s>if i were in your position id probably stay in the plan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ultimately youve got to follow your own ethical compass</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whatever you decide i dont think putting all your money into the bond account is a good move as your entire balance would get whacked if interest rates rise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so while youre mulling your options keep your account in a diversified mix of stock and bond funds thats appropriate for your age and tolerance for risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that may not help with your ethical quandary</s>
<s>but it will assure that your 401k remains properly invested until you resolve it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an earlier version of this story stated the maximum ira contribution as $17500 and the catchup contribution for participants 50 and older as $5000Â </s>
