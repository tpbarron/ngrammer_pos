<s>capping itemized deductions alone wont pay for mitt romneys $5 trillion tax plan</s>
<s>but he could get closer to his goal if hes willing to curb the tax break for buying health insurance at work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  among the questions about how mitt romney would pay for his $5 trillion tax plan is whether he would curb the biggest tax break of all the largely invisible tax savings workers get when their employer provides health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the health care exclusion applies to the money a company contributes to help pay for an employees coverage that money is considered income to the worker and the irs treats it as taxfree</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and employers pay the lions share of health insurance costs</s>
<s>in 2012 the average family plan cost $15745 according to the kaiser family foundation</s>
<s>of that employers paid $11429</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>roughly 160 million americans benefit from the break</s>
<s>and it will cost federal coffers more than $150 billion in revenue annually going forward</s>
<s>that puts it at the top of the more than $1 trillion in federal tax breaks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but most people dont realize they benefit from the exclusion because they dont have to report it on their tax returns</s>
<s>starting this year employers will include the value of workers health insurance on their w2s for informational purposes only</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so where does romney stand on the exclusion</s>
<s>it appears he is leaving his options open</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the one hand romney has spoken about possibly putting a dollarcap on itemized deductions to help pay for his plan</s>
<s>his campaign added that such a cap could be done in conjunction with curbs on among other things the health care exclusion</s>
<s>the curbs would primarily affect the wealthy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or the campaign said he could choose to leave the health exclusion exactly as is</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related the top 5 romney defines rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in either case romney has committed to offering an equivalent tax break to those who buy insurance on their own the campaign said</s>
<s>right now the only people who enjoy a tax break for buying health insurance are those who do so through their employer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how would romney level the playing field</s>
<s>there are a lot of ways to do it but theres not a fully formed plan a romney policy official said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course how its done will determine whether it helps to pay for his tax plan or simply increases its cost</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>adding a new tax break for those buying insurance on their own on top of the current exclusion for employerbased plans will cost more money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if instead romney chose to offer the same tax break to everyone  regardless of how they buy their insurance  there are ways to reduce the hit to federal coffers and help pay for his plan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example he could replace the exclusion with a tax credit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>right now the exclusion is unlimited</s>
<s>but a tax credit which is a dollarfordollar reduction of ones tax bill could be set up so it limits the benefit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how</s>
<s>if the credit is set at a low enough rate or limitations are placed on the amount subject to the credit the value of the health tax break for many people could be reduced</s>
<s>and no one more so than the rich</s>
<s>thats because they pay the highest tax rates and so now benefit most from todays unlimited taxfree exclusion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but without firmer details about the direction romney would choose its impossible to say how much of a role if any americas biggest tax break will play in his promise to pay for his $5 trillion tax plan</s>
