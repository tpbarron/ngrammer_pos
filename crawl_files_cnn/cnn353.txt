<s>id been promoted twice and now that i was second in command there wasnt much room to grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eckholm was ready to have his own name on the door but taking the first step was scary</s>
<s>after months of research he set his sights on san diego</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i knew there werent art handling and storage companies in the area he says</s>
<s>and with his contacts from cookes eckholm figured he could drum up clients there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the summer of 2006 he tested that theory by pitching himself to museums and private collectors</s>
<s>the response was overwhelmingly positive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>through a business associate eckholm even met a wealthy art lover who was so confident in the idea that he was willing to fund the majority of startup costs in exchange for a stake in the firm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by may 2007 eckholm had handed in his resignation rented a 10000squarefoot warehouse in san diego and put his la home up for sale</s>
<s>he didnt want to uproot his wife and two teenage sons until their house had sold though so he headed south solo</s>

<s>some 85 of that came from the san diego investor</s>
<s>while he had to give up 80 of the company eckholm has no regrets my investor helps with decisions which is more than a bank would do</s>
<s> the rest came from a private loan and his own savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>portion of savings eckholm used 95</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eckholm hasnt yet replenished his cash cushion but since 2009 hes been putting $300 a month into an ira</s>
