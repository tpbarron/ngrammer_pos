<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the federal reserves policymaking committee is meeting for the next two days and it is widely expected to announce a third round of quantitative easing known as qe3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even if the fed launches that third bondbuying spree it is unlikely to have a major positive effect on the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the impact would be microscopic at best said catherine mann a brandeis university finance professor and former federal reserve economist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fed continues to want the economy to grow faster and specifically to grow more jobs but the ability of qe to do that is extraordinarily limited she said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fed could buy treasury bonds mortgage backed securities or both</s>
<s>economists at goldman sachs predict qe3 could total $50 billion in purchases a month and the end date could be left up in the air depending on the strength of the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related investors and economists agree no qe3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the hope is that such a program will lower interest rates further translating into cheap borrowing for businesses consumers and homebuyers</s>
<s>in turn more lending could lead to more hiring</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres the problem though the more easing that the fed does the less impact it has on the broader economy</s>
<s>even the fed admits as much</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there may be some diminishing returns and that would be a consideration wed have to look at as we try to analyze what our options are fed chairman ben bernanke said in june</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>poll will the fed launch qe3 on thursday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield on 10year treasury bonds  considered the benchmark interest rate in the united states  is now around 17 not far from the alltime low reached in july</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even record low interest rates have yet to spur much lending by banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we know that qe reduced interest rates but we also know that has not led to more construction more mortgages more business investment or more lending mann said</s>
<s>since it hasnt done any of that it probably hasnt created jobs either</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile banks are sitting on $15 trillion in excess reserves and havent been eager to lend that money out</s>
<s>in fact low interest rates make it harder for them to turn a profit on new loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still some economists say qe3 could be modestly helpful</s>
<s>it may drive stocks higher</s>
<s>it could also support the nascent recovery in the housing market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mortgage rates are indirectly related to the feds policies and in july they fell to their lowest level on record</s>
<s>that same month permits to build new homes picked up to their highest level in four years</s>
<s>home prices have started to rise too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related what the fed should do but probably wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if mortgage rates fall even further could that help</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mark gertler an economist at new york university believes qe3 could have a positive impact on the economy if it included mortgagebacked securities</s>
<s>he estimates that if the fed were to buy another $500 billion to $600 billion in assets the central bank could possibly lower interest rates about a tenth of a percentage point more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were not talking about a major form of stimulus but given the job market is still unsettled it could be useful he said</s>
<s>everything else being equal credit will be cheaper</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that stands in contrast to the first two rounds of qe</s>
<s>totaling $23 trillion those programs are thought to have lowered the 10year yield by one full percentage point and created roughly 2 million jobs according to research cited by bernanke in jackson hole wyo</s>
<s>two weeks ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however if qe1 and qe2 created 2 million jobs it seems reasonable to suggest that a third smaller round would have an even smaller impact on job creation</s>
<s>although any gains would be welcome the labor market remains in a deep hole</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the united states still needs to recover 47 million jobs just to get back to 2008 employment levels</s>
<s>the population has grown and as of august 125 million people remained unemployed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at this point the feds power pales in comparison to the potential impact congress could have by addressing fiscal cliff fears said dean croushore an economics professor at the university of richmond and a former fed economist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>businesses are not hesitant to invest and hire because interest rates are too high  theyre hesitant because of the uncertainty surrounding their future prospects he said</s>
