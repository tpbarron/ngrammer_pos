<s>making insurance claims is the next step for shops damaged by sandy</s>
<s>for restaurants like jerrys cafe that lost power that includes loads of spoiled food</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  few small business owners were insured for a storm like sandy but even those that were might be in for some nasty surprises</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>business interruption insurance is one example</s>
<s>it helps companies if theyre temporarily shut down</s>
<s>but most small companies dont have it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and those that do might not see any benefit it usually kicks in only if theres physical damage  no help to a business that was spared flood damage but had to remain closed because floods kept customers away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>issues like that will cause lots of squabbling between business owners and their insurers and theyll take a lot of time to resolve</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>itll probably take two years or more before were whole again said loretta worters vice president of the insurance information institute which is paid for by insurance companies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what can businesses expect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>documentation is the first step and its what employees at jerrys caf√© in lower manhattan were doing last week</s>
<s>they took photographs of every item they had to chuck outside swiss cheese eggs milk and more</s>
<s>food spoilage insurance covers whatever rotted in the fridge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>recording losses  by jotting down serial numbers or taking photos  is key to any claim and it will prove a tough task for most small businesses which rarely keep thorough paperwork on inventory and equipment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related 19 bags of rotting food and a business at risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>damage assessment from claims adjusters comes next and businesses might have to wait weeks for their turn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for their part insurance companies are trying to make it easier</s>
<s>before the storm travelers insurance had already dedicated 5000 employees to assess damage and answer questions</s>
<s>immediately after the storm it sent five rvs to serve as mobile claims offices in hardhit areas of new jersey and new york</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another major insurer liberty mutual has 60 adjusters in the area physically inspecting 1500 claims</s>
<s>chief commercial claims officer george neale said all businesses will be visited in the next two weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we work hard to try to get our people back in business as soon as possible and deliver on our promise said neale</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>businesses that think the wait will be too long  or that the insurers adjuster wont give a fair estimate  could choose to hire their own adjusters to get repair estimates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but that can be risky said ervin gonzalez a south florida attorney who fought against builders and insurers for shoddy practices after 1992s hurricane andrew</s>
<s>gonzalez said that there arent enough adjusters in the new york area so thousands of them will travel from across the country looking for work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some will overcharge taking 20 or more of what an insurer will eventually pay  much higher than the 10 cap for residential properties in states like florida</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gonzalez also warned that independent adjusters who land contract work for insurers have incentive to offer business owners less than what their loss is worth because these contractors want the insurer to hire them again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we saw that with hurricane katrina in new orleans and after hurricane andrew in miami gonzalez said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related what to expect when filing sandy insurance claims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the last step settling the claim could be the most precarious  and disappointing</s>
<s>small business owners in florida know that well especially after hurricane andrew which sparked a wave of lawsuits from those who felt their claims got lowballed if they received money at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the old age of buildings in new jersey and new york are likely to play a factor</s>
<s>insurers could blame some of the damage on age instead of the storm as was the case for miami attorney philippe lieberman</s>
<s>he went through great pains to prove his clients two dozen florida strip malls were damaged by 2005s hurricane wilma  and not because they were old</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont envy new yorkers lieberman said</s>
<s>they should expect a difficult and exhausting process</s>
