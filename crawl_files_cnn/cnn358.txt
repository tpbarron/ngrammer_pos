<s>there are three major sources of merit grants and scholarships</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>states many states including florida georgia tennessee and new mexico award grants or scholarships to students with good grades</s>
<s>your colleges financial aid office should be able to tell you if you qualify for any state merit aid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>colleges the typical college has hundreds sometimes thousands of different merit grants</s>
<s>call your colleges financial aid office to ask about the options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but dont stop there</s>
<s>many merit scholarships are specific to a department sport or activity</s>
<s>so it also pays to call the department that runs your area of study and faculty advisors for any activity such as band or a sport as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>foundations charities and community organizations from your local lions club to foundations funded by big corporations such as cocacola private organizations provide millions of dollars worth of scholarships each year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however many of the biggest private scholarships such as the $20000 cocacola scholars awards have such intense competition that the odds of winning are low</s>
<s>youll have better odds with local competitions</s>
<s>you can find those by asking your high school counselor as well as any organizations that you might have ties to such as a church or civic group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>several web sites offer free searches of scholarship databases but be careful many of them subject you to annoying and sometimes misleading ads</s>
