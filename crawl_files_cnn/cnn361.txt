<s>money magazine  jeanine cotters twohour commute from her san francisco home to her job as inhouse counsel at software maker intuit gave her plenty of time to think  mostly about how much she disliked commuting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was nonproductive time says cotter age 46 who began making the drive in 2000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those lost hours combined with the demands of her work made it difficult for her to meet her familys needs</s>
<s>it was hard to find balance recalls the mom of three</s>

<p>
<s>having seen entrepreneurs in action  small business was the core of intuits customer base  cotter admired their flexibility and she began itching to start her own company</s>
<s>around 2004 conversations with her parents and husband all of whom had experience in renewable energy got her thinking about solar contracting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just looking at the rising cost of energy and the concern over global warming i saw an opportunity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so with the backing of her husband noel who worked in construction cotter incorporated luminalt a company to design and install solar systems</s>
<s>meanwhile noel got licensed in solar contracting and connected with a firm that began outsourcing jobs to luminalt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by 2006 luminalt was making consistent revenue and jeanine gave up her $138000 paycheck to run the growing business fulltime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two years later san francisco launched a solar incentive program</s>
<s>that plus a federal tax credit pushed luminalts sales from $678000 in 2007 to $18 million in 2008</s>
<s>cotter took her first salary  $78000  that year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shes kept her pay and that of her husband who is chief technical officer at the same level</s>
<s>with incentives shrinking her focus now is on building longterm value  by expanding the firms geographic range product offerings and job scope</s>

<s>it was losing money at the time she says</s>
<s>meanwhile we had a company that was growing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>months cotter worked double duty 18</s>

<p>
<s>with one of her kids soon to start college cotter didnt feel ready to give up her intuit salary until luminalt was pulling revenue</s>
<s>she decided to make the leap once the company had annual sales of about $100000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>her familys stake in the business 67</s>
