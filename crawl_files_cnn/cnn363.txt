<s>new york money  ive beefed up my emergency fund to $30000 over the last several years and currently keep it in a moneymarket fund earning 007</s>
<s>should i move it to a highinterest savings account with an online bank that averages around 115</s>
<s>i dont want to turn into a yield chaser</s>
<s> eric olney maryland</s>

<p>
<s>with shortterm interest rates barely in positive territory a lot of people are turning into yield chasers these days</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but is that so bad</s>
<s>id say it depends on how you go about it</s>
<s>or to put it another way you can be a good yield chaser or a bad yield chaser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats the difference</s>
<s>i dont see a problem if by chasing yield you mean going to a site like bankratecom mintcom or billshrink to find a savings account shortterm cd or some other vehicle that offers true security of principal with aboveaverage rates</s>
<s>youre just being a good yield chaser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if the online bank youre dealing with is an fdicinsured institution which you can tell by clicking here and your account qualifies for fdic insurance to determine that click here and you dont have to put up with a lot of hassles to get that attractive rate like meeting a stiff minimum deposit requirement or performing a certain number of transactions or tying up your money too long etc</s>
<s> go for it man</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after all on thirty grand the annual difference between earning 115 and 007 is $324</s>
<s>not a fortune</s>
<s>but even if checking out the online bank opening the account and moving the money takes several hours youre still earning a pretty good effective hourly rate for your time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youll want to keep your eye on that interest rate spread though to make sure it stays in your favor</s>
<s>once rates start to rise it could narrow or even disappear</s>
<s>poll how much have your food bills gone up this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>similarly if you start to venture out further in cd maturities to snag higher yields youll want to be careful about locking in a rate that may be lofty today but could seem puny if rates start to climb later although even then its possible that you could still be better off by bailing out of the cd if the extra yield is high enough and the early withdrawal penalty isnt too punitive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but then theres bad yield chasing that can get you in trouble</s>
<s>here im talking about people who are so eager to get more than 007 that they take on significantly more risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some yield chasers do this on their own others on the advice of people who have an interest in selling the higheryielding investments</s>
<s>these are the people who in the past have gotten burned in auction rate securities foreign cds and even shortterm bond funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>id also put into this group people who have gravitated to annuities that offer enticing payouts but have strings attached such as onerous surrender charges that can range as high as 20 or other potential downsides</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investments that are attracting yield seekers attention today are bank loan or floatingrate funds which according to morningstar stats have been attracting moulah at a faster pace than any other fund category</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>besides their loftier yields the attraction of these funds is that their variable rates will protect their net asset values should interest rates rise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the rub though is that these funds can still carry considerable credit risk  or the risk that companies may have trouble repaying their debt  especially since many of these funds own loans of highly leveraged companies with low credit ratings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and indeed concerns about companies ability to repay what they borrowed so hammered the market value of such loans during the financial crisis that the bank loan category suffered a loss of 30 in 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a new generation of funds and etfs is emerging that focus on shortterm variablerate bonds with higher quality or investment grade ratings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that difference should certainly mitigate though not eliminate credit risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but while i think one can make a case for including bank loan andor variable rate investmentgrade bond funds within a diversified bond portfolio these alternatives are still a rung or two up the risk ladder from fdicinsured accounts and money market funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so id caution against using them for your emergency stash or for that matter for any money that you absolutely positively need to have available at full value even if the markets and the economy go south</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to sum up i wouldnt worry about yield chasing as long as youre not compromising the security of your money and your access to it</s>
<s>but you want to be careful about pursuing extra yield if it means putting your must have money in jeopardy</s>
