<s>new york cnnmoney  american households face an average tax increase of $3500 if congress doesnt act to avert the fiscal cliff according to a new analysis from the tax policy center</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>overall 88 of households would end up with higher taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because a record number of tax increases  due mostly to the expiration of temporary provisions put in place since 2001  are set to take effect starting in january</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all told the center estimates that the fiscal cliff tax provisions would raise an additional $536 billion in revenue next year or 21 of what the federal government would otherwise collect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the range of average tax increases is enormous depending on ones income level</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the top 1 of households which have incomes above $506210 would face an increase of $121000</s>
<s>within that group the top 01  those making more than $266 million  would get hit with a tax hike of nearly $634000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related fiscal cliff whats really in it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contrast households making up to $20113 would see a $412 average increase</s>
<s>that may simply represent a smaller refund to those households many of which have very little if any federal income tax liability to begin with</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>households in the middle  with total incomes between $39790 and $64484  can expect a roughly $2000 increase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>households with low incomes would be particularly affected by the expiration of tax credits expanded or created by the 2009 stimulus the tax policy center wrote on monday</s>
<s>and households with high incomes would be hit hard by the expiration of the 20012003 tax cuts that apply at upper income levels and the start of the new health reform taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 2010 health reform law will impose additional medicare taxes on the wages and investment income of those making more than $200000 $250000 if married filing jointly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the biggest part of the tax hit for middleincome americans would come from the expiration of the bush tax cuts and the payroll tax cut</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>few think however that congress will let all the scheduled tax increases take effect</s>
<s>the current betting says lawmakers will let the temporary payroll tax cut expire but leave the majority of the bush tax cuts in place and reinstate another socalled fix to the alternative minimum tax so that it doesnt ensnare more than 20 million households this year and next</s>
<s>political observers also expect the new health reform taxes will take effect as scheduled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but at the moment no one can say with any certainty what kind of fiscal cliff deal lawmakers will negotiate</s>
<s>and anything they do resolve wont happen until after the election</s>
