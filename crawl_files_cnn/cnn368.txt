<s>new york cnnmoney  there are only so many disasters a business owner can prepare for and superstorm sandy wasnt one of them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wednesday marked the first time employees at jerrys cafe in lower manhattan were able to return check out the damage</s>
<s>the floods hadnt reached it and as far as they could tell wind hadnt broken anything</s>
<s>but the restaurant like thousands of other businesses in the area had lost power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to homeowners thats an inconvenience</s>
<s>to restaurant owner frits de knegt it means losing money</s>
<s>lots of money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pitch black basement smelled of stale feta cheese as de knegts restaurant managers armed with flashlights filled 19 garbage bags with rotting food</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile 73yearold de kneght sat in his powerless apartment a mile north in soho and did the math if power comes back by weeks end hell lose $50000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>compared the utter destruction seen along the new jersey coast ruined food sounds minor</s>
<s>but small businesses often run on thin profit margins</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its almost too much for de kneght to bear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related insurance may not pay for sandy shutdowns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he has decided to pay his workers at least partially even though jerrys remains closed</s>
<s>while on the phone hearing about the damage he considers simply closing or selling the place instead</s>
<s>then he pauses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these people have families to feed he said of his 26 workers</s>
<s>a week out of work is devastating to these people</s>
<s>i think about when i was in their shoes when i was a young man working for somebody</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hes reminded of that moment in 1958 when he was cut from a new york restaurants waiting staff</s>
<s>it was the last time he worked for someone else</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i still remember that feeling of abandonment fear he recalled</s>
<s>i said to myself if im ever in that position i will not do this</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also on chambers street just a few steps away from jerrys cafe quiznos franchise owner erfan mia has similar struggles</s>
<s>his last delivery came in the day before the storm and when the power went off he lost it all</s>
<s>mia sat in the shadows inside his tiny restaurant as workers cleaned out smeared containers behind the counter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mias loss wont stop at the $10000 of rotting meats cheeses and ingredients</s>
<s>power is expected to come back on saturday but mia will have to wait until then to order a new shipment from vendors</s>
<s>the problem is so will everyone else</s>
<s>and even when the food does eventually arrive itll be a few more days before regular customers realize hes open again</s>
<s>the end tab might be closer to $25000 he guessed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well have to go into debt mia said</s>
<s>we cannot even keep up with the rent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mia and other small business owners perched along chambers street dont expect insurance to be much help either</s>
<s>they all bought runofthemill business insurance but none of them invested in a plan that covers hurricanes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and a bitter surprise awaits those who bought yet another layer of protection for unexpected shutdowns business interruption insurance</s>
<s>it probably wont apply because policies only kick in if a business property is physically damaged</s>
<s>no money is offered to those who cant serve customers without power</s>
<s>the same applies to businesses along new yorks 57th street where a massive crane dangles precariously above a road that remains closed off to workers and customers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you claim $15000 theyll maybe give you $5000 mia said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in six months chimed in alam khan owner of a nearby tasti dlite ice cream shop</s>
