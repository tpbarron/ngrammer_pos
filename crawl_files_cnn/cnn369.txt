<s>new york cnnmoney  can i purchase an apartment building as an investment with the money i have in my ira</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>the short answer is yes provided you open a selfdirected ira with a custodian willing to deal with alternative assets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with erratic stock returns in recent years and stingy bond yields many retirement investors are turning not just to real estate but to nontraditional investments from gold bullion and hedge funds to tax liens and horses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but just because the government lets you stuff your ira with almost anything  the few nonos include life insurance and art  doesnt mean you should</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before pinning your retirement on any outoftheordinary investment proceed with extreme caution</s>
<s>for starters you could get conned</s>
<s>last fall securities regulators issued a warning about flimflam artists pitching owners of selfdirected iras everything from fake commercial mortgage loans to foreign bonds that were part of a ponzi scheme</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason scamsters target iras is that theyre a veritable honeypot</s>
<s>a recent mckinsey report estimates that between 2009 and 2015 savers will roll some $15 trillion from 401ks and similar accounts into iras</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regulators note that since iras are designed as longterm investment vehicles owners may not be vigilant in monitoring their accounts allowing years to pass before a worthless investment is spotted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you should also keep in mind that unusual investments also carry unusual risks</s>
<s>gene valentini 67 who runs a county agency in texas invested $50000 in racehorses eight years ago through a selfdirected ira expecting returns of 25 or more a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so how did his ponies run</s>
<s>almost every horse died or retired he says</s>
<s>i get a sporadic dollar here or there but the money is gone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investing in a single property may seem more straightforward but it leaves you vulnerable to the prospects for just one neighborhood</s>
<s>you can mitigate that risk by owning several buildings</s>
<s>but unless youve got a much bigger nest egg than most  the average ira is worth less than $125000  it would be difficult to own even a few buildings without your portfolio becoming dangerously overweighted in real estate which generally should account for no more than 15 to 20 of your investment holdings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally a variety of irs rules can trip you up</s>
<s>you can buy a vacation home with your selfdirected ira for example but you then cant stay there or even rent it to close family members</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you need to do a repair or renovation you cant just fork over money from your own pocket to cover it</s>
<s>the funds must come from within the ira itself</s>
<s>if your ira doesnt have enough cash you can replenish it</s>
<s>but you cant contribute more than the annual contribution limit $5000 this year plus $1000 if youre 50 or older</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anything beyond that is considered an excess contribution</s>
<s>run afoul of such regs and the irs can levy harsh penalties and in some cases effectively disqualify your ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line if youre set on owning real estate in your ira you can get much of the same benefit without the hassle by simply buying a mutual fund that invests in reits or other real estate  and even then youve got to be careful</s>
