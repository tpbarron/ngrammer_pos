<s>step one is to figure out what type of loan you have says marsha ohare a financial service specialist and hudcertified housing counselor at apprisen a columbus ohiobased credit counseling organization</s>
<s>if the loan is owned or guaranteed by freddie mac or fannie mae you may be eligible for the governments home affordable refinancing program harp</s>
<s>it allows someone who is not delinquent in their payments to refinance even if the house is worth less than the loan says ohare</s>
<s>you can find more information about harp at httpwwwmakinghomeaffordablegov</s>

<p>
<s>another option she says is a federal housing administration fha short refinance</s>
<s>this program is extended to homeowners who are not behind on payments owe more than their home is worth and whose loans are not covered by fannie mae freddie mac or fha</s>
<s>a key part of the program is that lenders must agree to reduce the principal of the loan so contact your mortgage provider to see if you are eligible</s>

<p>
<s>if these options dont work ohare suggests meeting with a certified housing counselor to work through the specifics of the loan and figure out what might work best for your financial situation</s>
