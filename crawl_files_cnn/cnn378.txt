<s>new york cnnmoney  mitt romneys videotaped remarks made public this week point to at least one true fact nearly half of american taxpayers do indeed end up paying no federal income tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in footage taped with a hidden camera at a romney fundraiser in may the republican presidential candidate describes the 47 of the people who will vote for president obama no matter what</s>
<s> he says they are dependent on government and believe they are victims</s>
<s> they pay no income tax he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact the main reason so many americans end up with no federal income tax liability is congress addiction to tax breaks  tax breaks both democrats and republicans have supported</s>
<s>related obama v romney on taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>intentionally or not congress set it up this way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the years lawmakers have increased the number of nonpayers by enacting reams of tax breaks  such as tax credits for work kids and education</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bush tax cuts first passed more than a decade ago expanded many of them</s>
<s>indeed if the bush tax cuts are allowed to expire the number of nonpayers could drop significantly according to roberton williams a senior fellow at the tax policy center</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related billionaires with 1 tax rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lawmakers also approved a number of temporary tax breaks after the 2008 financial crisis to stimulate the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tax policy center has estimated that in tax year 2011 46 of households owed nothing in federal income taxes</s>
<s>about half are nontaxable strictly because of tax breaks</s>
<s>the other half didnt owe federal income tax because of exemptions allowed for subsistence level income and dependents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the no tax club includes some of the very rich  a few thousand a year usually</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the group of nonpayers is made up disproportionately of low and lowermiddleincome households including seniors</s>
<s>more than 90 of all the those who had no federal income tax liability in 2011 had income below $50000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and if payroll taxes are counted the number of nonpayer households drops precipitously  to an estimated 18 in 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why</s>
<s>because payroll taxes which fund the big entitlement programs hit lowincome households harder than most since 100 of their income is subject to them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contrast highincome filers pay a lower percentage of their income in payroll taxes since wages subject to the social security tax are capped at $110100</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course thats all just about federal taxes paid on income</s>
<s>once sales taxes as well as state and local income taxes are thrown into the mix virtually no household in america would qualify for the nonpayer group</s>
