<s>new york cnnmoney  many people think they can plan on spending less later in retirement since theyll become less active as they age</s>
<s>but if their health declines they may actually shift spending rather than reduce it</s>
<s>do you think its risky to plan as if ones expenses will go down later in retirement</s>

<p>
<s>yes i do think its risky but i understand why people mistakenly think its safe</s>
</p>

<s>in the 1990s financial planner michael stein wrote the prosperous retirement in which he laid out three stages of postcareer life the gogo or earliest stage when people are most vigorous and eager to make the most of their newfound freedom from the daily grind the slowgo phase when people remain active but not quite as much as during their initial retirement years and the nogo phase when old age kicks in and people retreat to a more sedentary life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many people assume that their spending will drop in that final stage  one financial planner has estimated that retirees over 75 spend about 25 less than those aged 65 to 74  but stein himself says that the nogo phase is actually the most uncertain as far spending goes</s>
<s>much of that uncertainty surrounds your health</s>
<s>if youre lucky enough to have no major medical issues and remain relatively fit throughout retirement your overall spending may drop once you shift to a stayathome lifestyle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you end up requiring expensive medical care or need assistance because youre physically unable to care for yourself your outlays could rise dramatically depending on how much of your care is covered by programs like medicare or insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but medical costs arent the only potential surprise factor</s>
<s>regardless of whether your expenses go up or down you could end up living longer than you expect and have to fund more years in retirement than you anticipated</s>
<s>a 2006 society of actuaries report found that only 29 of retirees and 30 of preretirees thought they would live longer than the average life expectancy</s>
<s>in reality closer to 50 will outlive the average</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the upshot during your career and maybe even well into retirement its extremely difficult to tell how much youll spend in retirement and whether your spending will rise drop or remain relatively constant throughout retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given that i think it would be unwise to count on your living costs going down late in retirement</s>
<s>if you rely on spending less and youre wrong you might have to make unpleasant cutbacks in your final years in order to avoid running out of dough</s>
<s>that could make for an anxious and grim retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when youre still many years from retiring the most important thing is to make sure youre saving enough for a long retirement</s>
<s>and in estimating the appropriate level of savings its prudent to assume that youll want to maintain your purchasing power throughout retirement  and that youll live several years beyond life expectancy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a tool like t rowe prices retirement income calculator can help you arrive at an appropriate savings rate based on how much youve already got socked away the age at which you plan to retire and how you invest your savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the calculator assumes inflation will run at 3 a year and assumes your spending will increase at that rate</s>
<s>if you think that assumption is too low or too high you can always save more or less</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as you get within five to 10 years of calling it a career you should have a better sense of how much youll probably spend in retirement</s>
<s>to get an even clearer picture do some lifestyle planning  thinking seriously about how youll live once you stop working full time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>will you start traveling to visit farflung relatives and friends</s>
<s>relocate to an area that offers lower costs or a more pleasant lifestyle or both</s>
<s>pursue a hobby or avocation youve always been interested in</s>
<s>do volunteer work</s>
<s>maybe start a parttime business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>put dollars and cents to these plans</s>
<s>before you retire make a budget to have a realistic sense of how much youll need to live and how long your savings are likely to last</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the interactive budgeting tool within fidelitys retirement income planner allows you to divvy up your spending among more than four dozen separate categories</s>
<s>you can earmark categories that are essential to give you an idea of how much wiggle room you have should you need to pare your spending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally periodically revisit and update your budget as your spending will likely deviate from projections at least in some categories</s>
<s>plug this new spending information into the fidelity or t rowe price tool to estimate your chances of outliving your money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>based on this assessment decide whether it makes sense to adjust your spending levels</s>
<s>or you can just plan as if your spending will drop as you slow down later in retirement</s>
<s>and hope that if it does its because you dont want to spend more not because you cant afford to</s>
