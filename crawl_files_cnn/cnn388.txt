<s>finding the right balance between investing and saving will reap retirement rewards</s>

<s>money magazine  how much better will you do if you invest well instead of poorly or earn the average</s>
<s> james mcgrath san marcos calif</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>considering all the attention investment pros and financial magazines lavish on picking the right stocks and funds i can understand why you might think superior investing ranks above all else when it comes to a secure future and a comfortable retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>savvy investing is certainly important  you dont want to blow your savings on lousy funds or ineffectual strategies</s>
<s>and youll end up richer if you happen upon a winning investment</s>
<s>if youd owned the sequoia fund for the past decade for example a $10000 balance would have grown to more than $16000 now vs $12800 if youd simply earned the market return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but as a practical matter you cant know in advance which fund or stock will beat the market  in fact over the past 15 years only 55 of us equity funds did so according to morningstar</s>
<s>rather than pinning your hopes on higher returns id say boosting your savings rate is a surer way to improve your retirement prospects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to see what i mean check out this example</s>
<s>lets say youre 35 years old earn $60000 a year and sock away 10 of your salary including your company match into a 401k thats already worth $75000</s>
<s>and assume youre stashing your retirement moolah in a diversified portfolio of 60 stocks and 40 bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youre doing a reasonable though not spectacular job of preparing for retirement</s>
<s>your savings rate is decent though it could be better</s>
<s>as for investing youre hardly a slouch but ideally you should be devoting more of your 401k to stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the key is starting with an overall plan  that is deciding on the appropriate asset allocation or blend of stock and bond funds that makes sense given your age and stomach for risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed when the folks at t rowe price ran the numbers on this saving and investing regimen they projected that youd have a 68 chance of accumulating enough money to retire in 30 years on 70 of your preretirement income and not deplete your funds until age 92</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not bad</s>
<s>but if you could do just one thing to improve your outlook what would it be</s>
<s>save more or earn more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you cant of course say youd prefer an 8 annual return instead of 6 and turn a dial higher to get it</s>
<s>the investing world doesnt work that way</s>
<s>so to try to earn more you have to invest more aggressively</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in this example both increasing your savings rate from 10 to 12 and shifting to a more growthoriented portfolio thats 80 stocks and 20 bonds an appropriate mix for a 35yearold  will boost your chances of retirement success</s>
<s>but saving more has a larger effect than earning a higher return would</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the real world youre not limited to one move</s>
<s>you can bump up the amount you save and improve a sub par investing strategy</s>
<s>do both those things  which ideally you would  and you can feel even more confident about achieving a secure retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in theory later in your career when youre more likely to have a large balance in your retirement accounts a relatively modest increase in your rate of return could boost the size of your nest egg more than upping your savings rate would</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on a $500000 portfolio for example an additional half percentage point of return would translate to an extra $2500 a year more than someone earning $100000 would get by moving from a 10 to a 12 savings rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>trouble is the more risk you take in pursuit of loftier gains the more your returns will jump up and down from year to year and the harder your portfolio will get hammered during market setbacks</s>
<s>take a 55yearold a decade from retirement  for that person a pedaltothemetal approach is no help</s>
<s>because you have less time to recover from a setback it slightly cuts your chances of reaching your goals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said you still have one way to effectively earn more on your portfolio without ratcheting up risk pare investment fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>annual expenses for stock funds average 15 while the yearly tab for bond funds comes in at roughly 1</s>
<s>by opting for lowcost options like index funds and exchangetraded funds which often charge less than 05 annually you may be able to reduce your costs by anywhere from a half to a full percentage point a year</s>
<s>over the course of a career that can boost the eventual size of your nest egg a good 10 to 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally theres one more compelling reason not to rely on astute investing</s>
<s>given the sluggish growth and onerous levels of government debt here and abroad even the most savvy investors may have to settle for relatively modest returns</s>
<s>that could be a major problem if your retirement security hinges on racking up big gains</s>
<s>boosting your savings rate is a surer way to increase the ultimate size of your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so by all means make sure youre investing as well as you can</s>
<s>if you really want to improve your prospects though save moreÂ </s>
