<s>money magazine  are moneymarket accounts and moneymarket funds the same thing</s>
<s> ed middleburg heights ohio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not by a long shot</s>
<s>even though the names are similar and many investors think of them as interchangeable stashes for ready cash and emergency funds moneymarket accounts and moneymarket funds are very different</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while it might have once been ok to gloss over their differences in todays postfinancial crisis world you need to understand the distinctions between the two as well as the different levels of security they provide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a moneymarket account is essentially a savings account with checkwriting privileges thats offered by a bank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>each bank sets the interest rate that its moneymarket account pays  about 05 on average lately  and that rate is usually higher than the yield on regular savings accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as long as the bank is a member of the federal deposit insurance system its moneymarket accounts are fdicinsured which means youre generally covered up to a limit of $250000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a moneymarket fund on the other hand is a mutual fund</s>
<s>it is not a bank account and doesnt qualify for fdic insurance even if you happen to get into a moneymarket fund through your bank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moneymarket funds can invest in the shortterm debt of the us government and its agencies as well as in the shortterm obligations of domestic and foreign corporations and banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yield on those investments determines how much moneymarket funds pay</s>
<s>because shortterm interest rates have been scraping along the floor of late moneymarket funds these days yield a measly 003 or so on average</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moneymarket funds are designed to maintain a stable price of $1 per share with each dollar of interest you collect earning you an additional share of the fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but theres no guarantee that a moneyfunds share value wont sink below $1</s>
<s>and in fact after decades of a nearly flawless record of money funds preserving a $1 per share value in september 2008 the reserve primary fund broke the buck or let its share price slip below $1 after suffering losses on lehman brothers debt it owned</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that loss combined with other problems in the credit markets as the financial crisis unfolded resulted in a number of investment firms having to shore up their money funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to prevent a run on money funds the treasury department also created a special program to guarantee the value of money fund assets</s>
<s>that program ended in september 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since then the securities and exchange commission has required money funds to tighten their investing standards to reduce the chance of them breaking the buck again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the sec and the money fund industry have also been trying to hammer out a number of other reforms</s>
<s>they could include such provisions as allowing money funds share price to go up and down like any other mutual funds share price requiring money funds to hold more capital or having money funds hold back a portion say 3 of investor redemptions for 30 days</s>
<s>at this point its unclear which reforms might eventually be put into place and when</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so what does all this mean for individuals like you who are deciding where to put the cash they want to keep safe for everyday living expenses or as an emergency reserve</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well if you want the highest level of yield and safety moneymarket accounts are the clear choice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>granted unless youre investing pretty large amounts their extra payouts may not amount to a whole lot</s>
<s>the difference between earning 05 and 003 on $10000 is just $47 a year or less than $4 a month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even if the yield advantage doesnt create a windfall youre also getting an investment thats more secure than a money market fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not to say money funds are unsafe</s>
<s>i think the risk of loss in them is still very low</s>
<s>but the financial crisis has shown that money funds can run into problems during extreme times</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that doesnt mean you should necessarily dump money funds if you own them</s>
<s>i still own money funds mostly for the convenience of having my ready cash with the same firm that holds my other investments</s>
<s>but im aware that im paying for this convenience in the form of lower yields and a somewhat elevated although in my view still small level of risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this could all change in the future</s>
<s>the sec may enact rules that will make money funds less vulnerable during periods of upheaval while still affording investors easy access to their dough</s>
<s>or when interest rates start to rise perhaps money funds will start paying higher rates than moneymarket accounts as was often the case before the financial crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for now though convenience aside moneymarket accounts are the better place to be</s>
