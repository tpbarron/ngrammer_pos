<s>after months of criticism for not detailing how he would pay for his tax cuts romney starts to lay out options for capping tax deductions and limiting breaks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  with just a month to go before election day mitt romney has finally started to talk about more specific ways he could pay for his proposed tax cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in an interview with a denver tv station earlier this week romney offered what a campaign spokeswoman called an illustrative example for how to help pay for his plan which would slash income tax rates by 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney said limits could be put on how much a tax filer claims in itemized deductions</s>
<s>as an option you could say everybodys going to get up to a $17000 deduction</s>
<s> and higher income people might have a lower number</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>capping itemized deductions alone would not be nearly enough to pay for romneys tax plan which the tax policy center estimates could reduce revenue by roughly $500 billion a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example in 2009 the amount of tax savings realized by those who claimed itemized deductions was just $147 billion</s>
<s>imposing a $17000 cap would recapture only a portion of that money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but a policy official with the romney campaign told cnnmoney on wednesday that a deduction cap would be just one part of a broader strategy to pay for romneys tax cuts</s>
<s>other elements would include limits on personal exemptions and the taxfree benefit workers get when employers pay for their health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and the official said the $17000 is not a fixed number</s>
<s>it could change depending on where congress and the president set the level for personal exemptions and the socalled health care exclusion</s>
<s>related the candidates and your taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the romney campaign is also counting on economic growth to generate revenue to help pay for the tax cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>without more detail its impossible to say how much revenue such a strategy would raise and the romney campaign didnt offer estimates</s>
<s>nor is it possible to say which income groups would be most affected by such a payfor strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the interview earlier this week romney also highlighted other ways his plan could be paid for that he has discussed in the past</s>
<s>but the deduction cap was a first</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and it came after months of criticism for not naming one tax break he would be willing to limit to help pay for his plan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related how candidates would handle fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>each tax break in federal law has its fierce defenders and army of lobbyists</s>
<s>so it may be politically smarter to bypass the mud fights in congress over whether to limit say the mortgage interest deduction or tax break on charitable contributions</s>
<s>instead tax filers could pick their deductions so long as they dont exceed a cap</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney isnt the first to propose such an idea</s>
<s>its been kicked around in various forms by tax experts including harvard economist martin feldstein who is an adviser to the romney campaign</s>
