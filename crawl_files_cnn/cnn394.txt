<s>new york cnnmoney  credit rating agency standard  poors on friday downgraded the credit rating of the united states stripping the worlds largest economy of its prized aaa status</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in july sp placed the united states rating on creditwatch with negative implications as the debt ceiling debate devolved into partisan bickering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to avoid a downgrade sp said the united states needed to not only raise the debt ceiling but also develop a credible plan to tackle the nations longterm debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in its report friday sp ruled that the us fell short the downgrade reflects our opinion that the  plan that congress and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what in our view would be necessary to stabilize the governments mediumterm debt dynamics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sp also cited dysfunctional policymaking in washington as a factor in the downgrade</s>
<s>the political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as americas governance and policymaking becoming less stable less effective and less predictable than what we previously believed</s>
<s> faq behind the downgrade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a treasury department spokesman pushed back on the rating change saying that sps analysis was flawed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a source familiar with the matter said sp initially miscalculated the growth trajectory of the nations debt and then went ahead with its downgrade anyway</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the source also said sp didnt give enough credit for the debtceiling compromise which paved the way for more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however one of sps explicit criticisms of the compromise was that it didnt address the biggest drivers of the nations debt  social security and medicare  and didnt allow for additional tax revenue</s>
<s>whats wrong with the debt ceiling deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>john chambers head of sovereign ratings for sp told cnn that though sp didnt have a specific target in mind the total debt reduction package was not sufficient</s>
<s>chambers also noted that the plan did not take steps in the near term to boost economic growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rating agencies  sp moodys and fitch  analyze risk and give debt a grade that reflects the borrowers ability to pay the underlying loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the safest bets are stamped aaa</s>
<s>thats where us debt has stood for years</s>
<s>moodys first assigned the united states a aaa rating in 1917</s>
<s>the countrys new sp rating is aa  still strong but not the highest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the downgrade puts the us debt rating on par with that of belgium but below countries like the united kingdom and australia</s>
<s>see whos in the triplea club</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the days after lawmakers managed to strike a debtceiling deal the two other major rating agencies have both said the deficit reduction actions taken by congress were a step in the right direction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on tuesday moodys said the united states will keep its sterling aaa credit rating but lowered its outlook on us debt to negative</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even after a downgrade the united states will likely still be able to pay its bills for years to come and remains a good credit risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a downgrade really just amounts to one agencys opinion</s>
<s>federal reserve chairman ben bernanke articulated that view in april when sp placed the united states on credit watch</s>
<s>sps action didnt really tell us anything bernanke said</s>
<s>everybody who reads the newspaper knows that the united states has a very serious longterm fiscal problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors have limited options for making safe investments and treasuries are effectively as liquid as cash</s>
<s>and other big countries have been downgraded and were still able to borrow at low rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time some experts warn that a downgrade could gum up the banking system and ripple out onto main street</s>
<s>treasuries are used as collateral in many transactions between financial institutions and grease the skids of lending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shortly after the downgrade the federal reserve fdic and other bank regulators moved to blunt the affect of the action on the banking system</s>
<s>in a joint release the agencies said they would continue to treat treasuries and other securities issued by governmentsponsored entities such as fannie mae and freddie mac the same as before they were downgraded</s>
<s>treasuries are often used as collateral for shortterm lending among banks and other financial institutions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consumers and investors could feel the impact of a downgrade</s>
<s>interest rates on bonds could rise and rates on mortgages and other types of loans along with them</s>
<s>your stocks your cash will you feel the downgrade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>governmentbacked agencies like fannie mae and freddie mac may also be downgraded</s>
<s>its also possible that some state and local governments could also face a downgrade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and investment decisions would become complicated for large institutional investors that are required to hold highlyrated securitiesÂ </s>
