<s>money magazine  had julie ganong and alan mons not both been laid off in 2008 the couple might not be making whoopie right now</s>
<s>whoopie pies that is</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>almost immediately after being let go from the provident bank where she was a senior vice president ganong began searching for similar positions</s>
<s>but her husband a business analyst at sun life financial was not unhappy to get the ax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a restaurant manager and line cook in a former life mons had been wanting to shift back to a foodrelated career</s>
<s>and his wife had given him an idea to perfect a miniversion of the whoopie pie a maine tradition shed baked beside her grandmother that consists of two dense cookies sandwiching a fluffy filling</s>
<s>losing my job gave me the time to make this dream real he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ganong started helping him out between job interviews</s>
<s>in may 2009 she assembled a focus group for a taste test</s>
<s>the feedback was positive</s>
<s>so that same month when a friend informed them that a bakery in newburyport mass was up for lease the couple sprang into action</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they tapped a heloc for $15000 for equipment  and opened chococoa baking co within three weeks</s>
<s>ganong soon stopped sending out her résumé</s>
<s>it became clear this business needed both of us she says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their bakery launched just as whoopies began gaining traction across the us elbowing in on the cupcake trend</s>
<s>excitement surrounding the treat has helped ganong and mons establish sales of around 4000 pies a week</s>
<s>at that pace and a price of $168 apiece chococoa should break even this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the couple who once earned $160000 took home just 10 of that in 2011</s>
<s>but a distribution deal in the works with a regional grocery could easily double their output  at which point wed be in a position to really pay ourselves says ganong</s>
<s>then theyll be living their sweet dream</s>
