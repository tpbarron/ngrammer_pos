<s>president obama has pushed to raise tax rates on the rich and house speaker john boehner has pushed to keep them low</s>
<s>if the fiscal cliff is to be averted they may need to compromise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  it wont happen without a fight  potentially a really ugly fight</s>
<s>and it may even push the country over the fiscal cliff for a time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but now that president obama has been reelected and democrats have retained control of the senate theres a far greater chance that highincome households will soon face higher tax bills</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it seems likely said republican tax lobbyist ken kies of the federal policy group</s>
<s>i cant imagine president obama will agree to extend the bush tax cuts for everyone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed senior administration officials have said that the president would veto any package that extends them for highincome taxpayers</s>
<s>related california oks tax hikes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but that doesnt mean house republicans will back down on their insistence that no ones tax rates go up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on wednesday house speaker john boehner held fast to the republican line</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we wont solve the problem of our fiscal imbalance overnight he said</s>
<s>and we certainly wont solve it by simply raising tax rates or taking a plunge off the fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama staked his reelection campaign and his first term on the issue of asking the rich to pay their fair share</s>
<s> and he has repeatedly called for the expiration of the portion of the bush tax cuts that apply to households making more than $2000000 $250000 if married</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there may be more than one way to thread the needle on taxing the rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for instance said sean west the us policy director of the eurasia group a potential compromise threshold for rich could be $1 million instead of $250000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or lawmakers could agree to cap the value of some tax breaks on the rich</s>
<s>that may help clear a path to a shortterm deal to avert the fiscal cliff and buy lawmakers time to work out a more comprehensive debtreduction package that includes tax reform</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while higher taxes on the rich may be likely the question is how much more and what form it takes said douglas holtzeakin president of the american action forum a gop think tank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words a tax hike could come via higher tax rates anathema to republicans or through basebroadening which would limit tax breaks available to highincome households</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since obama overwhelmingly won the electoral vote but only narrowly captured the popular vote over mitt romney the president and boehner could engage in a standoff of mandates holtzeakin said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and what will be needed is principled compromise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one way to move in that direction he said is if the president sends a fullfledged bill to the hill laying out his debtreduction proposals in detail</s>
<s>that could help start the process</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the hill needs air cover to say we dont want to do this but the president asked us holtzeakin said</s>
<s>and once lawmakers put in their own modifications those who need cover can say they fixed it</s>
