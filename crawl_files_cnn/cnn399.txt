<s>new york money magazine  im 52 and have had 100 of my savings in stocks since i began investing at age 25</s>
<s>given my high risk tolerance and the fact that i expect that my pension and social security to cover a substantial portion of my expenses in retirement why should i reduce my investment returns by investing in bonds</s>

<s>if youve been putting your dough exclusively in stocks for the past 27 years then you know firsthand how lucrative they can be over the long term</s>
<s>since 1985 the year you began investing stocks have gained an annualized 11</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you no doubt also know how risky stocks can be over shorter periods</s>
<s>youve lived through the crash of 1987 when the dow jones industrial average plummeted 508 points  nearly 23  in a single day</s>
<s>and youve survived both the bear market of 20002002 which saw stock prices fall 49 and the meltdown of 20072009 when stock values dropped almost 57 a setback from which they still havent fully recovered</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im sure i also dont have to tell you that bonds returned far less than stocks over the past 27 years and that their yields are especially low right now with 10year treasury bonds yielding less than 2 and investment grade corporates paying only a half percentage point or so more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given your experience with stocks and the state of the bond market these days i can understand why you equate keeping any of your savings in bonds as nothing more than an invitation to subpar returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but i think you need to revise your thinking</s>
<s>heres why</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you became an investor near the beginning of one of the greatest bull markets in history</s>
<s>the surge in stock prices that began in 1982 and with few interruptions continued through the end of 1999 showered investors with almost unprecedented rewards</s>
<s>it also included some truly phenomenal stretches like the 10year span from 1989 through 1998 when stocks gained a compounded 19 a year almost double equities longterm annualized return since 1926</s>
<s>so i think its fair to say that this outsize performance has a lot to do with the way you feel about stocks</s>

<s>related investing when to take money off the table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more up to now youve viewed the risks and rewards of stock investing primarily through the lens of a relatively young person</s>
<s>which means youve been much more likely to shrug off stocks periodic setbacks</s>
<s>theyre not as scary when you have decades to rebound from them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but looking ahead conditions may be quite different</s>
<s>while stocks are still likely to beat bonds over very long stretches many analysts believe stocks wont deliver anywhere near the same size gains they did in the gogo 80s and 90s nor will they outperform bonds by as large a margin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats certainly been true for the past 10 years with stocks gaining 73 vs 63 for bonds</s>
<s>some investment advisers like pimcos william gross are even forecasting extremely meager stock returns for the years ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while you may still think of yourself as quite the risk taker i think you should allow for at least the possibility that a 50 decline in the value of your savings  and the retirement income it might produce  may be much more upsetting as you get closer to the end of your career than it was when you were starting out</s>
<s>im a bit older than you but ive found im much more sensitive to stocks volatility myself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as you weigh the issue of risk you may also want to factor into your thinking recent research that suggests that the severity of downdrafts weve seen in stocks in the past may occur more frequently than we previously believed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at any rate i recommend that you at least consider scaling back your equity exposure</s>
<s>im not talking about a total retreat</s>
<s>rather im suggesting a stocksbonds mix that allows for longterm growth but wont get hammered as much should the market tank during your home stretch to retirement  say 70 stocks and 30 bonds</s>
<s>as you age you would then gradually reduce your stock stake dialing it back to 50 or so of your holdings by the time you retire and then eventually paring it down to between 20 and 30</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you expect that your pension and social security will cover most of your basic retirement living expenses youll have more leeway in how much youll have to draw from your stock portfolio</s>
<s>that flexibility could allow you to be more aggressive and increase your stock percentage a bit</s>
<s>but id be wary of going higher than say 75 to 80 stocks today and 55 to 60 at retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related am i on track to retire at 67</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many investors are particularly wary of making bonds part of their portfolio these days for fear they could suffer losses if interest rates rise</s>
<s>but the potential setbacks in bonds  especially those with short to intermediateterm maturities  pale in comparison to the hits stocks have taken in the past and could take in the future</s>
<s>so despite any anxiety about interest rates rising bonds are still a worthwhile way to reduce the overall risk level of a portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line im all for maintaining reasonable exposure to stocks in the years leading up to and following retirement</s>
<s>but the key word is reasonable</s>
<s>obviously you have to decide whats appropriate for you</s>
<s>but youll be a lot better off if your decision includes a realistic reassessment of your risk tolerance rather than simply going with what worked over the past 27 years</s>
