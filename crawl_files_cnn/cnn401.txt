<s>money magazine  how can you know if an adviser really has your best interests at heart</s>

<p>
<s>when you need help with your finances you want to find a pro who can balance your need for trustworthy advice with his or her need to make a living providing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the leading school of thought is that your best shot lies with an adviser who is a fiduciary  someone legally required to place your interests first</s>
<s>only registered investment advisers are held to this standard and that typically includes financial planners who charge a fee</s>
<s>brokers and advisers who work for commissions must generally assure only that an investment is suitable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>following the madoff scandal and the financial crisis congress directed the securities and exchange commission to consider applying the fiduciary standard to all advisers</s>
<s>two years later the sec is still mulling the issue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i think its a mistake to assume that an adviser has your back just because he or she is a fiduciary</s>
<s>acting in the best interests of the client has a reassuring ring but in real life it can be tough to tell whose interests are paramount</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example investing a portion of your nest egg in an immediate annuity can lower your chances of running through your savings but ive talked to many advisers who are loath to recommend one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is that because they believe youre better off in a stockbond portfolio</s>
<s>or could they be swayed by the fact that recommending such an annuity slashes the amount you have in stocks and bonds and therefore trims their fees whats called annuicide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anyone you work with has biases</s>
<s>use this vetting process to spot them and then decide whether you still trust the advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first make sure hes clean</s>
<s>go to secgov and choose check out a broker or adviser under education</s>
<s>youll find links to the secs advisory firm database finras brokercheck website plus links to state regulators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>find out what he can sell you</s>
<s>can an adviser suggest any investments or must he pick from a preapproved menu and who wrote it</s>
<s>what does the adviser recommend most often</s>
<s>if the bulk of his business is one investment  an insurance product say  you may be getting a sales pitch not advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ask what youll pay</s>
<s>get a full breakdown of whats going to the adviser whether commissions or a fee 1 a year is common as well as the underlying costs of the investments 05 to 1 a year is typical</s>
<s>are there lowercost alternatives</s>
<s>if so whats stopping him from using them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tackle conflicts head on</s>
<s>ask how your interests might run up against the advisers</s>
<s>if he says he has no conflicts hes not being forthright or not thinking hard enough</s>
<s>a bad sign either way</s>
