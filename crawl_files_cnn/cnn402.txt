<s>cisco ceo john chambers has given shareholders back a big chunk of the companys cash through a hefty dividend</s>
<s>but its not enough to satisfy investors that want stronger earnings growth</s>
</p>

<s>we may find out tuesday</s>
<s>cisco csco reports earnings after the closing bell on tuesday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its been a tough year for the networking giant</s>
<s>shares are down 65 despite the fact that it has nearly $50 billion in caysh on its balance sheet and is putting a lot of it to use with a dividend</s>
<s>ciscos quarterly payout now yields 33</s>
<s>thats more than double the rate of a 10year us treasury note</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shares did gain nearly 1 friday even though the stock was downgraded by analysts at jpmorgan</s>
<s>and to be fair cisco is hardly the only company in its sector that is struggling</s>
<s>shares of smaller networking competitors juniper jnpr f5 networks ffiv and alcatellucent alu have all taken a bigger beating in 2012</s>
<s>but it has to sting cisco longs that the company has fared so poorly while most big tech stocks are having a solid year</s>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>nonetheless its hard to find too many fans of cisco these days</s>
<s>traders on stocktwits seem to think that the companys transition from growth stock to value stock is now fully complete</s>
<s>with shares trading for less than 9 times fiscal 2013 earnings estimates it would appear they are right</s>
<s>and the problem for investors throughout tech is that cisco remains a bellwether</s>
<s>if chambers issues a gloomy forecast for his company that could mean bad news for a lot of companies</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>as dominant as cisco is in its area it cant overcome the fact that there is little growth in the business right now</s>
<s>analysts are only predicting annual sales increases of 6 in fiscal 2013 and 2014  so investors that might find cisco attractive have to keep hoping for more dividend increases</s>
<s>and some worry that could be in jeopardy due to president obamas reelection and the battle over the fiscal cliff</s>

<s>and now for the reader comment of the week</s>
<s>sure there was a lot of chatter about that election thing and the fiscal cliff</s>
<s>but many of my twitter followers seem to be far more interested in the recent train wreck that is apples aapl stock</s>
