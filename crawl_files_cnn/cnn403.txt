<s>new york cnnmoney  the first debate between president obama and mitt romney was a fire hose of fiscal issues that nonetheless left many questions unresolved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney did try to answer one unequivocally he said he will not cut taxes for the rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i will not reduce the share paid by highincome individuals romney said</s>
<s>a few breaths later all right</s>
<s>i will not reduce the taxes paid by highincome americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but how hell keep that promise is still not clear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the issue of how much the rich pay in taxes is a touchy one for romney</s>
<s>he is one of the richest people ever to seek the job of president and his own taxes have been fodder for obama and his proxies for months now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has said he will slash income tax rates for everyone  including the rich  by 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but he has also promised to pay for his tax reform plan which is estimated to reduce revenue by $5 trillion over a decade</s>
<s>one way he says he would do so is by reducing tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related romney signals limits on tax breaks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>earlier this week romney suggested one way to limit the tax breaks is to cap everyones itemized deductions at $17000</s>
<s>while that would certainly reduce the value of deductions for the rich its no guarantee that many still wouldnt get a net tax cut given romneys promise to cut todays tax rates by 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example someone with $1 million in taxable wage income subject to todays top rate of 35 would save $70000 if that rate drops to 28</s>
<s>if that same person also normally takes $100000 in itemized deductions he would lose about $23240 in tax savings if those deductions are capped at $17000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words his net tax cut would be $46760 $70000 minus $23240</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the romney campaign however has also told cnnmoney that if romney were to adopt such a cap on itemized deductions it would be paired with stilltobedetermined limits on personal exemptions and the taxfree benefit workers enjoy when their employer helps pay for their health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>depending where those limits are set they could wipe out the tax savings above</s>
<s>or they may not</s>
<s>its impossible to say without further details</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then in last nights debate romney suggested the deduction cap could be set at $25000 or $50000 instead of $17000</s>
<s>that would change the math too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then theres the issue of semantics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romneys promise to not reduce the share of taxes paid by the rich is not necessarily the same as saying the tax bills of some highincome filers wouldnt go down</s>
<s>it means that what highincome filers as a group contribute as a percentage of total revenue would be the same as it is today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on top of that of course its not clear where romney would draw the line on highincome</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what last nights debate showed is that romney continues to promise that his tax plan will not reduce the taxes paid by the rich  either as a group or as individuals</s>
<s>what it did not clarify was how exactly he plans to ensure that</s>
