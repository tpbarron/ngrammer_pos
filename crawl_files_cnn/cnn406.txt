<s>bob johnson im not the smartest guy on the block but ive had more opportunities than others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fortune  you may know robert l bob johnson best for launching black entertainment television bet back in 1980</s>
<s>but after selling bet to viacom for $3 billion the 66yearold johnson has branched out into hotels marriott auto dealerships part ownership of the charlotte bobcats and even british drama</s>
<s>his story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i was born in hickory miss the ninth of 10 children</s>
<s>my mother was a schoolteacher and my father was a farm worker</s>
<s>we moved north to freeport ill where both of them became factory workers to earn better wages and get away from discrimination in the south</s>
<s>they taught us theres no such thing as lowly work as long as its honest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the time i went to college in 1964 there was a movement to push african americans toward higher education</s>
<s>i attended the university of illinois through the national defense student loan program and was a history major</s>
<s>after i graduated in 1968 i went to princeton which was looking to recruit minorities and attended the woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs for my masters degree</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i didnt think about going into business at first</s>
<s>after college i had a series of jobs working for the corporation of public broadcasting the national urban league and as press secretary for walter fauntroy the first dc delegate to the house of representatives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1977 i was introduced to bob schmidt president of the national cable television association and became vice president for governmental relations</s>
<s>i met the leaders of the industry and struck up a friendship with john malone then president and ceo of tci</s>
<s>he said to me im a business guy and if you have any ideas id be interested in supporting it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as an african american i had a desire to demonstrate the potential of african americans to create value wealth and opportunity</s>
<s>i wanted to share the stories of african americans that mainstream media was not covering</s>
<s>black radio was playing and black music was growing and i wanted to reach the consumers who didnt have access to it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with the evolution of satellite technology you could reach niche markets that you couldnt reach with broadcast tv</s>
<s>so i told john malone about my idea of creating black entertainment television</s>
<s>it was 1979 and he had an interest in seeing minority cable happen because he had a station in louisville that had a large black population</s>
<s>so he put the first half million in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more how we got started the blue man group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he bought 20 of the company for $180000 and loaned me $320000</s>
<s>it was a great strategy for me because if he put in the money as debt bet would be a minoritycontrolled company</s>
<s>he told me he believed id work harder for myself than i would for him</s>
<s>as we grew the company john put in more money as debt and it all got paid back</s>
<s>his initial $180000 investment netted him $700 million in stock when we later sold to viacom via</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he served on the bet board for 18 years</s>
<s>most talented african americans are not given the opportunity or access to support from someone like john malone</s>
<s>the white community knows a lot about black athletes and musicians but doesnt have the same affinity for black businessmen</s>
<s>when i would go to the bank for an investment theyd ask me who else is in the deal</s>
<s> id say john malone and you could feel the instant seal of approval</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my first problem starting bet was persuading cable operators to carry the programming</s>
<s>back then the cable system had 20 to 30 channels</s>
<s>an operator would tell me i only have 5 of blacks in my market</s>
<s>why should i give a channel to you</s>
<s> i told them that quality entertainment was colorblind and the industry had to show politically that it was diverse to be deregulated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another difficulty was the programming</s>
<s>back then hollywood wasnt producing black programming</s>
<s>the successful shows they did  the bill cosby show the jeffersons and good times  were all on the broadcast networks</s>
<s>so we would license blackoriented movies from studios that werent being released and developed original programming with africanamerican creators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we launched jan 25 1980 broadcasting two hours a week on friday nights and reached 35 million households</s>
<s>in 1981 when mtv didnt feature rap and hiphop artists it gave us an opening</s>
<s>we got free music videos from the record companies</s>
<s>we ran black college football and black gospel music</s>
<s>we served a unique audience that other businesses werent serving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1983 taft broadcasting came in as an investor with $1 million or $2 million</s>
<s>time warner twx fortune 500 started giving inkind help with cable carriage and satellite distribution in 1986 and we became cashflow positive</s>
<s>i decided to take the company public and in 1991 we became the first africanamerican company to be traded on the new york stock exchange</s>
<s>eight years later john and i were looking at the business and the market wasnt giving us the valuation it did to others</s>
<s>we were at $32 a share we ended up buying the company back at $62 a share</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more how we got started the lucky jeans guys</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shortly after that viacom approached john about buying discovery and he said you might want to talk to bob about bet</s>
<s> i was trying to buy some radio stations and was ready to close the deal when i heard that time warner and aol had merged</s>
<s>aol had paid a huge amount for content and i decided to pull back because content was so valuable</s>
<s>i talked to viacom and said that as long as we can work out some issues id sell</s>
<s>i thought there would never be a better time to maximize our returns</s>
<s>so in 2001 we sold bet for $3 billion and i stayed on as ceo through 2006</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after i sold bet i could have done nothing</s>
<s>but my goal is to prove that african americans can create wealth in every sector</s>
<s>so i decided to create a company with a diverse portfolio</s>
<s>i continued to serve as ceo of bet while starting rlj development a company i formed with tom baltimore formerly a vp with hilton hotels and purchased six hotels in 2001</s>
<s>we instantly became the largest africanamerican hotel owner in the country</s>
<s>today we have 144 hotels with an enterprise value of $28 billion</s>
<s>i started the rlj cos in 2002</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres often reluctance on the part of white business owners to cast their lot with black entrepreneurs</s>
<s>but when white americans get to know you they think heres a guy i can do business with</s>
<s>i got into private equity with the carlyle group because david rubenstein and i were both on the board of johns hopkins university</s>
<s>we created a deal rlj equity partners and are buying companies together now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>likewise i was a friend of bill clintons and got to know mack mclarty who was his white house chief of staff</s>
<s>mack said hes got some car dealerships and would like to grow them</s>
<s>so now i have 60 in it rlj mclarty landers automotive holdings and were the largest minorityowned automotive dealership in the country</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now ive come full circle with the acquisition of image entertainment and acorn media group to form rlj entertainment</s>
<s>i want to make acorn tv the brand for exciting british drama and mysteries and use images urban titles to create a digital channel for africanamerican programming along with original programming</s>
<s>were thinking of creating a hispanic channel that will be competitive with telemundo and univision next</s>
<s>the asian market would be great too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im not the smartest guy on the block but ive had more opportunities than others</s>
<s>there are two things im proudest of achieving</s>
<s>one is starting bet which will be around long after im gone</s>
<s>second my success can be used as a beacon to the broader white business community to say if bob johnson can do it then there are a lot of africanamerican guys and women who can do it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>establish strategic partnerships</s>
<s>have people who will go to bat for you vouch for you or take a risk for you when you need it</s>
<s>make those friendships before you need them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>create a brand identity</s>
<s>your brand is your personal character  what you say how you carry yourself how you respond to people</s>
<s>you have to be able to project a sense that theres value in knowing you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>let the people who work for you know that youre all in it together</s>
<s>if i make money youll make money</s>
<s>if im here working until midnight you need to be here till midnight</s>
<s>they get to ride up the elevator with you and if you dont go up theyre in the same position</s>
