<s>in the flaw of averages why we underestimate risk in the face of uncertainty stanford managementscience professor sam savage illustrates the folly of planning using averages by recounting the tale of the statistician who drowns crossing a river with an average depth of three feet</s>
<s>the rub of course is that while the stream is shallow near the shore its 12 feet deep in the middle</s>

<p>
<s>the idea of using your average life span for estimating how long your savings will have to last in retirement is similarly all wet  and could leave you in the unpleasant position of having no savings but a whole lotta living to go</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>life expectancy isnt an estimate of how long you are likely to stay alive</s>
<s>it represents the average number of years a person of a given age is expected to live</s>
<s>these days the life expectancy of a healthy 65yearold man is another 20 or so years while for a woman of the same age its an additional 22 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many people will live longer</s>
<s>as the above chart shows a 65yearold man has a 30 probability of living to 90 a 65yearold woman has a 40 chance</s>
<s>and the chance that at least one member of a 65yearold couple will be alive at 90 is higher  60</s>

<p>
<s>lets say youre 65 have $500000 and want to withdraw enough each year to live comfortably but not so much that youll spend your money too soon</s>
<s>if you assume your assets will have to support you for only 20 years you could withdraw 5 of your savings initially and then increase it for inflation each year</s>
<s>with that regimen youd have about a 10 chance of depleting your money before age 85 according to t rowe prices retirement income calculator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you live longer the probability of your money running out rises</s>
<s>at the same withdrawal rate it jumps to more than 30 if you live to 90 and almost 50 at age 95</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if life expectancy isnt the right figure for retirementplanning what is</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres no single correct figure</s>
<s>in its retirement income planner tool fidelity sets a default age of 92 for a 65yearold man and 94 for a woman</s>
<s>t rowe prices calculator uses 95 for all</s>

<s>when boston university economist laurence kotlikoff designed his esplanner retirement software he set the target age at 100</s>

<p>
<s>in reality the vast majority of us wont live to 100 or even our nineties</s>
<s>so how do you balance the risk of assuming too short a life span and spending down your assets too soon vs erring on the side of longevity and living more frugally than need be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>deciding between those two possibilities is personal</s>
<s>my take is that the prospect of having to scrimp in your final years  or worse yet depend on the kindness of others  is more unsettling than the possibility of dying with unspent assets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unless you have serious health problems or a family history of dying young plan on living into your early or midnineties</s>
<s>if your ancestors are longlived you may want to aim for 100</s>
<s>and couples may want to plan for a husband dying first since women have longer life spans on average</s>

<s>ultimately you have no way of knowing when youll depart this earth</s>
<s>even online tools that finetune your life expectancy based on your health behavior and family history  such as the one offered by northwestern mutual  produce only an average</s>

<p>
<s>given that uncertainty it pays to hedge your longevity bets another way once you retire devote a portion of your savings to an immediate annuity which pays guaranteed income no matter how long you live</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what you dont want to do is plan as if your savings need to last only for an average life span</s>
<s>do so and you could find yourself in deep water later</s>
