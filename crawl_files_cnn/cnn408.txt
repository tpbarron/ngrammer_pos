<s>new york cnnmoney  did the job market seem any better in july than it did in june</s>
<s>dont count on it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists surveyed by cnnmoney are predicting the economy added 95000 jobs last month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats only a slight improvement over the 80000 jobs added in june and is not strong enough to keep up with population growth let alone reduce the unemployment rate from its current 82</s>

<s>generally speaking todays current economic environment is not conducive to employers ramping up their pace of hiring said wells fargo economist sam bullard</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>factories which were hiring at a stronger pace earlier this year have seen their business slow</s>
<s>weak demand from abroad is part of the problem amid europes debt crisis and chinas slowdown</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>back at home american consumers are not giving businesses much incentive to hire either</s>
<s>consumer confidence fell in july and retail sales have been weak</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but its not just the hereandnow thats holding employers back</s>
<s>the bigger drag on hiring lies in the unknown that looms ahead</s>

<s>companies concerns about europe the fiscal cliff of tax increases and automatic spending cuts health care costs and regulation have now been compounded by slowing sales both in the us and around the world said lynn reaser chief economist for the fermanian business and economic institute</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thanks to congress many businesses still dont know what their tax rates will be in 2013 or where exactly the government plans to make its $110 billion in cuts when the new year triggers the socalled sequester</s>
<s>businesses that often rely on government contracts simply dont know how to plan for the year ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>weve stopped investing and hiring because we dont know what programs are going to get cut said chad moutray chief economist for the national association of manufacturers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>health care costs are also a top concern for businesses after the supreme court upheld healthcare reform in late june</s>
<s>the ruling could have an impact on small business hiring in particular given a rule that requires companies with 50 or more fulltime employees to provide health insurance for all workers by 2014 or face stiff penalties</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course the outlook isnt all negative</s>
<s>one bright spot lies in the housing sector which has recently shown some signs of improvement</s>
<s>construction spending has started to pick up and that could eventually lead to a small gain in construction jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>auto manufacturers could also make the july jobs report look a bit better than june but the effect might be artificial</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>every year in early july auto factories temporarily shut down and lay off some workers to retool their factories</s>
<s>there were far fewer of those furloughs this year and that could artificially distort the labor departments seasonal adjustments</s>
<s>the result could be job growth looks stronger in july than it actually was</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>correcting for annual shutdowns in auto production can often distort july employment figures reaser said</s>
<s>the underlying mood for hiring however remains subdued</s>
