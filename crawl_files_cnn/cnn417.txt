<s>money magazine  im trying to show patience but after several years of subpar returns from a fund in my retirement account im wondering whether i should i just pull the plug</s>
<s>how do you know when to sell an underperforming fund</s>

<p>
<s>british punk rock band the clash summed up your dilemma pretty well in its hit single should i stay or should i go</s>
<s> plagued with indecision the singer fears troubles lie ahead no matter which decision he makes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in your case if you stay you risk seeing your retirement dough languish even longer in a lagging fund</s>
<s>go and you might exit just as the fund is mounting a comeback  or end up in a worse fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as much as i wish i could neither i  nor anyone else for that matter  can give you a set of rules for making the right move</s>
<s>this is a situation where youve got to assess each case individually and apply your best judgment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what i can do however is suggest six questions to ask yourself that can help you come to a more informed decision about whether to sell or hold on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>are you comparing apples to apples</s>
<s>some investors assume theyve got a dog on their hands just because a fund gains less than other funds theyve heard about</s>
<s>but lower returns arent necessarily an indication of lousy performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before you even think of selling you want to make sure the fund is actually lagging</s>
<s>the key test how does the fund stack up against funds with a similar investing strategy</s>
<s>if youre worried about the performance of a largecompany value fund be sure to compare its returns against those of other funds that invest in shares of large undervalued companies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can do that by plugging the funds name or ticker symbol into the search box at morningstarcom</s>
<s>click on the chart tab of the page that comes up and then choose the benchmark pulldown menu</s>
<s>youll get a graph that shows whether your funds returns have lagged compared with those of other funds in the same morningstar category and if so by how much its trailed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>is the performance gap significant</s>
<s>you dont want to jettison a fund just because its not sitting at the top of the performance charts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>occasional ups and downs are normal</s>
<s>so whats a big enough performance gap to pull the trigger</s>
<s>theres no official guideline but id be reluctant to dump a fund as long as it remained in the top half of its peer group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you click on the performance tab on any funds morningstar page you can see whether it ranked in the top second third or bottom quartile versus comparable funds over a variety of time periods</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>is the fund consistent</s>
<s>ideally a fund should play a welldefined role in your portfolio providing exposure to stocks of a particular size or bonds of a certain quality and maturity</s>
<s>but managers sometimes try to juice their returns by pushing the envelope</s>
<s>the manager of a domestic largecap fund may bet on mid or smallcaps if he thinks theyre poised for a big run or even make a foray into foreign shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but such moves can backfire not to mention make it more difficult for you to know how your overall retirement account is actually invested</s>
<s>the more likely a fund is to shift its investment style the more apprehensive you should be about keeping it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by choosing morningstars portfolio tab you can get plenty of details on its current investing style and see whether that style has varied over the past five or so years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>4</s>
<s>are you overpaying</s>
<s>higher expenses dont guarantee that a fund will trail its peers but it makes it pretty likely</s>
<s>plus the fatter a funds fees the more risk it must take to compensate for the drag of higher expenses</s>
<s>and the more aggressively it invests to try to stay competitive with lowercost funds the harder its likely to get hit any time the market turns against it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if your fund is underperforming and has fees that are significantly above the average for its peers id say thats a powerful argument for looking for a lowcost replacement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to see how your funds expense ratio compares to that of comparable funds just plug its ticker symbol into cnnmoneys search box at the top of this page and scroll down to the peer comparison section</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>5</s>
<s>would selling cause a tax headache</s>
<s>if the fund is in a 401k ira or other taxadvantaged account taxes arent an issue</s>
<s>but if its in a taxable account and youve owned it long enough that you have sizeable gains despite its recent problems selling could generate an income tax bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you certainly dont want to hold off selling a true turkey because you fear the tax bill</s>
<s>but you may want to take the tax effect into account in deciding how to get out</s>
<s>for example you might consider splitting the sale between two tax years to avoid a big hit in one year</s>
<s>or you might want to wait until you go through your annual rebalancing routine to see if you might shave your tax bill by pairing gains or losses in the fund youre planning on unloading with losses or gains in a fund youre planning to hold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>6</s>
<s>how long has this been going on</s>
<s>with uptotheminute performance data available these days many investors feel they should pull the trigger at the first sign that somethings awry</s>
<s>but that can be a mistake</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many funds go through occasional rough patches only to later right themselves</s>
<s>if you bail at the first sign of subpar performance you could find yourself making lots of unnecessary switches</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres no consensus on what the grace period should be for poor performance</s>
<s>but generally id give a trailing fund the benefit of the doubt for a year or so but not more than two years</s>
<s>if a fund manager cant turn the fund around within that window its probably time to move on to a fund with a more credible track record</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one more thing the problem youre grappling with is unique to actively managed funds or funds that rely on the managers skill to outperform their peers and market benchmarks</s>
<s>you can easily get around this issue by sticking to index funds which are designed to track a specific benchmark rather than beat it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investing in index funds wont assure youll earn the highest returns although over long periods such funds do typically outperform most actively managed funds</s>
<s>but if an index fund falters at least youll know that it was because the market or index it tracks went down not because the manager screwed up</s>
