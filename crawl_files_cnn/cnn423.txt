<s>new york cnnmoney  going into adulthood witnessing a stock market collapse and hearing constant warnings about trillion dollar budget deficits low yields on savings and excessive debt is quite honestly depressing</s>
<s>given all thats going on in the world today whats your best advice for what young adults should do about money</s>
<s> jeff m denver</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even though the economy and the stock market are in better shape than they were just a few years ago many investors remain anxious about the outlook for the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if theres one thing my experience has taught me you cant let your emotions dictate your financial decisions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with that in mind here are three pieces of advice that young investors just starting out  as well as veterans who still feel rattled by the upheaval of recent years  should keep in mind while managing their finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>1</s>
<s>things are never as good  or as bad  as they seem</s>
<s>we all have a tendency to extrapolate the present into the future</s>
<s>but it makes no more sense to assume the tough times weve been experiencing will continue into the future any more than it did to presume during the dotcom boom that we had entered a new era of uninterrupted prosperity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since money published its first issue in 1972 the us economy has weathered six recessions six bear markets and dozens of other crises</s>
<s>remember the asian contagion and the longterm capital management hedge fund implosion of the late 90s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but recovery followed each setback</s>
<s>why</s>
<s>because the economy and the financial markets work in cycles with fat times followed by lean ones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the upswings typically last far longer than the downturns however its only natural that living standards and stock values tend to rise over time</s>
<s>so dont get too caught up in the mood of the moment be it gloomy or euphoric</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>2</s>
<s>take doomsayers stock market predictions with a large block of salt</s>
<s>theres nothing investment pundits and the financial press like more than writing off stocks</s>
<s>one famous example the businessweek death of equities cover story in august 1979 which contended that inflation and other woes spelled the end of competitive stock returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but investors who avoided the stock market after reading that story likely regretted their decision</s>
<s>since the story ran stocks have gained roughly 11 a year which means someone who invested $10000 in largecompany stocks back then and reinvested dividends would be sitting on an account worth about $315000 today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yes there were plenty of big setbacks along the way as there will be in the years ahead</s>
<s>but anyone willing to ride out stocks periodic nosedives stands a good chance of reaping solid rewards over the long term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3</s>
<s>focus on what you can control</s>
<s>you have no power over the returns the markets deliver</s>
<s>but you can exert some influence to improve your chances of building wealth over the long term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one way to do that is to build a broadly diversified portfolio and aside from occasional rebalancing stick to it</s>
<s>diversifying wont yield the highest returns</s>
<s>but it will allow you to limit the downside during market cataclysms making it less likely youll sell in a panic and subvert your investing strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can also boost your portfolios longterm prospects by holding the line on investment costs</s>
<s>if you stick to the lowfee index funds and etfs on our money 70 list of recommended funds for example you can easily save a percentage point or more in annual costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats like earning an extra percentage point of gain each year</s>
<s>lest you think such a margin wont make much of a difference consider this getting 7 a year instead of 6 on a $25000 investment leaves you with an extra $28000 after 25 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the area where you can really exert some control though is in deciding how much to save</s>
<s>granted living expenses and taxes can soak up a lot of your income</s>
<s>but by making a deliberate decision to live below your means you should be able to regularly stash some dough in a 401k or other savings vehicle</s>
<s>and the more you save the better off youll be should the financial markets deliver less robust returns than you expect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so start saving regularly and investing sensibly</s>
<s>that wont solve the worlds problems but it should improve your finances</s>
