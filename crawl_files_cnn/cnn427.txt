<s>money magazine  i recently heard about a new way to look at retirement that involves staying on the job but stopping your retirement account contributions so you can use them to fund a practice retirement while you continue to work</s>
<s>the concept seems appealing</s>
<s>can you tell me more about it</s>
<s> paul morgan brookhaven miss</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whether you call it practice retirement or pretirement or just think of it as a way to ease into your postcareer life while youre still working the idea is to reap some of the financial benefits of staying on the job longer while also enjoying some of the perks of retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres an example of how this idea might work lets say youre 60 years old and eager to retire at 62 when you can begin collecting social security</s>
<s>but theres one hitch your nest egg wont be quite large enough in two years to generate enough lifetime income  in addition to social security  for you to enjoy anything close to your current standard of living</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the usual advice is to keep working until age 66 or so and continue socking away dough in your retirement accounts</s>
<s>by doing so youll not only be able to retire with a much larger nest egg youll also qualify for a much bigger social security check</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but while that advice is certainly sound and what i normally recommend slogging it out for more years in the workforce simply isnt very appealing to many people</s>
<s>given the choice between spending more time in the workaday world or opting for a less cushy retirement many people might just choose to downsize their retirement dreams</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats where pretirement comes in</s>
<s>the idea is to get yourself to view those extra years on the job in a different light</s>
<s>instead of thinking of them as an unrelenting grind look at them as a chance to get a jump on some of the activities youre looking forward to in retirement traveling starting a new hobby taking adulted classes etc</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to help afford these preretirement activities you can skip or cut back on contributions to your retirement accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for many people that could free up anywhere from 5 to 15 of their income for extra spending each year although remember pretax earnings you dont stash in a 401k or similar account will be taxed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at this point i can almost hear the collective roar of disapproval from financial advisers and committed retirement savers aghast that i would even suggest such a strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stop saving</s>
<s>why if people follow that advice theyll have a smaller nest egg and less sustainable income in retirement than if they had both worked and saved a few more years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and thats true</s>
<s>except that not everyone is going to follow the right course of staying on the job and continuing to feed their retirement accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the idea behind the pretirement approach is to find a way to entice someone who might otherwise leave his job to stick it out at least a bit longer</s>
<s>that way even if he doesnt save for retirement those last few years in the workforce he will still get some of the other financial benefits of an extended career a bigger social security check a larger nest egg since he wont be drawing from it while working and fewer years of retirement to fund from savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most importantly though is that someone who stays on the job longer will be better off financially than one who leaves early even if the person sticking it out doesnt save another cent in the final years of his career</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but dont take my word for it</s>
<s>you can see how the numbers work for a hypothetical 60yearold couple who are short on savings and trying to decide whether to retire early or try out a practice retirement while still working</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i want to stress though that such a test drive funded by money that would otherwise go into savings isnt appropriate for everyone</s>
<s>if after checking out a calculator like our retirement planner you find that you dont have nearly enough resources to maintain a reasonable standard of living after retiring then the prudent choice is to remain on the job and save every penny you can get your hands on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also if youre in a 401k that offers matching funds and you decide to go the pretirement route you may still want to contribute enough to your plan to take advantage of at least some of the employer match</s>
<s>it would be a shame to give up the practical equivalent of free money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bottom line if your nest egg isnt too far short of where it needs to be getting a head start on some of the advantages of retirement may provide the incentive you need to hang in longer at your job</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>who knows</s>
<s>you may find those last few years at work more pleasant than youd imagined</s>
<s>and if nothing else youll be financially better off than if you had beaten a hasty exitÂ </s>
