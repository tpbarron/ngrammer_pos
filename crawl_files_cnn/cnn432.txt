<s>money magazine  i have a friend in his 20s who earns more than i do but doesnt participate in his 401k</s>
<s>ive told him this is a mistake but he wont save because hes worried that government policies will decimate the future value of any money he puts away</s>
<s>how can i make him realize he needs to save</s>

<p>
<s>yes government decisions on everything from taxes to fiscal spending could erode the eventual value of your friends retirement savings</s>
<s>but just because thats a possibility doesnt mean that he shouldnt be saving and investing for retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after all if your friend retires without a nest egg he will effectively be placing his retirement security in the hands of the very government he seems to have so little faith in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while its not possible to completely insulate ones self from faulty government policies there are a number of moves you can make to minimize the potential fallout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one strategy is tax diversification</s>
<s>by keeping savings in a variety of accounts that receive different tax treatment  think taxdeferred dollars in a 401k taxfree savings in a roth assets subject to longterm capital gains rates in taxable accounts  you can at least assure that the spending power of your retirement nest egg isnt tied to a single tax rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>similarly if youre concerned that government spending and borrowing might reignite inflation and send the dollar into a tailspin you can hedge against rising prices by including treasury inflationprotected securities or tips and reits in your portfolio and capitalize on dollar weakness by diversifying into foreign stock funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if your friend doesnt find these arguments compelling theres another way you may be able to convince him to contribute to his 401k  namely show him what his retirement might be like if he doesnt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>go with your friend to the social security quick calculator and have him plug in his salary date of birth and future retirement date to see what sort of benefit he might qualify for come retirement time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if your friend is 25 earns $40000 a year and works until he reaches social securitys full retirement age 67 in this case he would be on track to receive just over $18000 a year in todays dollars in social security benefits when he retires in 2054</s>
<s>that assumes theres no cut in social security payments between now and then which is hardly a given considering the shape the program is in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then ask your friend how hed feel about living on $18000 a year as thats what hed have to do if he decides to forego saving for retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you want to really hammer the message home have him speak with current retirees who are living on social security alone</s>
<s>i suspect most of them will tell him its a challenge to say the least</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can then show your friend how much better off he might be if he contributes even a modest amount  say 10 of his income annually  to his 401k andor other retirement accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>assuming his salary increases by a percentage point more than the inflation rate and his retirement investments earn a reasonably achievable three percentage points above inflation he could be sitting on a nest egg of roughly $400000 in todays dollars by the time he retires</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats enough to generate an inflationadjusted lifetime income of $16000 to $20000 a year more or less doubling the income hed get from social security alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>granted theres no assurance his nest egg will grow that large</s>
<s>and whatever its eventual size its possible that future tax hikes could result in more of his stash being diverted to government coffers than hed like</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but that shouldnt be a surprise</s>
<s>we all know that there are no guarantees in life</s>
<s>the real issue is whether your friend is taking a bigger risk by saving or not saving for retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he must come to his own conclusion of course</s>
<s>but i find it hard to imagine that any reasonable person would claim they have a better shot at a secure retirement by declining to saveÂ </s>
