<s>new york cnnmoney  im a 65yearold retiree who has a comfortable pension and retirement savings that for now at least i dont need for living expenses</s>
<s>about a year ago i moved my savings into cash because i was worried about the unstable stock market and the crisis in europe</s>
<s>i hate to see this money earn nothing but i dont want to lose it if the stock market dives</s>
<s>should i leave my savings in cash</s>
<s>invest it in shortterm bonds</s>
<s>should any of it go into stocks</s>
<s> don s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given all the turmoil in the economy and the financial markets the past couple of years its not surprising that you want to be careful about keeping your retirement stash secure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but fleeing to cash to protect your savings is an illadvised move that can backfire</s>
<s>in fact in your case it already has</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since you pulled out of the market a year ago stocks have gained almost 10 while bonds have returned roughly 7</s>
<s>which means that even the most conservative mix of stocks and bonds would have given you a much better return than say a moneymarket fund which likely earned less than 01 over the past year</s>
<s>so in the shortterm at least your gambit didnt pay off</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for the longterm moving to cash and staying put would make your savings safer in the sense that your money will be insulated from the markets gyrations</s>
<s>but theres a big drawback as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the returns on secure vehicles like savings accounts money funds and the like barely keep pace with inflation over long stretches</s>
<s>after paying income taxes on gains the real value of your savings could actually shrink as you age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if a dash into cash isnt the right way to go whats a 65yearold who doesnt want to see his nest egg scrambled to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your first move should be to adjust your focus to the longer term</s>
<s>right now youre thinking only of how to protect your savings from what may happen in the market over the next few weeks or months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>based on life expectancy for someone your age you have a 5050 chance of living another 20 years or so</s>
<s>and since life expectancy represents only the average life span you have a good shot at living much longer</s>
<s>so even though youre retired you should invest as if youll be doing so for a long time</s>
<s>i generally tell retirees they should plan as if theyll live into their early 90s longer if they come from a family with a history of longevity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that means you want to invest your savings in a blend of stocks bonds and cash that will not only give you some protection from shortterm market drops but enough longterm growth potential to maintain the purchasing power of your nest egg as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mix thats right for you largely depends on how you balance reward vs risk</s>
<s>you dont want to invest so aggressively that you end up bailing out during a market downturn and selling investments at depressed prices</s>
<s>but you also dont want to err so much on the side of caution that you relegate yourself to anemic returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theoretically the fact that you have a pension and that you dont need to tap your stash now for living expenses allows you to take a bit more risk with your investments than you otherwise might</s>
<s>in the end though you have to settle on a portfolio that will allow you to sleep at night</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can get a good sense of the tradeoff between risk and return for different combos of investments by going to morningstars asset allocator tool</s>
<s>just plug in your portfolios value then adjust the sliders to create different mixes of stocks bonds and cash</s>
<s>youll immediately see the potential return for each mix as well as its possible threemonth loss</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i stress that these are estimates not guarantees</s>
<s>but by seeing how the return declines as you opt for more security you should able to settle on an acceptable blend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you get to the point where you start tapping your savings for living expenses youll also want to check out t rowe prices retirement income calculator which can show you how long your portfolio is likely to last given how its invested and how much youre withdrawing from it each month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one note about bonds i consider a total bond market index fund a good longterm core holding for the bond portion of a portfolio</s>
<s>but with yields so low many investors are understandably concerned that bond prices could get hit if interest rates begin to rise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to the extent thats a concern you can get some protection from rising rates by investing a portion of your bond holdings in a shortterm bond index fund</s>
<s>keep in mind though that the more you devote to shortterm bonds the lower the return youll likely earn over the long run</s>
<s>you can find all the bond funds youll need as well as stock funds on our money 70 list of recommended funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line stop obsessing about the market and instead find a mix of assets that youll feel comfortable sticking with through markets good and bad</s>
<s>youll end up with better investment results and youll be better able to relax and enjoy retirement as well</s>
