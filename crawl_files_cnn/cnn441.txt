<s>missiles are only useful if you can launch them</s>
<s>when foreign countries hack our defenses that could prove difficult</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is part four of a weeklong series on the ecosystem of cybercrime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  on april 8 2010 traffic to about 15 of the worlds websites was rerouted to china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stateowned internet company china telecom tricked relays from around the world into routing traffic through its servers for about 18 minutes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it isnt publicly known what happened to that traffic when it passed through china</s>
<s>but a report filed late last year by congress uschina economic and security review commission said the hijacked traffic could easily have been captured censored or even replaced with other data without anyones knowledge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those scenarios were especially worrying to the us government since the incident affected traffic to and from gov and mil sites including those for the senate army navy marines air force defense department nasa and commerce department</s>
<s>websites for dell dell fortune 500 yahoo yhoo fortune 500 microsoft msft fortune 500 and ibm ibm fortune 500 were also affected</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it wasnt the first time  or the last  that suspicious cyber activity has been traced back to china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2008 the fbi launched operation cisco raider seizing 3500 fake networking devices that originated in china including counterfeit cisco csco fortune 500 routers purchased by us government agencies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in late 2009 google goog fortune 500 adobe systems adbe juniper networks jnpr and a dozen other technology companies were hit with a targeted attack that emanated from china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a white paper issued by security firm mcafee found that the attack could yield complete access to internal systems with the ability to collect and manipulate the companies core assets including source code</s>
<s>google went public about the attack said that some of its intellectual property had been stolen and pulled its search engine servers out of china soon after</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last month hundreds of personal gmail accounts including those of some senior us government officials were hacked as a result of a massive phishing scheme originating from china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>security experts and government officials have been quick to link these and similar attacks to the chinese government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its no secret that government agencies are under attack from china said prescott winter public sector chief technology officer of arcsight a security company owned by hewlettpackard hpq fortune 500 and former cto for the national security agency</s>
<s>its a significant problem and the government has been aware of it for the past 10 to 15 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china has repeatedly and vehemently denied any connection to the attacks and proving that beijing was behind specific hacks is difficult</s>
<s>but even if we cant trace individual attacks back to the chinese government experts say mounting evidence signals that the chinese government is sponsoring wideranging cyberattacks against the us government and corporations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a review of the scale focus and complexity of the overall campaign directed against the united states  strongly suggest that these operations are statesponsored or supported a northrop grumman noc fortune 500 white paper on the capabilities of the chinese government to conduct cyber warfare concluded</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china is likely using its maturing computer network exploitation capability to support intelligence collection against the us government and industry by conducting a long term sophisticated computer network exploitation campaign</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by 2007 the nsa said that chinese hackers had accumulated between 10 to 20 terabytes of data stolen from us government agencies and corporation  about a tenth of the information volume of all the books held by the library of congress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>us military networks were attacked 6 million times in 2006 according to the national security agency</s>
<s>by 2010 there were 6 million attacks per day</s>
<s>government officials this month acknowledged that 24000 pentagon files had been stolen in march during an organized cyber attack</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>experts agree china has at the very least stolen critical information about the us governments defense industry space program chinarelated policy and military intelligence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as much as china spies on our governments infrastructure it also spies on us corporations</s>
<s>a great number of us corporations do business in china which controls the infrastructure the companies must use to send information back and forth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many experts believe the chinese government actively spies on us corporations working in the country  just as china does to its own citizens internet communications</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>corporations cant protect themselves against that said dave aitel president of security firm immunity inc and a former nsa computer scientist</s>
<s>its the equivalent of breaking in and installing bugs</s>
<s>companies are now realizing the true cost of outsourcing</s>
<s>thats why google left google said you cant do trusted business and run a company there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont want to tell businesses not to go to china because its unsafe said jose granado leader of ernst  youngs information security practice</s>
<s>at the same time risk management is necessary</s>
<s>its important to operate with your eyes wide open there</s>
<s>china isnt iowa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so what could china do with all the information it collects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at best experts say china will be able to able quickly advance its defense capabilities and save on years of research and development for its military and stateowned technology companies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at worst the threat becomes military</s>
<s>in a war that information could be enough to delay us deployments and impact combat effectiveness of troops northrop grumman said in its assessment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its easier to go to war if you disable a countrys rocket launchers first said bill pennington ceo of whitehat security a website security company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not a farfetched scenario</s>
<s>in september 2007 israeli f15s and f16s bombed a nuclear reactor construction site in syria but syrian radars never picked up the planes crossing the border</s>
<s>thats because israel had hacked syrias radar software</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and then of course theres stuxnet a bug so sophisticated that it significantly delayed irans nuclear program</s>
<s>the worm which was likely loaded into the system on a thumb drive ordered the centrifuges in an iranian nuclear facility to spin out of control ultimately destroying it</s>
<s>while that was happening stuxnet made all the meters tell iranian engineers that everything was normal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>experts say much more needs to be done by the government and corporations to ensure our national security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem is we have this thicket of 20th century rules that dont work in the 21st century said michael chertoff former secretary of homeland security in a talk last month hosted by analytics company opera solutions</s>
<s>the concept of a person as the only threat has lost is meaning</s>
<s>it may be a server we can be at war with a network</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in other words protecting land sea and air borders wont save you if your attackers are seconds away no matter where they are</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for all the improvements that the government needs to make the private sector lags further behind</s>
<s>a recent wave of cyberthreats began to scare corporations into beefing up their security but companies have still been reluctant to spend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most big corporations are only beginning to realize whats going on and are learning how to respond arcsights winter noted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still experts say the nightmare scenario  china disabling our defenses and attacking the country  remains unlikely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us government operates on the premise that most government systems and networks have been compromised by various classes of attackers said jeffrey bernstein executive vice president of security contractor critical defence who estimated that more than 150 countries have developed cyberattack capabilities</s>
<s>still the us is the 10000lb</s>
<s>gorilla in the world</s>
<s>were the leader in these capabilities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it may surprise some that the us air forces mission statement is to fly fight and win in air space and cyber space</s>
<s> and the obama administration has taken a very proactive approach to cybersecurity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we are very well defended these days winter said</s>
<s>our agencies are not totally bulletproof because nothing is but theyre much better off than they were before</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its like the cold war said larry ponemon chairman of the ponemon institute a cybersecurity research organization</s>
<s>we have the ability to bring you down you have the ability to bring us down so no one is doing anything</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>coming friday cybercrime is everywhere but how do they break in</s>
<s>well take a look at common hacks and attacksÂ </s>
