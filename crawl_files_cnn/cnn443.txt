<s>the advantage of taking a lumpsum payout is that you retain full control over those assets</s>
<s>and unlike an annuity you can pass any leftover money to your heirs when you die</s>
<s>but taking the pension in a lump sum also means that youll be responsible for managing those assets</s>
<s>you have to ask yourself whether you want the responsibility and risk of handling this money or whether you want the certainty that comes with a guaranteed monthly pension says lyle benson a cpa and president of baltimorebased tax and financial planning firm lk</s>

<s>one other factor to consider is your life expectancy</s>
<s>if youre in a great health and feel confident that youll outlast the life expectancy used by your pension administrator to calculate your pension then the annuity might be a better option</s>
<s>however singlelife annuities come with a drawback that money ceases to be paid out when you die</s>
<s>for that reason benson recommends trying to switch to a jointandsurvivor annuity if you opt not to cash out</s>
<s>although your monthly payment would be smaller those payments would continue to your spouse if you die before her</s>

<p>
<s>benson also notes that rolling over a lumpsum pension payout to a roth ira would trigger taxes on the full amount</s>
<s>because your tax bracket is probably higher now than it will be when youre retired youre likely to be better off deferring that tax bill for now and rolling your pension assets into a traditional ira</s>
