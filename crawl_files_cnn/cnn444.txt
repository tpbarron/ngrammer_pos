<s>money magazine  im 39 selfemployed and make $200000 a year</s>
<s>i have no mortgage and have saved $12 million 75 of which is in retirement accounts</s>
<s>id like to relax and live it up a bit but im afraid that the good days might end</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my question can i finally drop $40000 on a used bmw and $50000 on a kitchen remodeling</s>
<s>or should i put that $90000 toward my two kids future college expenses which are roughly a decade way</s>

<p>
<s>being prudent doesnt mean you must live as if the bottom is going to fall out of your finances at any moment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ideally you want to achieve a balance between saving and spending that allows you to enjoy life today without pampering yourself so much that you shirk your responsibilities for the future</s>
<s>from what youve told me id say youre a long way from overindulging</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course the mere mention of a $40000 bmw will have some people accusing you of conspicuous consumption and worse</s>
<s>and you could easily find a car with a lower price</s>
<s>relative to income though you paying $40000 is roughly the equivalent of someone with the median household income paying about ten grand for a car an amount that wouldnt raise an eyebrow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for the kitchen upgrade $50000 is a considerable sum</s>
<s>but your budget is actually less than the nearly $58000 remodeling magazines latest cost vs value survey found was the average cost of a kitchen renovation</s>
<s>by the way the magazine also estimates you would recoup almost 70 of that cost at resale</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given all this you dont need to worry that you would be acting irresponsibly by refurbishing your kitchen and buying a nice used car youve had your eye on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so i say go for it on the condition that you do the following two things first continue to save for retirement via taxadvantaged plans for the selfemployed or other retirement savings vehicles second set aside enough in a 529 plan or other college savings account over the next 10 years to pay for a decent chunk of your kids education</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>considering that youre mortgage free you should have plenty of disposable income for saving</s>
<s>youve also got a good head start on the retirement front which should make it possible for you to save for retirement and education at the same time although if push comes to shove favor retirement first</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to get a sense of how much you need to save to reach these goals check out our retirement planner and our college savings tools</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is it possible the good days could end slashing your income and forcing you to cut back your contributions toward your retirement and your kids college costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure life isnt totally predictable</s>
<s>but if you run into a rough patch youll do what we all do in tough times youll adapt</s>
<s>youll reassess your goals and revise your planning based on your new circumstances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>life could get kind of grim if we denied ourselves all treats because of the chance of a financial reversal in the future</s>
<s>as long as such splurges are the exception rather than the rule all the more reason for you to enjoy them</s>
