<s>money magazine  as a vp and senior private banker at jp morgan chase in chicago terry walsh was the point person for highnetworth clients</s>
<s>hed been working his way up in banking since graduating from college</s>
<s>but all the while hed dreamed of doing something else opening a butcher shop</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was after all what his greatgrandfather had done</s>
<s>walshs father wasnt part of the business  which included 12 shops in illinois and new york  but terry remembers visiting the stores a few times</s>
<s>i was intrigued by the idea of selling good cuts of meat he recalls</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as walsh got serious about becoming a butcher in recent years he ran the idea by everyone he met</s>
<s>people told me they disliked the quality of meats at grocery stores he says</s>
<s>they couldnt find select cuts</s>
<s> he also consulted his cousins still in the business in new york on choosing meat purveyors and pricing product</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given his career in banking its hardly surprising that walsh saved up for his plan</s>
<s>by october 2008 hed socked away $120000</s>
<s>and with his office slated to move to a less convenient location in the city i felt the timing was perfect he says</s>
<s>so walsh who is single put banking behind him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he had his eye on a storefront in a hip chicago neighborhood</s>
<s>but he waited until the other tenant in the subdivided space signed on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we werent going to get foot traffic next to a nail salon he says</s>
<s>after learning it would be a wine store he jumped</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>walsh opened sterling goss a name he made up to connote quality in the fall of 2008</s>
<s>the shop grossed $180000 its first full year</s>
<s>for 2012 walsh expects sales of $320000 10 of which will be profit</s>
<s>sterling goss may not be a cash cow to date admits walsh who has three employees and hasnt yet paid himself</s>
<s>but this is my dream and im living it he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how much startup costs exceeded estimates 58</s>
<s>walsh figured his $120000 would cover inventory and buildout</s>
<s>but refrigerated cases cost more than budgeted so he had to borrow $70000 on a heloc</s>
<s>he hopes to erase the balance in five years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>salary walsh hopes to draw in 2012 $30000</s>
<s>to cover living expenses for the past three years he cashed out $80000 of his other investments</s>
<s>he also cut his costs  for example trading his lexus for a pickup that he can write off</s>
<s>ive lived frugally but eaten well he jokes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>year he expects to match his old salary 2015</s>
<s>revenue was up 10 last year</s>
<s>walsh expects growth of another 39 in 2012 once he starts selling sausages to restaurants and expands his catering business</s>
<s>if he maintains 30 yearly growth after that hell hit $1 million in revenue by 2015 and can draw a salary in the low six figures</s>
