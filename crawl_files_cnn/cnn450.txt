<s>money magazine  it seems the new mantra is that you need 100 or more of your preretirement income to live comfortably in retirement</s>
<s>but shouldnt you be able to get by with much less considering you no longer need to save for retirement and you may no longer have a mortgage</s>
<s> david kolkebeck readsboro vt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i agree that the replacement ratio or percentage of preretirement income advisers claim one needs to live well in retirement seems to have crept up over the years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when i started writing for money magazine in the 1980s people routinely referred to the 70 rule when discussing the percentage of preretirement income one ought to shoot for</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>soon 70 expanded to 80 or 90 and before long some people began suggesting that 100 was a more realistic benchmark</s>
<s>a few years ago one retirement research firm even came up with a figure of 126</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>conspiracy theorists see something sinister in this retirement income inflation ah those sly investment firms are pushing the replacement ratio higher so we have to invest more money in mutual funds and the like which allows them to collect bigger fees</s>
<s>but i think something less ominous is at work uncertainty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the simple fact is that its tough to know exactly how much income youll actually need in retirement</s>
<s>a recent study by the employee benefit research institute found that household expenditures decline later in life dropping roughly by a third between ages 65 and 85</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but that doesnt mean your spending will follow that trajectory</s>
<s>your outlays in retirement can vary widely depending on a number of factors including how closely you want your retirement lifestyle to mirror the way you lived during your career how much youve saved for retirement and your kids college expenses whether you retire with a mortgage or other debt whether you have retiree medical coverage from your company or will rely solely on medicare and how much you earned during your career</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so rather than viewing a replacement percentage as something you can pinpoint precisely think about it as a very general guideline that can help you estimate how much you ought to be saving during your career and to gauge whether youre making progress on the retirement planning front</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a baseline id start with a replacement ratio of 70 or 75</s>
<s>that should reflect the fact that many of the expenditures you face during your career  saving for retirement workrelated expenses the cost of raising kids  wont be around after you retire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most peoples tax bills also drop in retirement although the higher your income is the less youll likely save on taxes postcareer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once youre saving enough to meet that baseline you may want to consider raising your target percentage a bit  say to 80 or 90</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why</s>
<s>simple prudence</s>
<s>studies show that people have a tendency to underestimate how much theyll spend after calling it a career</s>
<s>besides a lot can go awry on the way to retirement layoffs can interrupt savings plans market crashes can slash the value of retirement accounts declining health can drive up medical expenses</s>
<s>its always nice to have a cushion if you can manage it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you expect to live large shoot for an even higher replacement percentage</s>
<s>but as a practical matter most people simply cant afford to save enough to replace 90 to 100 of their preretirement income and also meet the normal everyday expenses of feeding clothing and housing a family not to mention buying a car paying for insurance etc</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and even if you could force yourself to sock away enough to fund a lavish retirement would that make sense if doing so required you and your family to live like ascetics today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once youre within say five to 10 years of retirement youll want to switch from looking at how much income youll need to estimating the actual expenses youll have to cover in retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the best way to do that is to create a retirement budget preferably using an interactive budgeting worksheet like the one in fidelitys retirement income planner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you wont be able to predict your expenses with total precision either of course</s>
<s>but by giving serious thought to how you might actually live after you leave work and updating your budget each year as you approach retirement you should be able to get a decent sense of how much income youll actually require once you retire  and then gauge whether youre on track to achieve it given how much youre saving and how much youve already stashed awayÂ </s>
