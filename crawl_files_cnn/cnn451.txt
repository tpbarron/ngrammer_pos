<s>i was looking for something that wasnt growing and needed new life he says</s>
<s>instead i came across a product that met none of those criteria and found it intriguing</s>
<s> that was the cool dog which went out of business in 2005 because it expanded too quickly and he believes because the previous owners hadnt perfected the cake and toppings</s>
