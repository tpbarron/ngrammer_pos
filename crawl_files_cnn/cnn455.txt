<s>whoever wins on tuesday will have a big fiscal mess on his hands</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  no matter who wins the election on tuesday the next president will have to immediately stare down the countrys largest most pressing domestic problem the fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that cliff  which starts to take effect in january  includes $7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts over a decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the policies at issue are reductions in both defense and nondefense spending the expiration of the bush tax cuts the end of a payroll tax holiday and extended unemployment benefits and the onset of reimbursement cuts to medicare doctors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lawmakers must choose whether to leave in place some or all of them replace them postpone them or cancel them entirely</s>
<s>the decision will affect the economy the countrys credit rating and the us debt burden</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if left in place the fiscal cliff would lead to the biggest singleyear drop in the annual deficit as a percent of the economy since 1969</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but because it would be so abrupt and arbitrary it also could throw the united states back into a recession next year when more than $500 billion will be taken out of the economy</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>neither president obama nor mitt romney has said much about the cliff though each has been vocal on two components the expiring bush tax cuts and defense spending cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and neither has said anything about the debt ceiling which likely would be part of a fiscal cliff deal</s>
<s>the countrys borrowing limit will be reached by the end of the year but the treasury department says it can employ extraordinary measures to let the government pay its bills in full until early in 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so how would the two men vying for the white house handle things</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama tax hike on rich key</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>like many democrats and republicans the president doesnt like the automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts called for under the socalled sequester</s>
<s>he wants them replaced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time the white house budget office said the presidents senior advisers would recommend he veto any bill that averts the defense cuts while leaving intact the nondefense cuts or that fails to ask the most fortunate americans to pay their fair share</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile senior administration officials said recently that obama would veto any fiscal cliff package if it does not include an increase in tax rates for top earners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the president himself however hasnt used the word veto</s>
<s> instead he urges congress to work on those things we can agree on  namely to extend the bush tax cuts for the majority of americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in his last debate with romney obama pointedly said the defense cuts wont happen even though both parties  at least publicly  arent budging from their negotiating positions</s>
<s>then in an interview with the des moines register obama went further expressing confidence that a grand bargain on debt reduction could occur within six months of his second term if hes elected</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>elsewhere obama has not pushed for an extension of another key part of the fiscal cliff the temporary 2 payroll tax cut passed at the end of 2010</s>
<s>but that doesnt mean he wont</s>
<s>well evaluate the question of whether we need to extend it at the end of the year when were looking at a whole range of issues carney said in september</s>
<s>cnncom what to watch for tonight</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mitt romney give me time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney wants time to deal with the fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in august romney told time magazines mark halperin that if elected he would rather obama and congress postpone the tax increases and spending cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets have at least a year of runway or even six months of runway after the new president is elected so that we can have the tax reform and the military spending plans and the budget plans that are consistent with that individual selfleadership and views</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in may he said he would want to deal with these issues on a  permanent basis as opposed to a stopgap effort that would require unraveling and reevaluation he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney opposes the nearly $500 billion in cuts to defense spending called for under the socalled sequester</s>
<s>and he doesnt want the bushera tax cuts to expire for anyone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time he has promised to balance the budget in eight to 10 years without cutting defense or raising taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bestcase scenario</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lawmakers and policy experts say the best a lameduck congress can probably do before the end of the year is come up with a bridge or framework deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>broadly that might mean lawmakers postpone fiscal cliff measures for several months to a year negotiate a small amount of spending cuts and agree to strike a large deficitreduction deal by a date certain next year perhaps according to agreedupon targets for spending and revenue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but then if lawmakers failed to deliver next year the fiscal cliff or something similar would take effect</s>
