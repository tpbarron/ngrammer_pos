<s>money magazine  now that im going to be a stayat home mom im wondering whether i should roll the $24000 in my 401k into an ira account or cash it out to pay off my student loans</s>
<s>my husband makes a pretty good income but i thought that paying off the loans might make things easier on him now that well no longer have two incomes</s>
<s>what do you think should i roll the money over or use it to repay the loans</s>

<p>
<s>i applaud your desire to make things easier on your hubby since hell now be the sole breadwinner in the family</s>
<s>but i still think youre better off rolling your 401k funds into an ira account investing it in a diversified portfolio of lowcost mutual funds and letting it grow until retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason is that it usually doesnt make financial sense to withdraw funds from taxdeferred accounts like a 401k or ira to repay student loans</s>
<s>student loans tend to carry lower interest rates than the investment return your retirement savings are likely to earn over the long term plus they are often taxdeductible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that typically means the aftertax interest expense you would avoid by using the money in your retirement account to repay the loan is less than the aftertax investment gains you could collect by keeping it in your retirement account and letting it rack up taxdeferred returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if the interest savings versus investment gains calculation is a close call theres another factor thats likely to tilt the decision in favor of rolling the money over the penalty for early withdrawals from retirement accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you take money out of your 401k or ira prior to age 59 frac12 youll not only owe tax on the distributions but a 10 penalty as well</s>
<s>that means youll have to give up a lot more than a dollar in retirement savings to get a dollar of debt relief</s>
<s>for example if you want to pay off $10000 in student loans you would have to withdraw $15385 from your 401k or rollover ira in order to have enough to pay the loan after covering income tax and the 10 early withdrawal penalty assuming a 25 tax rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are exceptions to the 10 penalty for both 401ks and iras</s>
<s>based on what youve told me however its unlikely you would qualify for one</s>
<s>even the waiver for paying qualified higher education expenses from an ira wouldnt help in your case says cch tax guru nick kaster since it doesnt apply to payments on student loans that were taken out in years prior to the actual ira withdrawal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there are two other reasons i think you ought to roll your $24000 into an ira</s>
<s>the first is that if this stayathome gig is going to work you and your husband must learn to make whatever accommodations are necessary to adjust to life on a lower income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to the extent you rely on funds from a 401k or other sources to repay student debt or for that matter meet other expenses youre not living solely on your husbands income</s>
<s>so if you really want to continue being a stayathome mom you and your husband need to adjust your lifestyle and spending to the realities of one paycheck</s>
<s>better to do that right away than dip into savings and get a false sense of how youre faring under your new arrangement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally i think you should hold onto your retirement savings because it would be a shame to give up the nice little head start on your future retirement security your 401k dough represents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a $24000 balance may not seem like such a big deal now</s>
<s>but even if you dont add another cent it could grow to more than $135000 in 30 years assuming a modest 6 annual return</s>
<s>that sum could come in handy at retirement time especially if you and your husband arent able to build as large a nest egg as you might expect because of the constraints of living on one income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>who knows</s>
<s>at some point you and your husband may decide that you have no choice but to dip into your stash to meet unexpected expenses</s>
<s>and if that happens youll want to check again to see if you qualify for one of the exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty for iras</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the longer you can put off doing that the more youll have available should you need to tap this dough prior to retiring and the more youll have during retirement if you dont</s>
