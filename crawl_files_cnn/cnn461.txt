<s>money magazine  ive worked at several companies with 401k plans but none of them has offered an inverse fund or a fund that moves in the opposite direction of the market</s>
<s>i think this would be a nice diversification option to have when the market is shaky</s>
<s>is there a reason this option hasnt been available in any of my 401ks</s>

<p>
<s>i can think of a few reasons your employers might not have thrown an inverse  aka</s>
<s>bear market  fund into your 401ks lineup</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>maybe they felt that many 401k investors especially beginners wouldnt understand how the funds work</s>
<s>or perhaps they were worried about being sued by investors who jumped into these funds expecting a market decline only to lose money because the market rose instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or and i may be overly optimistic here maybe the people who oversaw your 401k plans realized that inverse funds really dont make a great addition to a portfolio designed to build a sizeable nest egg over the long term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as youve no doubt guessed im no advocate of making inverse or bear market funds part of a portfolio whether that portfolio is held in a 401k ira taxable account or anywhere else</s>
<s>my objection to these funds is simple they are designed for speculation not longterm investing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>true you can score big if you buy one just before the market takes a dive</s>
<s>for example if youd invested in the rydex inverse sp 500 strategy fund ryurx at the beginning of 2008 youd have earned almost 41 in a year the sp 500 lost 37</s>
<s>nice score</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>would you have done that</s>
<s>or would you have been more likely to buy into such a fund much later after you became convinced the sp 500s descent was for real</s>
<s>if youd held off until the beginning of october 2008  when it became clear the market had fallen off a cliff  you would have lost 10 in the fund over the next 12 months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in short these funds require powers of clairvoyance and timing that investors just dont possess</s>
<s>as for your suggestion that an inverse fund would be a good diversification option thats not the case</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>granted its possible that adding a small dose of an inverse fund to a conventional stockandbond combo and periodically rebalancing can reduce the volatility of your portfolio overall</s>
<s>but theres a huge downside since markets tend to rise over long periods these funds by their nature are likely to lose money over the long term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rydex inverse sp 500 strategy for example has posted a negative 6 annualized return over the past 10 years which means that $10000 invested 10 years ago is worth less than $5400 today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the result is that any benefit you get from lower volatility is likely to be dwarfed by the fact that an inverse fund is significantly stunting the eventual size of your nest egg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres another complication that makes inverse funds a dicey choice</s>
<s>since these funds are designed to track an index like the sp 500 on a daily basis their performance is far less predictable over periods longer than a day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the result is that investors in inverse funds could lose far more than they expected if the market rises rather than falls especially if they own the leveraged version of these funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to sum up i consider inverse funds another example of how investment firms can take a perfectly good concept  in this case index funds and etfs  and pollute it by touting dangerous variations that cater to our worst instincts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i suggest you avoid inverse funds altogether</s>
