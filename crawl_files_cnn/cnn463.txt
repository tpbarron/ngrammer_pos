</p>

<p>
<s>theres been so much finger pointing</s>
<s>hes made it seem bad to be successful and to be millionaires and billionaires said karl wellner ceo of papamarkou wellner asset management a fund with $3 billion under management</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>outside of obama calling bankers fat cats most wall street professionals point to few specifics and basically say its more of a vibe they get from the president</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wellner who emigrated from sweden in the early 1980s says his biggest concern is that the president appears to want to clamp down on the accumulation of wealth</s>
<s>its a sentiment echoed by many other top hedge fund managers and executives at financial firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres the idea that if youre successful you didnt do that on your own said sander gerber ceo of hedge fund hudson bay capital management</s>
<s>romney believes that individuals drive and willingness to work hard is what makes them successful</s>
<s> and thats a theme that resonates on wall street</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and its also a big reason why wall street has given the majority of its contributions to the republican party during this election cycle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact republican candidate mitt romney has received more than three times what obama has generated from wall street professionals according to the center for responsive politics</s>
<s>thats a sharp turnaround from 2008 when obama generated nearly double the wall street contributions of his then rival john mccain</s>

<s>beyond the rhetoric several hedge fund managers also say that while health care and financial regulation were in need of reform the president tackled them in a manner that put the government too deeply in the middle of both industries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>congress passed the doddfrank act on financial reform in 2010 but many of the rules still need to be written</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has criticized the law and said he would take steps to change it and even attempt to dismantle it</s>
<s>yet many on wall street are simply betting that romney would appoint regulators who would make financial reform less onerous</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would give carte blanche to heavyhanded regulators and just say go for it said wellner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related wall street overwhelmingly backs romney</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wall streets ire comes as many still criticize the president for not pushing back on wall street enough and see doddfrank as largely toothless</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres the idea that he wasnt willing to hold wall street over a barrel when he had them over a barrel said jeff connaughton former chief of staff to democratic sen ted kaufman and the author of the payoff why wall street always wins</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile obamas rival has made it clear that he is in favor of regulating banks</s>
<s>romneys main objection to doddfrank is that it gives big banks the implicit guarantee of further bailouts</s>
<s>wall street executives seem to believe romney would treat the industry in a more fair and balanced manner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney looks at things more analytically said wellner</s>
<s>hes more of a consensus builder</s>
<s>the president is dogmatic its his way or no way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related private equitys choice obama or romney</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while romneys experience at private equity firm bain capital has caused the broader american public to question whether he has their best interests at heart many on wall street see romneys business background as a big plus</s>
</p>

<p>
