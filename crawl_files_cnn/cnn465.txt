<s>when it comes to mutual funds investing more doesnt necessarily mean better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  im 82 my wife is 74 and our financial adviser has our portfolio of just under $1 million invested in 33 mutual funds</s>
<s>do you think thats too many ew</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yes thats way too many</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unless your adviser sees some value in you having more mutual funds than baskin robbins has ice cream flavors im hardpressed to come up with any good reason why you should spread your savings among anywhere near 33 funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theoretically one could argue that owning nearly three dozen funds might improve your portfolios performance by broadening its diversification</s>
<s>thats one reason so many investors these days are stuffing their portfolios with all sorts of dubious investments ranging from longshort funds to inverse funds to social media etfs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but when it comes to choosing investments more doesnt necessarily mean better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can get pretty much all the exposure you need to key sectors in the domestic and foreign financial markets with just a handful of broadly diversified funds</s>
<s>once you start venturing into funds or etfs that invest in ever narrower slices of the market any performance boost you get is likely to be minimal at best  and your returns could just as easily suffer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>performance aside theres also the difficulty of managing a complex portfolio</s>
<s>the more funds you own the higher the odds youll have a lot of overlapping holdings</s>
<s>that not only makes it harder to determine your true allocation to different asset classes it can turn what should be a simple exercise of annual rebalancing into a colossal headache</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so at the very least i think you ought to pare back the number of funds you own to a more manageable and sensible level</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i cant tell you exactly what the right number of funds should be in your case</s>
<s>but i can say that its possible to get adequate diversification with as few as three broad index funds  a total stock market total bond market and total international stock fund all available on our money 70 list</s>
<s>more adventuresome investors should be able to get by with somewhere between five and 10 funds</s>
<s>go beyond that number and the downside is likely to outweigh any upside</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>keep in mind too that its not just the number of funds that counts</s>
<s>equally important is that you end up with a portfolio that meets your financial needs and jibes with your tolerance for risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given your age you presumably want a portfolio that can generate reliable income to supplement social security and any pensions you and your wife may have but wont crash and burn when the financial markets take another tumble which at some point they inevitably will</s>
<s>so however many funds you eventually choose you need to be sure that your overall stocksbonds mix is consistent with those goals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally while i believe most individual investors are capable of creating a portfolio on their own that can provide secure income throughout retirement i also understand that many people prefer some handholding</s>
<s>since youre working with an adviser i gather youre in that group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so assuming you take my advice and reorganize your portfolio youll also need to decide whether to embark on this project with your current adviser or hire a new one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats up to you of course</s>
<s>but if i were you id at least talk to some other advisers if only because id have a hard time trusting the judgment of someone whose idea of sound investing involved putting me into more than 30 funds</s>
