<s>money magazine  my employer doesnt match my 401k contributions and the funds in my plan have high fees that range between 16 and 2 a year</s>
<s>should i participate in my 401k or contribute to an ira</s>
<s> carlos p philadelphia pa</s>

<p>
<s>you should almost certainly contribute to an ira</s>
<s>but that doesnt necessarily mean you ought to avoid your 401k altogether</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i realize that sounds like im waffling but im not</s>
<s>heres the skinny</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the convenience of payroll deductions and the tax benefits of a 401k usually make it worthwhile to participate in your company plan even if you dont get matching funds and the investment options arent the most economical</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but in your case the fees are so high  two to three times the average for 401k stock funds according to a recent investment company institute study  that id say investing in an ira first is a nobrainer provided youll actually fund it each year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example by stashing $5000 annually in a deductible ira that is invested in funds that charge 05 a year rather than the same amount in a 401k with no match and funds that average 16 a year you would end up with an extra $25000 or so before taxes after 20 years assuming a 7 annual return before expenses</s>
<s>clearly the ira is the better choice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course this assumes you qualify for a deductible ira</s>
<s>but even if you dont you should still be able to contribute to a roth ira either directly or indirectly by opening a nondeductible ira and converting it to a roth ira</s>
<s>and as long as youre not certain to drop into a significantly lower tax bracket in retirement a lowcost roth ira is also a better choice than your highfee 401k</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but what if building a nest egg large enough to support you in retirement requires that you save more than the $5000 annual maximum $6000 if youre 50 or older you can put in an ira</s>
<s>what if you must set aside say another $5000 a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you cant contribute more to an ira youve already hit the annual maximum</s>
<s>so are you better off investing the extra $5000 in your 401k despite the blimpish fees to get the tax benefits</s>
<s>or should you forego the tax benefits and take advantage of lower costs available in a taxable account</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres no sure answer since any analysis involves several factors that are difficult to predict the tax rate youll pay each year during your career the rate youll face when you eventually withdraw funds from your 401k and how much youll pay in taxes on the investments in the taxable account</s>
<s>you can come up with scenarios in which either of the alternatives comes out ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>generally though unless youre prepared to be extremely cost and taxconscious about investing in the taxable account by choosing lowcost index or taxmanaged funds and keeping trading to a minimum to avoid generating taxable distributions  youre probably better off putting any money beyond your ira contribution into your 401k even with its high fees</s>
<s>otherwise the annual tax youll pay on gains in the taxable account will likely wipe out any advantage from lower fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you do decide to invest in your 401k you may be able to make the best of a bad situation by avoiding funds on the plans menu that have the heftiest charges and focusing on those that arent as overpriced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if the fees on smallcap funds in your 401k are more reasonable than those on say the largecap choices use your 401k funds to get as much of your smallcompany exposure as possible</s>
<s>then emphasize largecap funds in your ira</s>
<s>that said dont go with a lowercost option if you believe that apart from its fees its an inferior investment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ideally bloated expenses will eventually become a thing of the past once the department of labors longawaited 401k fee disclosure rules kick in later this year assuming the agency doesnt postpone them again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but until your 401k fees actually decline max out that ira first</s>
<s>if you can save more go with a taxable account only if youre sure youll stick to lowcost taxefficient investments and hold them for the longterm</s>
<s>otherwise hold your nose and put the extra money in your 401k</s>
