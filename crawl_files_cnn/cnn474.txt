<s>money magazine  i work for a fortune 500 company that matches my 401k contributions in company stock which i can then reallocate to other investments every quarter if i wish</s>
<s>given that i wont retire for several decades and i think my company has great growth potential how much of my 401k do you think i should have in my companys stock</s>

<p>
<s>how do i put this</s>
<s>how about zero none nada zilch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>other than whatever shares of your company that might be owned by an index fund or other broadly diversified mutual fund thats on your 401ks investment menu i dont think you should keep a dime of your 401k in your employers stock regardless of how spectacular you may think the companys growth prospects are</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why do i take this hard line</s>
<s>one reason is common sense</s>
<s>youve already got a lot of your financial security riding on your employer in the form of your paycheck</s>
<s>investing in your employers stock only compounds the problems you might face if your company runs into trouble</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investment analysts have long known that people who concentrate their portfolio in an employers stock  or shares of any single company for that matter  dont earn high enough returns to compensate them for the extra risk they take on by holding an inadequately diversified portfolio</s>

<p>
<s>economist lisa meulbroek notes in company stock in pension plans how costly is it</s>
<s> that even employees who work for relatively safe blue chip firms are significantly worse off by concentrating their wealth in company stock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are plenty of examples that illustrate the perils of loading up on company stock</s>
<s>the most famous is enron the energy firm that was the darling of the investment community until it collapsed in 2001 taking the 401k plans of thousands of employees down with it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more recent highprofile corporate implosions like that of bear stearns and lehman bros also serve as warnings of why its dangerous to have much of your wealth invested in your employers shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and your company doesnt have to actually go belly up for you to get hurt a fact i know only too well from personal experience</s>
<s>even though i never voluntarily put a cent of my 401k dough in my employers stock i acquired a decent size stake of time warner shares over the years via matching contributions that i wasnt permitted to move</s>
<s>after the combination of the late 90s stock frenzy and the aol time warner merger in 2000 sent the price of my company shares into the stratosphere i found myself with a 401k that had roughly half of its value in employer stock i was locked into</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately as investors began to recognize just how disastrous this merger was shaping up to be the price of my company shares began to plummet</s>
<s>only when the stock neared the bottom of its more than 80 slide were plan participants given the option of moving out of our company shares</s>
<s>by then the damage had already been done in my case a loss of several hundred thousand bucks thats taken roughly a decade to recoup</s>
<s>thankfully the 2006 pension protection act has since ushered in new rules that make it much easier for 401k participants to diversify out of company stock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however there is one scenario in which holding onto company shares in a 401k could make sense</s>
<s>if someone is closing in on retirement and has a big slug of employer stock thats been acquired at very low prices over the years that person may qualify for a tax break known as net unrealized appreciation or nua by taking possession of the actual company shares rather than rolling them over into an ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i want to emphasize im not suggesting anyone invest in company shares during their career to take advantage of this strategy</s>
<s>but if someone has already acquired a large amount of company shares with a low cost basis and is nearing retirement then nua is a move worth considering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even then its important to remember that this strategy has potential downsides even beyond the risk of having so much of ones wealth tied to a single stock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line i recommend you transfer out of company shares as soon as youre legally permitted to do so and spread the money proportionally among the other investment options youve chosen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre so tempted by the growth potential of your employers stock that you simply cant resist taking a flier on it then at least minimize the potential damage by keeping your overall exposure to company stock including your 401k stock options stock grants etc to no more than 10 of your wealth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>saving and investing for retirement is tough enough</s>
<s>dont make it harder by engaging in a strategy that increases risk without a commensurate boost in return</s>
