<s>this is part three of a weeklong series on the ecosystem of cybercrime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  just how pervasive is cybercrime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are probably some corporations and credit cards that havent been hacked said kim peretti director in pricewaterhousecoopers forensic services practice</s>
<s>but you have to assume youve been compromised</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>large organized crime syndicates have been launching sophisticated attacks against individuals and major corporations for decades</s>
<s>the result of their efforts is the theft of billions of dollars every year and a large ongoing presence in many of our most sensitive computer systems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these arent petty thieves</s>
<s>theyre committing breaches like the sony sne attack that stole credit card information from 77 million customers and the citigroup c fortune 500 hack that stole $27 million from about 3400 accounts in may</s>
<s>theyre organized smart and loaded with time and resources</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not like the mafia it is a mafia running these operations said karim hijazi ceo of botnet monitoring company unveillance</s>
<s>the russian mafia are the most prolific cybercriminals in the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>organized cybercrime is a truly international affair but the most advanced attacks tend to stem from russia</s>
<s>the russian mob is incredibly talented for a reason after the iron curtain lifted in the 1990s a number of exkgb cyberspies realized they could use their expert skills and training to make money off of the hacked information they had previously been retrieving for government espionage purposes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>former spies grouped together to form the russian business network a criminal enterprise that is capable of some truly scary attacks</s>
<s>its just one of many organized cybercriminal organizations but its one of the oldest and the largest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the russians have everyone nailed cold in terms of technical ability said greg hoglund ceo of cybersecurity company hbgary</s>
<s>the russian crime guys have a ridiculous toolkit</s>
<s>theyre targeting end users in many cases so they have to be sophisticated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>where hacktivists lack patience and most fraudsters lack skill organized crime syndicates like the rbn possess the necessary tools to hack just about any target they set their sights upon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre incredibly persistent said jose granado leader of ernst  youngs information security practice</s>
<s>if it takes a year to set up their targets then theyll wait the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once a hacker in an organized crime unit has gained entry to a targeted system and reached the limit of his expertise hell send the hack up the chain to a more expert attacker</s>
<s>that continues until it reaches an organizations top hacker who will often steal whatever information the organization wants and cover the previous hackers trails</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unlike their more boisterous hacktivist peers organized crime groups dont want their victims to know theyve been attacked</s>
<s>they design their presence in their victims systems to be completely silent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because their motives are very different</s>
<s>hacktivists like anonymous are seeking attention</s>
<s>organized crime syndicates are after gobs of money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though credit cards continue to be a source of revenue for organized crime syndicates experts say theres a supply and demand issue there are so many stolen cards on the black market theyre not selling for nearly as much as they were several years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a result many organized crime syndicates are now going after bigger fish theyre engaging in corporate espionage to steal intellectual property source code and it architectural renderings that they can sell to competitors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they could go after thousands of credit cards or one very very sensitive document said larry ponemon chairman of the ponemon institute research center for cybersecurity</s>
<s>the technologies that theyre using are beyond the capabilities of most security systems</s>
<s>were defenseless against those attacks its a big problem and its only getting worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our defenselessness means these crooks are making off with a lot of money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>globally data breaches are expected to account for $1301 billion in corporate losses this year according to the ponemon institute</s>
<s>historically about 30 of that total cost has been direct losses attributable to the breaches which would mean about $39 billion will stolen in 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you think about the money that organized crime has if they throw out $100000 to attack you its hard for a corporation to fight against that said dave aitel president of security firm immunity inc and a former computer scientist at the national security agency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as hard as it is for corporations to stop organized crime groups from attacking their systems its even more difficult for law enforcement officials to bring them to justice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since its so easy to cover your trail online the fbis task isnt easy</s>
<s>its incredibly hard to prove a person orchestrated an attack when a hack took dozens of different routes to get from point a to point b</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the anonymous nature of the internet creates plausible deniability for attack sources said jeff bernstein executive vice president of security intelligence contractor critical defence</s>
<s>its hard to fingerprint the source of an attack with absolute certainty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>making things more difficult is the international aspect of organized cybercrime</s>
<s>for us law enforcement to act on foreign soil the fbi must be able to show cause</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>russia wont do anything about it so the fbi needs to dot their is and cross their ts to go after them said charles dodd ceo of cyberwarfare intelligence organization nicor global which contracts with the us government</s>
<s>but unless theyre idiots and left fingerprints all over the place these guys arent leaving any forensic details</s>
<s>bringing charges against them is very difficult</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats why most cybercrime convictions involve a stroke of dumb luck</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>good fortune played a big role in the apprehension of albert gonzalez the ringleader of one of americas most notorious organized cyber rings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2008 us law enforcement officials apprehended a hard drive of a cybercriminal arrested in turkey which contained logs of his chats with other cybercriminals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why would he keep those</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most hackers have an identity on underground chat rooms but more sophisticated criminals stay away from public or even passwordprotected boards making them more difficult to catch</s>
<s>some stay on smaller boards where they dont even use a handle  they just use numbers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>criminals deal with so many other criminals in business transactions said pwcs peretti who acted as the us justice departments lead prosecutor in the anthony gonzalez case</s>
<s>they dont know who theyre dealing with so recording chats allows them to remember others identities and whats owed to them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a search of the chats on the confiscated drive showed that the number 20167996 belonged to the lead attacker who compromised cash registers at tj maxx tjx fortune 500 stores and stole nearly 46 million credit card numbers in 2006</s>
<s>law enforcement realized that number also belonged to a hacker who attacked restaurant chain dave  busters systems a year earlier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that number happened to be used by a hacker with the username segvec which was also used by a previously convicted cybercriminal named albert gonzalez</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite the solid connection getting a conviction proved difficult</s>
<s>gonzalezs ring was known to have gained illegal access to hundreds of companies yet the prosecution could only convict him on seven indictments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats all the hard evidence we had said peretti</s>
<s>its very difficult to identify the actual person who sat behind the keyboard and did a crime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>coming thursday the story of cyberespionage that threatens our trade secrets economy and national securityÂ </s>
