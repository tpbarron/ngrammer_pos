<s>money magazine  im 57 and ive been pretty good at dodging big market downturns over the years</s>
<s>but knowing when to get back into the market is much more difficult</s>
<s>i shifted half of my $700000 portfolio to cash in may 2011 and then moved the rest to cash in may of this year</s>
<s>i still think the riskreward balance in investing is totally out of whack but im unsure whether to remain in cash or get back into the market</s>
<s>whats your advice</s>

<p>
<s>the major flaw in trying to time the market successfully is that you not only have to make one correct call but two exit at the right time and get back in at the right time</s>
<s>whats more youve got to do it again and again  as long as you invest  in the hope of coming out ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem is that its damn tough to get both calls right consistently</s>
<s>to illustrate lets take a closer look at your two moves to cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the face of it they worked kind of</s>
<s>by moving half your stash to cash in may 2011 you avoided a 19 decline in stocks between may and early october of last year</s>
<s>and by shifting the rest of your stash to cash in may of this year you sidestepped a 9 slide between may and midaugust</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but you didnt gain much</s>
<s>as a result of your moves i estimate that your portfolios value today stands at roughly $712000 a gain of about 17 from its $700000 starting balance</s>
<s>had you simply stayed in stocks your portfolio would have been worth almost the same amount about $711000 a gain of 16</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so at this point all your moves have put you ahead by a mere $1000 or just 01</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you could have done a lot better if youd been able to combine your claimed agility at sidestepping downturns with an ability to get back into the market at the right time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example if instead of allowing that first $350000 you shifted out of stocks to languish in ultralowyielding cash from may 2011 until today you had gotten back into stocks just as the market troughed in october 2011 your portfolio would be worth about $795000 today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and if you had been really skilled at capitalizing on market ups and downs you could have done better still by going entirely to cash in may of last year then scooping up cheap stocks in october 2001 selling them when the market hit a peak last april and buying stocks again in early june to ride the rebound</s>
<s>had you managed that series of moves your portfolios value would be about $930000 today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but theres a good reason you didnt do this  humans arent capable of regularly predicting market moves in advance</s>
<s>we may get some calls right but thats largely a matter of luck and i suspect selective memory in that were more likely to recall our triumphs than failures</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my advice to you stop playing this glorified guessing game with your money and adopt a reasonable and disciplined investing strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at this stage of your life you still need to grow the value of your portfolio but you also want to protect it from devastating setbacks that could derail your retirement plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the smart way to do that isnt to jump back and forth between stocks and cash depending on how you feel about the markets prospects</s>
<s>rather its to set a mix of stocks and bonds that has a decent shot at both delivering reasonable returns and providing some downside protection  and then stick to that mix except to rebalance periodically</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>had you adopted such a strategy back in may of last year by investing say 60 of your $700000 in stocks and 40 in bonds  a reasonable blend for someone your age  your portfolio would now be worth about $734000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in short youd be ahead of where you are today you wouldnt have had to shift your money around and you wouldnt be in the position of obsessing about when to get back into the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im not saying that 60 stocks40 bonds is some magical blend that will yield the best results</s>
<s>you may want to go with more stocks if youre willing to accept greater ups and downs in your portfolios value for the possibility of higher returns</s>
<s>or you may prefer investing more in bonds if you want a more stable portfolio</s>
<s>the point is that over the long term youre better off employing a disciplined strategy than relying on hunches and emotions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so i urge you to rethink the way you manage your investments</s>
<s>either that or relegate yourself to an endless and ultimately fruitless guessing game of where and when to move your moneyÂ </s>
