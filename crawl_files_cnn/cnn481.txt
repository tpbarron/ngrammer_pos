<s>with anxiety about the market running high and yields on bonds and cds exceedingly low dividendpaying stocks and funds have become the darlings of savers like you who are looking to generate a steady income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far this year investors have poured $22 billion into mutual funds and etfs that specialize in dividend stocks even as theyve yanked $25 billion out of all other stock funds and etfs according to epfr global</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>think twice before you join that hot pursuit</s>
<s>while its true that money has long recommended dividends for income investors i find that many people have an unrealistic view of what these stocks can do for them  and underestimate the potential risks especially at todays prices</s>

<p>
<s>the dividend illusion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you might think that by living off dividend payments youre avoiding the sin of dipping into capital</s>
<s>but thats just an illusion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because cash the company once had in its coffers is being paid out to shareholders the stock of a company that declares a dividend subsequently drops by the amount of that payment</s>
<s>yet with so many things going on at once in the market this is easy to miss</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you invest say $100000 in 1000 shares of a stock that sells for $100 and pays a 50Â¢ashare quarterly dividend you would still have your original hundred grand assuming the stock didnt move for any other reason except that youd end up with $500 in cash and $99500 in stock</s>
<s>spend that $500 and youve essentially dipped into your capital</s>

<p>
<s>youll be no better off than the owner of 1000 shares of a $100 nondividendpaying company who sells five shares for $500  a strategy that the late economist merton miller famously referred to as creating homemade dividends</s>

<p>
<s>when you rely on dividends youre tying your cash flow to a corporate policy decision that has nothing to do with your needs</s>
<s>selling shares by contrast lets you control how much money youll get from your nest egg and when</s>

<p>
<s>the upside of selling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and with investments you own outside of retirement accounts taxes can differ</s>
<s>when you get a dividend the entire amount is taxable when you sell a stock or a fund you pay taxes only on the increase in value over your purchase price</s>
<s>by cashing out shares with the smallest gains  or ones with a capital loss  you may be able to minimize or avoid that tax in some years</s>
<s>thats much harder to do with dividends</s>

<p>
<s>should congress fail to extend the tax cuts scheduled to expire this year this tax advantage could widen as the current maximum 15 rate for qualified dividends would go to 396 while the top rate for longterm capital gains would rise to just 20</s>

<s>the myth of safety</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another appeal of dividend payers is their perceived security</s>
<s>and its true that the stocks typically hold up better when the market falls</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the more you tilt your portfolio toward dividendpaying stocks the less diverse it will be</s>
<s>of the 3696 stocks in the wilshire 5000 stock index only 40 pay a dividend</s>
<s>right there youve eliminated roughly 60 of us stocks from consideration</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the stocks you end up owning will be largely concentrated in a few pockets of the market</s>
<s>in mid2012 for example vanguards dividend appreciation etf vig had more than 50 of assets in two sectors industrials and consumer stocks</s>

<p>
<s>if you buy only highyield stocks says dartmouth finance professor kenneth french the sacrifice in diversification is huge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this can be a problem if the sectors delivering the most yield get whacked</s>
<s>which is exactly what happened during the financial crisis dividend etfs that were heavily invested in financial stocks saw prices plummet by as much as 60 from 2007 to 2009</s>

<s>im not predicting that dividend stocks will melt down as spectacularly again</s>
<s>but with investors flocking to them  driving the pe ratios of the highestyielding stocks 25 to 30 above where they normally stand relative to the market  they are vulnerable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rather than relying on dividends take a more balanced approach</s>
<s>start with a mix of stocks and bonds that gives you a reasonable tradeoff between growth and security  say 50 each</s>
<s>then using a total stock and a total bond market index fund as guides make sure you are well diversified</s>
<s>today youd collect about 2 in interest and dividends from that portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you need to supplement that  and you probably will  do so by creating homemade dividends</s>
