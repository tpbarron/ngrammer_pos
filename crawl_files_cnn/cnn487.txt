<s>money magazine  what percentage of my 401k and other investments should be invested in international funds</s>

<p>
<s>with all the problems europes been going through lately including credit rating agency fitchs downgrade of spains debt to nearjunk status im sure many people would say the answer is zero</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but its a mistake to base any investing decision solely on the news of the moment</s>
<s>after all it was just 10 months ago that many investors began fleeing us stocks after standard  poors downgraded us treasury debt from aaa to aa</s>
<s>but those who did likely regretted the decision as us stocks have gained roughly 10 since then</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while much international financial news is scary these days no one really knows how foreign stocks will perform versus us shares in the years ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that uncertainty is one of the two reasons to diversify internationally in the first place</s>
<s>you want to hedge your bets rather than put all your dough in any single market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other reason is that by adding some foreign funds to an allus portfolio you can actually lower the volatility of your portfolio without sacrificing return over the longterm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when it comes to investing in foreign funds the real issues are how much exposure to international markets do you need in order to reap that riskreducing diversification benefit</s>
<s>and whats the best way to get it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many advisers these days recommend putting 40 or more of the stock portion of your portfolio into foreign funds</s>
<s>frankly i think thats a bit much</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a study last year by vanguard shows that you get virtually the same diversification bang for your buck at a 30 allocation as 40</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and recent research by wealthcare capital management ceo dave loeper  one of the rare independent thinkers in the investment world  suggests that 10 to 20 is sufficient</s>
<s>he typically uses 15 in the portfolios the company creates for its clients</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so while im sure one can make a case for a higher or lower percentage investing anywhere from 15 to 20 of your stock stake in foreign shares strikes me as reasonable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for how to get that foreign exposure i think the easiest and most effective way is to invest in a total international stock index fund or etf both of which are available on our money 70 list of recommended funds</s>
<s>in a single fund youll get the entire global stock market outside the us  europe asia all the developed countries emerging markets the whole shebang</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more since such funds invest their money based on the percentage of total foreign stock values each country represents trouble spots like spain and greece account for only a tiny portion of fund assets 16 and 01 respectively</s>
<s>which means if youve got 20 of your assets in a total international stock fund you effectively have just 032 of your money in spain and greece combined or less than a third of a percent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not to say that woes in these or other countries might not trigger major upheavals in markets both here and abroad</s>
<s>in todays highly connected economies and financial markets problems in almost any country can cause ripples if not tsunamis in other parts of the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the fact that you never know where trouble might start or where it will cause the most damage is all the more reason to diversify broadly around the globe</s>
