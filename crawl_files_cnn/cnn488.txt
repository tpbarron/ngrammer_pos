<s>money magazine  what is an appropriate or common percentage of income for a family to spend on vacations</s>
<s> darcie and jim alexis</s>

<p>
<s>here are a couple of facts to consider as you plan your next vacation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>american households expect to spend about $1200 per person on summer vacations according to a just released american express survey</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>assuming a median household income of roughly $50000 a year and an average household size of two to three people that translates to an estimate of 5 to 7 of income going toward vacations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a rough estimate at best</s>
<s>some people will spend more others much less</s>
<s>and given the still lofty unemployment rate im sure many people arent taking any vacation at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even though you can easily view average spending in mindnumbing detail for all sorts of things although not vacations in the department of labors consumer expenditures survey that doesnt mean you should take your cues from what other folks do or dont spend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just because your fellow citizens spend a certain amount on a given product or service doesnt mean its financially responsible to do so</s>
<s>after rebounding to more than 6 during the financial crisis the us savings rate has sunk to just below 4</s>
<s>thats better than the average level of about 16 in 2005</s>
<s>but its still low enough to make a case that americans should consider reining in their spending in any number of areas so they can save more for their financial security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres an even more compelling reason you shouldnt let other peoples spending habits dictate your own</s>
<s>our spending reflects our priorities</s>
<s>we have a finite amount of money so the way we dole it out amounts to a personal ranking of how important we consider various things</s>
<s>and what sits at or near the top of someone elses hierarchy may not deserve as lofty a spot in yours</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take me</s>
<s>i couldnt care less about fashion so i spend very little on clothing</s>
<s>on the other hand every year i go on stubhub hold my nose and splurge on a couple of tickets to an iggles game so my son and i can enjoy an afternoon of football and cheesesteaks in my native city of philadelphia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it doesnt really matter how your spending breaks down</s>
<s>if you prefer to overspend in one or two areas that are especially important to you thats fine as long as you hold the line somewhere else and dont lose control of your spending overall</s>
<s>what counts is that you set aside enough income for saving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rather than obsessing about specific expenditures try the twoline budget technique write your income on line one and list a target percentage of income you intend to save say 10 to 15 on line two</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as long as youre socking away that percentage on a regular basis and reasonably confident that percentage is sufficient does it really matter whether you indulge yourself on vacations but economize on cars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said just as your spending should reflect your personal tastes so should your budgeting process</s>
<s>if you prefer a more traditional budgeting technique fine</s>
<s>peruse money 101 on budgeting and these budgeting and saving tips</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so spend whatever you like on vacation and have a good time</s>
<s>as long as youre meeting your other financial obligations and saving enough dont worry whether the tab is higher or lower than anyone elses</s>
