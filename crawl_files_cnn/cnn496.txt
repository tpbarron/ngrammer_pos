<s>money magazine  im worried that our incompetent politicians will screw up the current bull market and cause even worse economic damage than weve seen in europe</s>
<s>so im thinking of getting out of us stocks and going 100 into international shares</s>
<s>is this a good idea</s>
<s> mb san antonio texas</s>

<p>
<s>let me get this straight</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to protect yourself from the chance that american politicians might make a hash of things you plan to put all your money into international stocks even though foreign politicians have already shown theyre more than capable of wreaking the very kind of havoc you fear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sorry but this is a terrible idea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not that i doubt political decisions can affect financial markets</s>
<s>clearly decisions about taxes government spending and monetary policy can have a significant impact on economic growth and market performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and i certainly dont hold us politicians in especially high regard when it comes to their handling of economic matters</s>
<s>at the same time though i dont see any reason to assume that homegrown politicos are more likely to exercise poor judgment in the economic sphere than their counterparts abroad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so your plan to pull out of the worlds single largest stock market because you think american pols will screw up more than foreign ones strikes me as a flimsy investing premise at best</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i have a better idea</s>
<s>do what prudent investors usually do when facing uncertainty spread your money around in this case by holding both us and international shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reasonable people can disagree about how much of each you should own but advisors typically recommend devoting anywhere from 10 to 30 of your stock stash to foreign shares</s>
<s>you can do more if you like</s>
<s>but research shows that going beyond 30 doesnt appreciably improve performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whatever percentage you decide on you can get all the foreign exposure you need by going to our money 70 list of recommended funds</s>
<s>there you can create a diversified portfolio of foreign shares by assembling different funds or etfs that focus on particular market segments  developed countries emerging markets large shares small etc</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or you can simply invest in a total international stock fund vgtsx or etf vxus which has large and small shares from virtually every country and region in one fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you want to make things really easy on yourself you could buy a world stock market index fund vtwsx or etf vt</s>
<s>this will give you the entire global stock market  the us europe japan china emerging markets  in a single portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one caveat a world index fund divvies up its holdings based on the percentage of global stock market values each country represents</s>
<s>and since the us accounts for about 45 of total stock values around the world holding only a world stock market index fund would mean upwards of 55 of your money sits in foreign shares</s>
<s>i consider that rather high although still preferable to going 100 international</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is another option vary your exposure to specific foreign markets based on how you think each is likely to perform in the coming year or so</s>
<s>if you go this route however you cant expect to succeed just by making judgments about the quality of each countrys politicians</s>
<s>youve got to do some real analysis like digging into each nations growth prospects gauging the outlook for its currency deciding whether its stock market is reasonably priced etc</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>frankly i doubt that most individual investors have the time inclination or expertise to pull this off</s>
<s>if you want to try though there are more than enough singlecountry and regional funds and etfs available to create an international portfolio that reflects your reading of the global markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but whatever you do dont shift all your dough out of domestic shares and into foreign ones</s>
<s>thats the kind of move id expect from an incompetent politician not an investor</s>
