<p>
<s>at first glance your strategy of loading up on equities to quickly bulk up your 401k and retire on schedule sounds smart</s>
<s>after all stocks usually generate the highest returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>problem is stocks impressive longterm gains are sometimes interrupted by decadelong stretches when they languish</s>
<s>far from churning out their historical 10 annualized gains since 1926 stocks lost 10 from the beginning of 2000 through the end of 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>worse yet equities periodically go into gutwrenching nosedives like the 50plus plunge from 2007 to 2009</s>
<s>hit a patch like that as you near retirement and a stockheavy portfolio may work more like an anchor than a life preserver</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if youre fortunate enough to skirt a market stall or a hammering shifting to a more aggressive allocation may not be the panacea you think</s>
<s>saving more and postponing your retirement by a few years if you can  many workers retire earlier than expected  are safer and more effective than any portfolio moves you can make</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to illustrate take the case of a hypothetical retirement saver whos also 57 and has $400000 saved</s>
<s>while that nest egg seems sizable and far exceeds what many have it falls short of widely used benchmarks for his age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as you can see from the graphic funneling more dollars into his 401k every pay period nudges up his chances of reaching his retirement goal  but only marginally so</s>
<s>thats largely because retirement is near</s>
<s>starting to salt away more say in his early fifties would have had a bigger impact</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>getting aggressive with his portfolio helps too but carries more uncertainty and the risk of a lower income if a bear market strikes again</s>
<s>the extra savings option is a better move but neither shift ensures a secure retirement at age 65</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what really helps is what youre already planning to do working longer</s>
<s>this strategy has a twopronged effect more time on the job means more years of 401k contributions and investment returns plus working three years longer increases the social security benefit by 25 or so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so rather than going pedaltothemetal with your 401k investments i recommend that you put 60 of your portfolio in a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks and the rest in bonds  a reasonable mix at your age</s>
<s>then hike your savings rate and stick with your plan to work longer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that strategy which you can test by going to t rowe prices retirement income calculator will give you a better and safer shot at accumulating the nest egg you needÂ </s>
