<s>new york cnnmoney  if youre investing for retirement that is still more than 20 years away and you do not have inclination to sell when stocks take a dive is there any advantage to owning bonds at all</s>
<s>or are bonds only for scaredy cats who will sell their stocks during a market plunge</s>

<p>
<s>its easy for longterm investors like you to think bonds are nothing more than a drag on returns and undeserving of a place in your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after all if you check out ibbotson associates classic yearbook a compendium of stock bond and treasury bill returns since 1926 youll find that stocks have not only outperformed bonds over the past 86 years  earning an annualized return of 98 vs 54  theyve also beaten bonds much more often than not over rolling periods of five 10 and 20 or more years within that span</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but i wouldnt say that theres no advantage to owning bonds</s>
<s>nor would i recommend that an investor even one in it for the long term invest only in stocks</s>
<s>while history shows what happened before it doesnt predict how things will play out in the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>true stocks have beaten the pants off bonds in the past</s>
<s>and i fully expect stocks to continue to do so over long periods in the future</s>
<s>but im not convinced enough to make an allornothing bet on stocks</s>
<s>when dealing with uncertainty and your retirement money its prudent to hedge your bets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres another compelling reason for longterm investors to own bonds</s>
<s>as impressive as stocks gains have been theyve come with quite a bit of drama</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from march 2000 to october 2002 the standard  poors 500 index dropped almost 50</s>
<s>it no sooner recovered when it fell again this time by nearly 60 from october 2007 to march 2009</s>
<s>over the 10year stretch from 1999 through the end of 2008 stocks posted a negative 14 annualized return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i mention these figures for two reasons</s>
<s>one is to prevent you from committing what stanford professor sam savage calls the flaw of averages or the fallacy of using single numbers to represent uncertain outcomes</s>
<s>by focusing on stocks longterm annualized gains you may overlook how far they have fallen and how long theyve remained depressed en route to those gains</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other reason is that even though you think youre in for the longhaul now  when the dow has been on a roll  its been my experience that most investors feel differently when things fall apart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people get very upset when they see the value of their retirement savings drop by half  or more as investors in the technologyheavy nasdaq stock index discovered when it plummeted almost 75 from the beginning of 2000 through mid2002</s>
<s>to this day nasdaq is still 35 or so below its peak nearly 10 years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even the most steadynerved investors can end up panicking like scaredy cats during major market crises and find themselves fleeing the stocks they swore theyd stick with</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and even if you do manage to resist the urge to bail during periods of upheaval youll find that its no picnic waiting until the money you invested at the top of the market slowly crawls its way back to even</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally its not as if stocks longterm gains are guaranteed even if you do hang in there</s>
<s>stocks are capable of generating a range of returns</s>
<s>when you invest in stocks you shouldnt assume youre going to earn a given return</s>
<s>rather you should think in terms of probabilities with your chances of earning returns at the top of the range lower than your odds of earning those at or below the middle of the range</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the same goes for bonds except that the range of potential returns isnt as wide because theyre not as volatile</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by adding bonds you do reduce your potential upside</s>
<s>but because bond values dont drop as steeply as stocks you also reduce your potential downside</s>
<s>so mixing some bonds into your portfolio softens the ups and downs and narrows the range of future outcomes</s>
<s>or to put it another way it gives you a better idea of how much money you may end up with although it by no means is a guarantee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for a look at just how much adding different amounts of bonds to an allstock portfolio might limit the potential upside and buffer you from the downside you can check out morningstars asset allocator tool</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im all for investing fairly aggressively when youre young and have decades until retirement</s>
<s>but i also think its important not to overdo it</s>
<s>i dont like the idea of allstock portfolios if for no other reason than its generally a good idea to hedge your bets  at least a bit</s>
