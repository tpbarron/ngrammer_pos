<s>how much longer will most of us have to work</s>

<p>
<s>the answer depends on how successful youve been at saving how cushy a lifestyle you would like to have and of course when you prefer to disengage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said after the battering 401ks took during the financial crisis a lot of people feel theyll have to stay on the job beyond the traditional age of 65</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a recent wells fargo survey 12 of affluent americans estimated that theyd have to work until age 80 to live comfortably in retirement</s>
<s>okay thats extreme</s>
<s>but when sunamerica financial group surveyed preretirees last year it found that workers were expecting to exit at 69 on average up five years from a decade earlier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres no doubt that if youve fallen behind in your retirement planning staying in the workforce longer can dramatically improve your chances of achieving a secure postcareer life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youll have more years to contribute to your retirement accounts and your investments have more time to grow</s>
<s>and the combination of extending your career and postponing social security can often boost the size of your benefit by 8 or more for each additional year you toil</s>
<s>every extra year you work is also one fewer that your savings will have to support</s>
<s>that alone reduces the chances that your savings will run out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those are just the financial benefits research shows that as long as youre not slogging away at a job you abhor working can improve your physical and psychological wellbeing and keep you more socially engaged</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as helpful as postponing your exit can be relying on a longer stint at work to improve your retirement prospects can backfire</s>
<s>why</s>
<s>just because you want to stay on the job doesnt mean youll be able to</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a survey last year by the society of actuaries shows a big disconnect while only 37 of workers said they expect to retire before age 65 more than 80 of current retirees left their jobs before that age</s>
<s>undoubtedly some got out early because they had the financial wherewithal to do so</s>
<s>but according to the employee benefit research institutes 2012 retirement confidence survey about half of retirees leave the workforce earlier than planned</s>
<s>top reasons health problems being forced out of a job or having to care for a spouse or other family member</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>similarly even though polls report that 70 to 80 of preretirees plan to include parttime or some other type of work in their retirement routine ebri found that only 27 of current retirees have done so</s>
<s>future retirees may buck the trend  or find that landing a job isnt so easy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when you base your planning around the premise that youll have lots of time on the job and those extra work years dont materialize you could find yourself with a nest egg thats too small to support you  and very few options for growing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i think the smarter strategy is to set a reasonable retirement age  say 65 or your age for collecting full social security benefits 66 to 67 these days  understanding that you may not hit it exactly</s>
<s>then periodically check your progress using an online tool like the trowe price retirement income calculator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can move up that goal if youre doing well</s>
<s>but if within 10 to 15 years of your planned exit you find youre behind ratchet up retirement contributions as much as possible</s>
<s>as the graphic shows that may not improve your prospects quite as much as working a few more years but itll leave you in much better shape should you find yourself unable or unwilling to stay on the job</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if waiting turns out to be your only option fine</s>
<s>you do what you have to do</s>
<s>retirement life will be a lot more enjoyable however if working longer is something you do because you want to not because you have no choice</s>
