<s>new york cnnmoney  im 28 and on track to save 40 of my salary in retirement and other accounts this year</s>
<s>i wonder though whether im focusing too much on stashing away money rather than enjoying it more at my age</s>
<s>am i overdoing it</s>

<p>
<s>theres no question that youre socking away money at a much higher rate than most people are able to manage financially or would chose to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a 2010 aon hewitt survey of contribution rates to 401k plans shows participants in their 20s contribute 5 of salary on a pretax basis compared to a rate of about 7 for participants of all ages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>clearly youre a champion saver</s>
<s>does the fact that youre saving so much more than your peers mean youre overdoing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if overdoing it means saving more than is necessary to fund a comfortable retirement then sure its possible youre going overboard in that sense</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>say you want to retire at age 65 on 80 of your preretirement salary</s>
<s>if you go to our what you need to save calculator and plug in your age and an annual salary of say $40000 youll see that the recommended savings rate is just over 9  and thats if we assume you havent saved a dime to date</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course youll have to save considerably more if you want to retire early or live large after you call it a career</s>
<s>you can try different retirement ages and target retirement incomes using t rowe prices calculator</s>
<s>but its hard to imagine youll fall short of a secure retirement at any reasonable age if you consistently save 40 of your salary a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ah but is it really likely youll be able to continue this pace throughout your career</s>
<s>my guess is that as you get older and take on more financial obligations like maintaining a house and raising kids youll find that it gets tougher to save</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there may also be periods where saving is a challenge</s>
<s>at some point over the next few decades you could find yourself out of work due to a layoff or health issues or some other reason for example</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if things get bad enough you could end up having to draw down your savings in order to get by as many diligent savers have been forced to do as a result of the recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given all that can happen between now and your eventual retirement i dont think that saving at such a high rate today translates into saving too much</s>
<s>you could look at your current savings rate as a precautionary measure a way to ramp up your nest egg while youve got the spare cash to create a cushion should you find it more difficult to save later on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for the question of saving for the future versus enjoying your money today i suppose you could say youre saving too much if your penchant for saving interferes with leading the life you want to live preventing you from traveling socializing with friends or buying a bigger home or nicer car</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not as if someone is forcing you to put this money away</s>
<s>youre probably saving because you derive pleasure from doing so</s>
<s>people who set goals and take steps to achieve them such as saving and controlling debt tend to be happier than those who dont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line as long as your savings rate isnt interfering with your life then i wouldnt worry about it</s>
<s>after all the worse that can happen is that you end up being able to retire earlier</s>
