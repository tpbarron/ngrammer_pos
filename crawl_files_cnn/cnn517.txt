</p>

<p>
<s>but manufacturing is rapidly being transformed from a laborintensive field to a hightech one</s>
<s>the change and a nascent pick up in domestic manufacturing has created thousands of factory jobs nationwide that experts say more women are starting to seek out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>women are very detailedoriented said senase</s>
<s>you need that approach in manufacturing today because the work is so much more precise</s>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>tom and diana peters  the husbandwife team that runs symbol job training  are on a mission of their own</s>
<s>they want to enroll more women students in their school</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the stereotype is that factory jobs require a lot of heavy lifting said diana</s>
<s>its the complete opposite</s>
<s>so much of manufacturing today is hightech and computerized</s>
<s>women can do these jobs and be very successful</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the peters trade school was formerly a familyrun toolanddie shop before diana a company executive bought it and transformed it into a manufacturing trade school in 2005</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we saw the need to establish a vocational school because of a skilled labor shortage in the area she said</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>related manufacturing is my future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>diana is already a role model for women students because its rare to have a manufacturing school owned and operated by a woman said tom director of business operations</s>
<s>and by hiring senase the peters hope to further demystify the industry as a boys club</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>senase showed a knack for the trade early on</s>
<s>she took several shop classes in high school and started winning competitions</s>
</p>

<p>
