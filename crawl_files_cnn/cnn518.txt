<s>money magazine  how and when can small investors buy facebook stock</s>
<s> kr green valley ariz</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>assuming the muchballyhooed initial public offering of facebook comes off later this week you should have no trouble getting facebook shares</s>
<s>however its highly unlikely youll be able to get them at the favorable initial offering price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as soon as the ipo is completed and shares begin trading youll be able to buy them at the market price through any brokerage firm</s>
<s>the more important question though is should individual investors be buying facebook stock</s>
<s>i say the answer is no with a few exceptions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the value of the shares you intend to buy represents only a tiny portion of an otherwise broadlydiversified portfolio  or youre investing a sum thats not really meaningful to you  i suppose i could see taking a flier on facebook</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or if facebook eventually becomes part of a broad benchmark like the dow jones us total stock market index dwcf  as google goog fortune 500 did about a month after its ipo in 2004  id have no problem with individual investors owning facebook shares within an index fund or etf that tracks the index</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>otherwise i think youre better off just watching the whole facebook frenzy from afar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason is that i dont place a great deal of trust in the ipo system as practiced on wall street these days</s>
<s>shares are doled out to investment banks institutional investors and big customers by some brokerage firms at the initial offering price which is set by the underwriters before the stock is available to the public</s>
<s>in this case that price is expected to be between $34 and $38 a share</s>
<s>but with rare exceptions individual investors cant buy at that price</s>
<s>they buy at the market price once the companys shares start to trade publicly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and in highly anticipated ipos its not uncommon for the market price to skyrocket as small investors and others shut out of the initial offering scramble for shares</s>
<s>the result is that smaller investors often pay a huge premium over the offering price making them vulnerable if shares subsequently sink but almost assuring a profit to the privileged investors who got in early</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the whole process is so choreographed and ripe for potential abuse that i think small investors should just steer clear of ipos especially hot ones at least until the hysteria dies down and share prices reflect fundamentals more than raw emotion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but theres another compelling reason i think small investors should pass on facebook at least for now theres just too much uncertainty surrounding the stocks potential</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if you think facebook is a truly transformative company and you passionately believe in the company culture that founder mark zuckerberg refers to as the hacker way the central issue from an investing standpoint is whether the company can generate enough revenue and profits to justify the price you end up paying for your shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that can be a tough call with any company</s>
<s>but its even tougher when youre dealing with a young company thats still trying to find a way to effectively monetize its 901 million active monthly users not to mention one that operates in the fastmoving tech world where todays leader can be tomorrows laggard see yahoo</s>
<s>throw in the euphoria that often surrounds a muchhyped ipo and i think investors who jump in quickly run a big risk of overpaying</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more on facebooks ipo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not to say that buying facebook shares might not pay off big time</s>
<s>investors who got into google goog fortune 500 in the wake of its ipo have done splendidly</s>
<s>but we tend to think less about the companies that struggle after going public groupon grpn is down roughly 60 from its firsttradingday high of $31 and we often forget about those that simply crashed and died</s>
<s>remember 2000 when the internet bubble burst</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>buying into facebook now is as much an act of faith as a rational investing decision based on the numbers</s>
<s>thats no way to invest retirement savings or any other money youre really counting on for financial security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if youre willing to incur the risk and uncertainty for the possibility of a big gain  or you just want to gamble with a little mad money  fine</s>
<s>but even then i think you should first take a gander at facebooks registration statement  and especially the risk factors section  so you have a better sense of what youre getting into</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and if you find this document is simply too dense to wade through maybe thats a sign you should pass on buying facebook now after all and instead opt for a small piece when it becomes part of an index fund or etf</s>
