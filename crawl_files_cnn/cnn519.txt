<s>money magazine  are reits a safe investment for ones retirement years</s>

<p>
<s>theres no doubt that reits have delivered impressive longterm gains with annualized returns of more than 10 for the past 10 years</s>
<s>and with dividend yields ranging from more than 3 to almost 8 in recent years reits have long been a goto investment for retirees looking for reliable income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but make no mistake</s>
<s>despite their ability to throw off income reits are still equities and can be just as volatile as other stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the doublewhammy of the collapse of the real estate market and the financial crisis sent reit shares plummeting nearly 50 from the beginning of 2007 through 2008</s>
<s>reits also lost 15 of their value in the third quarter of 2011 amid concerns that debt problems in europe could undermine the recovery in the us</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so just as ive cautioned about other types of dividendpaying stocks and mutual funds it would be a mistake to underestimate the risk of owning reits</s>
<s>just because they make regular income payments they are not higher yielding substitutes for bonds or cds</s>
<s>reits are far more volatile and should be considered part of the equity portion of your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre considering reits understand that there are many different types</s>
<s>the stats i mentioned above apply to the ftse nareit all equity reit index a broad reit benchmark</s>
<s>but performance can vary greatly depending on what type of properties a reit owns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last year for example while the ftse nareit index returned 8 reits that invested in selfstorage facilities gained 22 while lodging and resort reits lost 14</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two types of reits you need to be especially wary of are nontraded reits and private reits</s>
<s>these reits do not trade on an exchange which makes it much more difficult for investors to assess their value</s>
<s>that alone is reason enough to give these reits a pass in my opinion</s>
<s>but if youre tempted to take a flier on them perhaps reading the financial industry regulatory authoritys investor alert on nontraded and private reits will convince you to steer clear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reits can still be a good complement to a core portfolio of stocks and bonds for retirees as well as other investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not just because of the reliable dividends they pay</s>
<s>equally important is the diversification they bring to a portfolio</s>
<s>even though reits themselves can be volatile they dont always move in synch with the rest of the stock market</s>
<s>as a result adding reits can actually dampen the ups and downs of your overall portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are two keys to reaping that smoothing effect</s>
<s>the first is moderation</s>
<s>keeping 10 or so of your portfolio in reits is sufficient to lower volatility while possibly increasing return at the same time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other key to harnessing the benefit of reits is to stick to mutual funds that own a broadly diversified mix of reits or better yet a fund or etf that invests in an index of reit shares</s>
<s>that way youll avoid the risk of pouring your money into the wrong type of reit at the wrong time</s>
<s>youll find reit fund and etf choices on our money 70 list of recommended funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one more thing reits do not typically pay corporate income taxes so their dividends dont usually qualify for the preferential 15 maximum tax rate for qualified dividends</s>
<s>rather reit dividends are for the most part taxed at ordinary income rates that currently can run as high as 35</s>
<s>so to the extent possible youll probably want to keep any reits you buy in a taxadvantaged account like a 401k or ira to minimize the tax hit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line reits can be a good choice if youre looking to add investments that can generate dividend yield and make your overall portfolio a bit less volatile</s>
<s>but they are not safe havens that can immunize you against losses</s>
