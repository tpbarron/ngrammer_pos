<s>money magazine  im a longterm investor but i worry that the financial issues facing spain and greece could send the us market into a significant slide</s>
<s>does it make sense to pull out of the market and leave my nest egg in cash until this is sorted out</s>

<p>
<s>moving to the sidelines in order to assess the impact of europes woes on the us market may seem like a reasonable strategy but its not</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you think about it theres almost always something that has the potential to send the market into a tailspin</s>
<s>last year it was worries about the us debt ceiling</s>
<s>a month ago it was a rising tide of investor distrust in the wake of facebooks fb screwedup ipo</s>
<s>last week it was moodys downgrading the credit ratings of 15 major banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today europes economic problems are taking center stage but there are plenty of other issues that could just as easily make the market swoon the looming fiscal cliff the us faces if tax increases and federal spending cuts take effect as scheduled next year the growing threat of an economic slowdown in china persistently lackluster job growth and high unemployment here at home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you start yanking money out of the market every time theres some potentially threatening economic news you could end up sitting in cash for a very long time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>besides youre kidding yourself if you think you can adequately protect your portfolio by fleeing the market when the economic outlook here or elsewhere darkens</s>
<s>even if the coast seems clear an unseen storm could be brewing somewhere</s>
<s>after all as stock prices climbed more than 24 from the beginning of 2006 through midjuly 2007 most investors felt pretty sanguine about the markets prospects</s>
<s>its not as if they saw the financial crisis coming and yanked their money out of stocks before the market tanked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all of which is to say that jumping into cash every time you get worried then moving back into stocks when you feel more optimistic isnt an investing strategy</s>
<s>its a guessing game you cant win</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre considering getting out of the market you not only have to decide whether or not to leave but when to go</s>
<s>and where to go</s>
<s>and when to get back in</s>
<s>your chances of getting all these calls right are pretty minimal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the time you sort through the possibilities market prices have probably already adjusted</s>
<s>the result is that you may not get as much protection on the downside as youd hoped by exiting</s>
<s>you may also miss out on a good portion of any rebound by the time you decide its safe to reinvest</s>
<s>and of course you run the risk of getting it totally wrong bailing out only to see the market hold up or jumping back in just before the market takes another dive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre really the longterm investor you say you are you need to develop a strategy that isnt based on emotion and guesswork</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>start by recognizing that your goal isnt to avoid market downturns</s>
<s>rather your aim should be to create a portfolio that not only has enough stock exposure to give your nest egg a decent shot at the growth it will need to support you in retirement but also enough in bonds and cash to keep the damage during market downturns to a magnitude you can tolerate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so instead of moving to cash i recommend you review how your nest egg is currently invested</s>
<s>the fact that youre so nervous now makes me wonder whether youve been investing more aggressively than you should</s>
<s>since the markets march 2009 low stocks have gained about 90</s>
<s>its not unusual during such runups for investors to get overconfident and overestimate their true appetite for risk</s>
<s>perhaps your jitters are a wakeup call</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for tips on how you might divvy up your nest egg between stocks bonds and cash you can check out our fix your mix tool</s>
<s>when youve decided a stocksbonds mix that seems appropriate you can plug that portfolio into morningstars asset allocator to get a sense of how it might perform over the longterm as well as during market corrections</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once youve settled on a basic blend of stocks and bonds  and i mean basic you dont want to overdo it  leave it alone except to rebalance periodically</s>
<s>as you approach retirement and become more concerned about conserving than growing capital youll also want to gradually shift more towards bonds and cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this strategy wont immunize you from shortterm losses altogether</s>
<s>nothing outside of sitting in an fdicinsured savings account can do that</s>
<s>but it should limit your setbacks to ones you can handle  and save you from having to obsess over what to do every time you see a scary headline</s>
