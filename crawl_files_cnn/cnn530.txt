<s>new york cnnmoney  im in desperate need of financial advice</s>
<s>my husband and i have two kids and earn more than $75000 a year</s>
<s>it seems like we should have enough money but we live paycheck to paycheck and sometimes overdraw our checking account</s>
<s>ive thought about going to a financial adviser for help</s>
<s>but since we dont have a big portfolio im not even sure an adviser would talk to us</s>
<s>are there any tricks to saving</s>
<s>how do i start a budget and stay on it</s>

<p>
<s>it would be nice if i could give you some magical incantation or secret budgeting tip to quickly and painlessly transform you into a diligent saver</s>
<s>but lets be real</s>
<s>we all know saving money boils down to one thing living on less than what you earn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for most of us this is easier said than done</s>
<s>in fact saving is an unnatural activity for humans</s>
<s>were hardwired for immediate gratification</s>
<s>we see a shiny new car we want a shiny new car</s>
<s>and we know that by spending or borrowing we get to enjoy it right now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>devoting money to our financial security or a retirement nest egg by contrast doesnt provide that instantaneous good feeling</s>
<s>small wonder that the psychoeconomic playing field is tilted more toward spending money than saving it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fortunately there are a few strategies that can help you overcome this natural bias toward spending and give you a shot at becoming an assiduous saver</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the technique that i think is most effective doesnt involve budgeting per se but arranging your financial life so that youll have a better chance of living on less than you make</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you do so by turning the tables on the whole budgeting paradigm and focusing not on the spending side of the equation but the savings side</s>
<s>specifically you set a savings target and make sure to hit that first</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the conventional budgeting approach would have you divide your spending into various categories  housing utilities entertainment etc</s>
<s> and then shave your expenditures a bit in each category</s>
<s>so rather than buying a latte and croissant each morning at starbucks sbux fortune 500 you might save a buck or so each day by having a coffee and boston kreme at dunkin donuts dnkn instead</s>
<s>or you might save even more by making breakfast at home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem with this method is that even if you manage to cut back in various areas theres no assurance the money youre no longer spending on croissants latenight pizza new clothes or whatever will find its way into savings</s>
<s>you may just end up spending it on something else</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you have a much better chance of actually getting money into a savings or retirement account by specifically earmarking a certain portion of your annual earnings for savings  say 10 or in your case $7500 this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to make sure that $7500 is actually saved you could enroll in your companys 401k plan and agree to contribute 10 of salary</s>
<s>each month $625 would go from your paycheck into your 401k before you even have a chance to get your mitts on it and before the government gets to tax it</s>
<s>if your employer doesnt have such a plan you could sign up for an automatic investing plan with a mutual fund company that will transfer whatever amount you stipulate from your checking account to your fund account each month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or for that matter you could split your savings between a retirement account and other savings</s>
<s>ideally you should start your savings effort by building an emergency fund equal to threetosix months worth of living expenses in a savings account moneymarket fund or cd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the point though is that by setting aside savings first youll little choice but to live on less than you earn</s>
<s>with $7500 siphoned off the top for savings youll no longer have $75000 before taxes to spend</s>
<s>youll have $67500 actually a bit more to the extent you contribute to a 401k as your contribution lowers your taxable income and your tax bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a practical matter this means that one way or another youll have to arrange your life to get by on your salary after savings</s>
<s>whether you do that by making a lot of small economies brown bagging it for lunch choosing a barebones cable tv package or one or two big ones owning a less expensive car or living in a more modest home or apartment doesnt much matter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the key is that you fit your lifestyle to the amount of money you have after youve set aside savings and of course that you dont subvert the whole process by funding extra spending with debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are other techniques that can also help you salt away some dough</s>
<s>as ive suggested before you can turn the urge to spend into an incentive to save</s>
<s>for example you might set a savings target  say $5000 for the year  and if you hit it give yourself a nice little reward at the end of the year a weekend getaway an electronic gadget whatever</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or if youre one of those people who respond better to penalties than rewards you can check out the stickk site</s>
<s>once there you create a commitment contract to achieve a certain goal say save $1000 within six months</s>
<s>fail to reach that goal and you must pay a penalty you set in advance  $100 $500 however much you choose  to whatever person or organization you designate</s>
<s>to increase the pain of failure and the incentive to succeed the person or organization that receives the dough if you fall short should be one you dont much care for</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and of course you can always go with the old standby budgeting whether its putting together a conventional budget or going with a variation like the bucket budget which many people find easier to create and follow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the way i really dont think you need an adviser to do any of this</s>
<s>but if you feel you wont follow through without some handholding you could always hire a financial planner on a flat fee or hourly basis to help you get started</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but whether you decide to go it alone or seek help i suggest you get moving now while the impulse to save is still strong</s>
<s>because the longer you live a lifestyle that doesnt include regular saving the harder it will be to changeÂ </s>
