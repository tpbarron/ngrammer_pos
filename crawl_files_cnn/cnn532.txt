<s>money magazine  im 25 years old and contribute enough to my 401k to take full advantage of my employers matching funds</s>
<s>but i can afford to save even more</s>
<s>my question should i just put more in my 401k or contribute to an ira</s>
<s> derek</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>clearly you always want to contribute enough to your 401k to get all the matching funds your employer is willing to kick in</s>
<s>otherwise youre giving away free money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but since youre already maxing out the match your next best step is to go with an ira specifically a roth ira</s>
<s>and if you move quickly you could sock away a healthy amount this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fund a roth ira account by the april 17 tax filing deadline and you can invest as much as $5000 and have it count as your contribution for the 2011 tax year</s>
<s>that would allow you to contribute up to $5000 for the 2012 tax year too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you decide to go the 401k route instead the extra contribution will count toward the 2012 tax year as you cant retroactively contribute money to a 401k</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contributing to the roth ira for 2011 rather than boosting the amount you put into your 401k you get a chance to put an extra years contribution into your retirement kitty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to make an annual roth ira contribution you must first meet the income eligibility criteria</s>
<s>but even if you earn too much to do a roth you can still fund a roth account in a roundabout way contribute to a nondeductible ira and then convert that account to a roth ira</s>
<s>before you try this end run however you should know that it involves a few wrinkles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why do i recommend you put money into the roth rather than continue to save without a match in your 401k or for that matter contribute to a traditional deductible ira which you could also do for the 2011 tax year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two reasons</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first although you dont get the same immediate taxbreak with a roth that you do with a 401k or traditional ira the roth allows you to withdraw money down the road without paying a cent in income taxes as long as you meet the requirements for taxfree withdrawals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the option of paying taxes on your contribution now is generally a better deal than getting a tax break today if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket when you withdraw the money  often the case if you contribute when youre young and in a lower tax bracket</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course forecasting the tax rate youll pay years from now is an iffy proposition at best</s>
<s>not only is it difficult to project what your taxable income may be decades ahead its even harder to predict the tax rates congress might set</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that leads me to the second reason a roth ira is a good idea if youre already saving in a 401k  namely contributing to a roth allows you to practice tax diversification</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the savings you accumulate in 401ks and traditional iras will eventually be taxed at ordinary income rates when you withdrawal a boost in tax rates during retirement could dramatically reduce the aftertax value of those savings</s>
<s>to the extent you keep some of your nest egg in a roth account you can protect yourself against the risk of higher rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>diversifying your tax exposure also gives you greater flexibility in managing your tax bill in retirement</s>
<s>if additional withdrawals from your 401k or ira are about to push you into a higher tax bracket in a given year you can take money from your roth account instead and avoid the higher levy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>roth iras offer other benefits</s>
<s>unlike a traditional ira youre not required to begin withdrawing money from your account after age 70 frac12</s>
<s>when you do pull money from a roth the withdrawals dont count in determining whether your social security benefits are taxable as it is with withdrawals from a traditional ira or 401k</s>
<s>and if you decide you dont need to spend the dough in your roth you can pass it along to your heirs income tax free</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is a downside to your plan of supplementing your 401k with a roth ira</s>
<s>and thats failing to follow through on it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you decide to increase your 401k contribution all youve got to do is notify your plan administrator or hr department</s>
<s>the extra dough will be deducted from your paycheck automatically assuring the money actually gets saved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a roth ira requires more of a commitment</s>
<s>youve got to set up an account with a mutual fund company or other investment firm and you must fund it</s>
<s>neither is difficult</s>
<s>in fact you can do the entire process online at many firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but with all the details that demand our attention in life this is a simple task we sometimes never get around to completing</s>
<s>next thing you know the deadline has passed and that extra savings didnt make it into a 401k or a roth ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if you agree with my reasoning about a roth ira i suggest you open and fund your account well within the april 17 deadline for a 2011 contribution</s>
<s>once youve done that you might as well get a head start for 2012 as well  provided youll also contribute enough to your 401k to get the maximum match</s>
