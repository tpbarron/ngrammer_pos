<s>new york cnnmoney  im thinking of stashing cash for emergencies into a treasury inflation protected securities tips mutual fund rather than cds or a moneymarket account</s>
<s>the return is better and the risk doesnt seem to be much higher</s>
<s>what do you think of this plan</s>
<s> ronnie colvin madison alabama</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with shortterm interest rates barely positive i understand why youre anxious to earn more on your cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the move youre considering can be dangerous as many investors have discovered after theyve snapped up everything from annuities and bank loan funds to auctionrate preferred securities and nonbank cds in search of higher returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>recently some people have toyed with the idea of switching out of lowyielding bonds and into dividendpaying stocks to grab extra yield</s>
<s>the problem is that the potentially higher yield or returns inevitably comes with more risk  even if the risk isnt readily apparent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and thats true for tips as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tips pay a real or inflationadjusted yield</s>
<s>between 2003 and 2011 the real yield for 10year tips averaged 17</s>
<s>if you bought tips at that average return and held until maturity you would be assured of getting a return of 17 percentage points a year above the inflation rate over the term of the bond</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but like the yield on regular bonds the real yield on tips also goes up and down based on how much investors are willing to pay</s>
<s>due to buying by individuals institutional investors and the federal reserve over the past year so much money has flowed into tips that their real yields have been driven down into negative territory although a negative tips yield doesnt necessarily translate to a negative return as inflation adjustments could ultimately push the return back into positive ground</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since bond prices and bond yields have a seesaw relationship  when one rises the other falls and vice versa  the decline in real yields has worked to the advantage of people who bought tips at earlier higher yields</s>
<s>over the past year morningstars inflationprotected bonds category has gained an impressive 14</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>based on returns like that its easy to assume tips are a safe harbor offering inflation protection and lofty returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but real yields can go up as well as down</s>
<s>and if they do  which many people consider likely given how low theyve sunk  the market value of tips will take a hit</s>
<s>over a twoweek period last august for example the real yield on 10year tips climbed from 013 to 025</s>
<s>during that period the value of the ishares barclays tips fund fell nearly 4</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tips with shorter maturities would likely hold their value better</s>
<s>the ishares barclays 05 year tips fund dropped by about half as much or 21 in august</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the point is the market value of tips can go up and down</s>
<s>and since their value can fluctuate they cant provide the principal protection you want for cash that you may need to tap in the shortterm</s>
<s>indeed gemma wrightcasparius comanager of vanguards inflationprotected securities fund told me investors should expect higherthannormal volatility from tips because their yields are so low</s>
<s>all else equal lower bond yields make for wider possible fluctuations in bond prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not to say tips cant play a role as a longterm inflationhedge within a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds thats rebalanced on a regular basis</s>
<s>granted tips inflation protection looks expensive at todays depressed real yields</s>
<s>but the return you earn ultimately depends on the future path of inflation</s>
<s>so if inflation goes high enough you could still end up doing better than in a regular treasury bond</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but whether you feel theyre a good buy for the longterm or not tips are definitely not substitutes for the cash portion of your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so by all means shop around for savings accounts money funds and cds that pay the highest yields in this lowyield environment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but for the money you absolutely positively need on a moments notice stick to secure options like fdicinsured savings or moneymarket accounts shortterm cds or moneymarket funds</s>
<s>and in the case of money funds youll also want to keep an eye on the securities and exchange commissions reform proposals which could affect the funds yields and liquidity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line scrap any plans for moving your cash reserves into tips</s>
