<s>the largest atlantic storm ever recorded is making its way through the heart of the east coasts oil refinery region</s>
<s>sandys fierce winds and unrelenting rain will be pounding major refineries in delaware new jersey and pennsylvania</s>
<s>many have already shut down temporarily</s>

<s>among those shut down is the regions second largest phillips 66s psx bayway refinery in linden nj which processes 238000 barrels of oil per day</s>
<s>refineries operated byhess hes fortune 500nustar ns fortune 500 and others have also shut down entirely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the real impact would come if damage from flying debris or power outages takes some refineries offline for several days</s>
<s>thats because the capacity of northeast oil refineries is much smaller than it used to be  they handle just under 1 million barrels of oil per day down from 16 million barrels per day in 2007</s>

<s>refineries in the area were built to process light sweet crude oil but in recent years that kind of oil has been replaced by heavier sour crude oil which costs more to refine</s>
<s>the plants have become less profitable and many have shut down</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>still many unknowns remain because this is the first real test of the region since the big decline in refining capacity</s>
<s>unlike last years hurricane irene which stayed just east of the refinery region hurricane sandy is expected to tear right through it</s>

<s>the northeast is now more reliant upon pipelines from the gulf coast and ships traveling through the atlantic ocean</s>
<s>and ships cant make their way through the atlantic yet because the storm is so large</s>
