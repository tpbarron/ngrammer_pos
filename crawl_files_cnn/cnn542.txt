<s>money magazine  im 40 and have more than twice my current salary saved</s>
<s>if i contribute the $17000 maximum this year to my 401k and continue to do the max each year and make catchup contributions starting at age 50 will i have enough money during retirement</s>
<s> stan a</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fact that youve squirreled away so much and plan to continue saving at such a prodigious pace certainly suggests that youre on track toward a comfortable retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but despite that optimistic outlook i cant say  nor should you assume  that your future retirement security is a done deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>attaining a secure retirement isnt just a matter of having a specific amount tucked away by a given age saving a certain amount each year or earning a particular rate of return</s>
<s>theres also the issue of how much youll earn during your career all else equal the more you earn the less of your preretirement income social security will replace so the higher percentage of salary you must save how much of your preretirement salary you think youll need to live comfortably once you retire and how big a cushion you want to assure that you dont run out of dough</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its hard to know how all these factors will play out especially when retirement is still more than two decades away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in his book your money ratios financial planner charlie farrell tries to do just that</s>
<s>he estimates the multiple of salary one should have tucked away in retirement accounts by different ages in order to have a shot at a secure retirement</s>
<s>a 40yearold for example should have about two times their salary already saved</s>
<s>based on that metric it would appear youre in good shape</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem is you cant rely on that metric alone</s>
<s>in fact that twicesalary guideline has a host of other assumptions behind it</s>
<s>one is that youll continue to save 10 of salary a year until age 45 and then bump it up to 13 annually</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre socking away $17000 a year you should have no trouble meeting or exceeding that 10ofsalary savings hurdle as long as you earn $170000 a year or less</s>
<s>but if you earn more than that  or have to save a higher percentage later on as is the case using farrells savings guideline  youll have to sock away more than $17000 to hit the 10 target</s>
<s>that would mean saving outside your 401k say in an ira or taxable accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>farrells savingstoincome ratios also assume your retirement investments will grow at a 45 annual real rate or a return of 45 percentage points above inflation each year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for a very longterm estimate that seems reasonable enough</s>
<s>but its just an estimate not a guarantee</s>
<s>your investments could do better or worse depending on how prudently you invest and how the markets fare</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>oh and the savings figures ive mentioned so far also assume you want to retire at age 65 on 70 of preretirement salary</s>
<s>if you want a cushier retirement youll need a bigger savings stash and will need to sock away a higher percentage of your income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to retire at 65 on 80 of salary for example farrell estimates you would need to have 24 times salary saved by age 40 plus you would have to save 12 a year until age 45 and then bump it up to 15</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but theres another reason its hard to know for sure whether youll have enough for your future retirement</s>
<s>even though you may have every intention of saving the 401k max every year and doing the full catchup contribution $5500 this year when you hit 50 forces beyond your control could prevent you from pulling it off</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just look back to 2008 when a deep recession massive layoffs and a 50plus decline in stock prices disrupted many peoples welllaid retirement plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so my advice is to use a tool like t rowe prices retirement income calculator and plug in your actual financial information the actual amount you have saved how much you earn how your money is invested</s>
<s>by doing so youll get a good sense of the probability youll be prepared for retirement assuming youre able to follow through with your savings regimen</s>
<s>if your odds of success arent as high as youd like you can make adjustments such as saving more retiring later or investing differently</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>realistically though a retirement plan isnt something you can set and then leave on autopilot</s>
<s>so youll want to repeat this exercise every year or so to assure youre continuing to make progress and if not finetune your plan</s>
<s>even after youve retired youll want to check in at least annually to make sure that youre not running through your assets too quickly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the rate youre going chances are youll do just fine</s>
<s>but a lot can happen between now and the time youll actually retire</s>
<s>better to tweak your plan along the way if necessary than to assume youre on track and find out late in the game that youve been overconfident all along</s>
