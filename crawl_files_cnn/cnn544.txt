<s>improvements to the job market remain frustratingly slow federal reserve chairman ben bernanke told senators tuesday repeating the same language he used a year ago</s>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  federal reserve chairman ben bernanke gave senators a rather gloomy outlook for the economy tuesday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>europes debt crisis and fiscal cliff in the united states are threatening the recovery he told the senate banking committee in his semiannual report to congress</s>
<s>meanwhile economic growth has probably already slowed and the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall below 7 for at least another year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>congress needs to act now to support the economy he urged</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but instead of focusing on how to put americans back to work many senators decided to slam bernanke on the recent libor scandal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the very first question of the hearing was from senator tim johnson</s>
<s>can you tell the american people what did you know when did you know it and what did you do about it johnson said referring to the scandal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke defended the new york fed which he said investigated the issue and made recommendations</s>
<s>but ultimately british banking officials are responsible for overseeing libor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the testimony is supposed to focus on monetary policy</s>
<s>how will the fed solve persistently high unemployment</s>
<s>what is the outlook from here</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke gave few hints about how the fed will act going forward but reiterated that he stands ready to act should the economy need an extra boost</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>weve looked at a range of possible tools bernanke said</s>
<s>we are looking for ways to address the weakness in the economy should more action be needed to promote a sustained recovery in the labor market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he cited many possibilities for stimulus but noted that all have risks</s>
<s>the fed could buy more treasuries or mortgagebacked securities for example in a policy popularly known as quantitative easing</s>
<s>that policy is meant to push interest rates even lower than their current historic lows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>other options could include communicating the feds future plans more thoroughly to the public or cutting the interest rate the fed pays on excess reserves</s>
<s>the fed currently offers banks a 025 rate to keep their extra cash at the central bank</s>
<s>lowering that rate could get them to put those funds to another use somewhere else in the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wall street has been hoping for additional stimulus from the federal reserve and stocks turned lower as bernanke spoke</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke said improvement in the job market is likely to remain frustratingly slow the same phrase he used a year ago to describe the economy</s>
<s>the feds forecast predicts the unemployment rate will still be stuck above 7 or higher at the end of 2014</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke also noted concerns about economic growth saying that after a 25 gain in gross domestic product for the second half of 2011 growth slowed to less than 2 in the first quarter of 2012 and he pointed to a still smaller gain in the second quarter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>independent economists have been slashing their forecasts for economic growth recently given weak hiring foreign trade and retail sales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us economy has continued to recover but economic activity appears to have slowed somewhat during the first half of this year bernanke said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the fed chairman had better news on inflation saying that the lower price of oil has brought inflation down to a manageable level</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke was mildly positive about the housing sector saying that new and existing housing sales have been gradually trending upward since last summer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but he noted the large number of vacant homes remains still elevated lending standards are tight and a significant number of households are still underwater on their mortgages  meaning they owe more than their houses are worth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke said the most effective way congress could help support the economy right now would be to address the nations fiscal challenges in a way that wont harm the recovery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in no way am i saying that we shouldnt be making strong efforts to achieve longterm sustainability bernanke said</s>
<s>it would be better to make that plan soon but to have the effects come in more gradually to allow the recovery the air it needs in the shortterm</s>
