<s>choosing between a regular and a roth 401k isnt exactly an applestoapples comparison but you can simplify the decision</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  roth 401ks used to be fairly rare but theyre starting to crop up by the bushelful</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two in five privatesector plans offer these taxadvantaged retirement accounts with another 29 likely to add them this year according to aon hewitt</s>
<s>and the federal government began offering roths to 33 million of its employees in may</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet workers have been slow to bite</s>
<s>only 6 of savers who are eligible have signed up</s>
<s>part of that is employees are already in traditional 401ks and dont have the time or capacity to make a decision to change says charlotte nc financial planner william bissett</s>
<s>theres also the extra cost involved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just as with a roth ira roth 401ks are funded with aftertax dollars while withdrawals are taxfree</s>
<s>the upfront tax hit though means stuffing $17000  the annual federal max for all 401k accounts combined if youre under 50  will actually take $23610 if youre in the 28 federal bracket</s>

<p>
<s>clearly a roth isnt for everyone</s>
<s>to see if youd benefit ask yourself the following questions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>am i sure ill be in a higher bracket later</s>
<s>because workers whod gain are those in a lower bracket now when taxes are paid than at retirement roths are especially attractive to young savers says t rowe price financial planner stuart ritter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related seniors think twice before you buy an annuity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the table shows a 30yearold at the 25 marginal rate today who retires in a higher bracket could generate 15 more retirement income by going with a roth</s>
<s>in fact that same person would do better with a roth 401k even if he retires at the same 25 tax rate</s>
<s>chalk it up to the longterm impact of taxfree compounding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>others who stand to benefit are high earners in the top brackets who plan to maintain that level of income in retirement</s>
<s>if you fall into either of these groups read on</s>
<s>if not skip to the last question</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>have i weighed other complicating factors</s>
<s>even if you think your tax rate will be higher later on insert snarky comment about washington pols itching to raise your taxes here a roth might still not be a slam dunk</s>
<s>what if you work in a hightax state like new york but plan to retire to incometaxfree florida or nevada</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also understand its your effective tax rate that matters at retirement not your marginal bracket</s>
<s>say youre single putting away 10 of your $80000 pay and are planning to tap $40000 a year in retirement</s>
<s>in a roth 401k your $8000 contribution will be taxed at your 25 rate</s>
<s>this may not seem that bad if you expect to be in the same bracket later on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but in a progressive tax system not every dime of income you generate later on will be taxed at your marginal rate</s>
<s>in this case the first $8700 will be taxed at 10 the next $26650 at 15 and the final $4650 will be hit with 25 for an effective rate of 151</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>will the roth negatively affect other taxes</s>
<s>contributing to a traditional 401k will reduce your adjusted gross income which in turn could lower the chances of being hit with the dreaded alternative minimum tax</s>
<s>roth contributions wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fail to reduce your agi and you may also lose tax credits and the deductibility of certain expenses says eric lewis a planner in los altos calif medical deductions for instance are limited only to those expenses that exceed 75 of your agi</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>are there special circumstances that weigh in the roths favor</s>
<s>roths appeal to those who want to pass money on to heirs since there are no required minimum distributions starting at 70Â½ if you roll the account into a roth ira</s>

<s>related boost retirement income minimize risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre attractive to highincome households for another reason</s>
<s>married couples filing jointly begin to lose the ability to fully fund a roth ira once their income exceeds $173000</s>
<s>yet these iras can help diversify the tax treatment of your retirement funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>earn too much for a roth ira</s>
<s>you can get the same diversification via a roth 401k says bissett</s>
<s>ideally he says you want different buckets to pull money from in the future as youre taking distributions</s>
