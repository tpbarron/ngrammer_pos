<s>money magazine  if you have a child headed off to college this fall youve got an important item on your todo list the free application for federal student aid fafsa which you can submit as early as jan 1</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the number filed for the past year was up 11 to a record 21 million while the budget for federal aid increased by only 7 and funding shrank in many states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this year the competition could be even stiffer</s>
<s>so know these things before you file</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>contrary to popular belief theres no advantage to filing on jan 1 says kal chany author of paying for college without going broke</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while early birds do generally get bigger helpings colleges dont begin reviewing aid applications until after their priority filing deadlines  typically feb 15 for private schools march 1 for public</s>
<s>most states start march 1 or after</s>
<s>illinois kentucky oregon south carolina and tennessee are the exceptions in those states aid is first come first served so shoot for early january</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>everywhere else aim to file by the school priority deadlines and use the extra time to do your 2011 taxes</s>
<s>estimating those for the fafsa can backfire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example your yearend pay stub may not account for 401k contributions causing you to overstate your adjusted gross income</s>
<s>and every $10000 you add can reduce aid by $4000 according to finaidorg</s>
<s>while youll eventually have to follow up with your 1040 by the time any mistake is corrected you may have missed out on some aid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a third of families with collegebound students dont submit fafsas and nearly half of them say they didnt think they were eligible for aid reports lender sallie mae</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but almost every family qualifies for some form of assistance says haley chitty of the national association of student financial aid administrators</s>
<s>for example you must fill out the fafsa to access lowinterest federal loans  like the stafford which anyone can get</s>
<s>as of last fall you must also file for parental plus loans</s>
<s>some schools require the fafsa for merit awards as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the amount and type of aid you receive is based in part on your assets  excluding retirement  some experts recommend spending down cash before filing</s>
<s>but the federal formula assesses parental assets at 565 so using up $1000 of savings cuts your expected family contribution by only $57</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anyway $35000 to $60000 of your assets are sheltered depending on the age of the older parent</s>
<s>a students assets however are levied at 20</s>
<s>so better to spend your kids cash or move it to your name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine is researching an article on ways to reduce the financial pain of college</s>
