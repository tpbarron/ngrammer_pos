<s>new york cnnmoney  my granddaughter has asked me how to invest the money shell contribute to her employers retirement savings plan at her first job</s>
<s>i suggested she either go with a 2050 targetretirement fund or divide her money as follows 40 in an sp 500 index fund 40 in a smallcap index fund and 20 in an international stock index fund</s>
<s>do you think she should go with the first option the second or do something else</s>

<p>
<s>kudos for recommending that your granddaughter take a diversified investment approach via a targetdate fund or by spreading her money among more than one asset class herself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i prefer your first recommendation  the targetdate fund  over the second</s>
<s>the targetdate fund is an excellent choice for almost anyone just starting out in his or her career</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the appealing feature of targetdate funds is their simplicity</s>
<s>you choose a fund with a date that roughly corresponds to the year youll retire  2050 2060 whatever  and you get everything you need rolled into one fund  domestic stocks international shares a diversified portfolio of bonds</s>
<s>they are nice for newbie investors or anyone who lacks the time skill or inclination to build and monitor a retirement portfolio on his or her own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while not all targetdate funds provide those key ingredients in the same proportion generally the portfolios have reasonable allocations</s>
<s>most 2050 funds for example would have about 90 of their asset in stocks with roughly 30 or so of that stake in foreign shares and the rest in a diversified group of bonds</s>
<s>over time that mix automatically becomes more conservative shifting toward bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>targetdate funds arent perfect</s>
<s>some may have bloated fees</s>
<s>and some can be much more aggressive than others although thats more of a risk closer to or during retirement</s>
<s>in any case dont invest and then completely forget about these target date funds</s>
<s>check their performance from time to time and make sure youre comfortable with them especially during market downturns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your second option  having your granddaughter create her own portfolio is also acceptable</s>
<s>she would just have to devote more time and effort to her investing by choosing funds deciding how to divvy up her assets among different asset classes and rebalancing occasionally</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i would however recommend a few changes to the allocations you suggest</s>
<s>your mix has her 100 invested in stocks</s>
<s>to be on the safe side id recommend having a small slug of bonds at least 10 or so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of allocating half of her domestic stock portfolio to volatile smallcap stocks id recommend sticking closer to the market weighting for small and midcap stocks</s>
<s>combined these stocks make up about 30 or so of the overall us stock market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the easiest way to do that would be to create a portfolio much like that of the typical 2050 targetdate fund</s>
<s>of course if shes going to do that then why not just stick with the 2050 fund itself</s>
<s>it would be easier cleaner and less prone to mistakes like failing to rebalance periodically</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one final note once shes settled on an investment strategy tell her to contribute as much as she can afford to her plan and certainly at least enough to take full advantage of any employer match</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even though we tend to pay much more attention to the investing side of the retirement planning diligent saving is the real engine for creating retirement wealth</s>
