<s>money magazine  i saw a website that claims i can lower my taxes by declaring my blog as a business for tax purposes</s>
<s>is this really possible</s>
<s> ak los angeles calif</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure its possible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if youre planning to slash your tax bill by taking big deductions for costs you attribute to your blog youll want to be sure you can make a solid case for it before you file your taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>otherwise you could find yourself in hot water with the irs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres the deal if you run your blog or for that matter any other activity as a profitmaking venture youre entitled to deduct what the irs calls ordinary and necessary business expenses from the income your blog generates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those expenses could include the fees you pay to set up and maintain your blog research and administrative costs the expenses involved in operating an office in or outside your home  even depreciation of electronic equipment and travel as long as they have a bona fide business purpose</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example if advertising on your blog produced $5000 of revenue last year and your business expenses totaled $2000 you would show $3000 of taxable income from your blog most likely by filing irs form schedule c you would then report that $3000 of taxable income along with any other income on irs form 1040</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in that case your blog would boost your taxable income although you could reduce the tax hit from that extra income by contributing to a taxdeferred savings plan designed for the selfemployed such as a sepira or an ira if you qualify</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>things get tricky if your expenses exceed the income from your blog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets say that you report $5000 of income and $25000 in expenses for a loss of $20000</s>
<s>if you also had say $70000 of income from a job your $20000 loss would reduce your reported income to $50000</s>
<s>assuming a 25 marginal tax rate that loss would shave $5000 from your federal tax bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while that may be sweet from your point of view the irs might wonder whether youre actually just trying to game the tax system by taking deductions for what is really a hobby rather than a business</s>
<s>which means that if you expect to report losses from your blog and use those losses to lower your taxes youd better be prepared to demonstrate your blog is a business and not a hobby</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how can you do that</s>
<s>one way is to meet the profit or three of five test</s>
<s> the irs presumes that an activity is carried on for profit it if makes a profit during at least three of the last five tax years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>failing that test doesnt automatically relegate your blog to hobby status</s>
<s>the irs also considers other factors such as whether you depend on income from the activity have the expertise to run the venture and are putting in the effort to make the business successful</s>
<s>you can also bolster your case if you operate in a businesslike manner keeping good books and records and looking for ways to improve profitability</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>essentially this is a judgment call</s>
<s>the more often you make a profit and the more you run your blog like a real business the more likely the irs will recognize it as one</s>
<s>if youre always racking up losses and operate in a helterskelter way youll have a harder time making a case</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you file your taxes on the assumption that your blog is a business and the irs ends up declaring it a hobby you can still deduct the expenses you incur for your blog</s>
<s>but you can deduct them only up to the amount of income the blog generates  and doing even that may be difficult because certain expenses can be written off only to the extent they exceed 2 of your adjusted gross income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in short those limits would rule out using a loss from your blog to lower the tax bill on your other income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one final note even if you do establish your blog as a business you should know that the irs is also aware that some people like to shift personal expenses to their businesses to reduce their tax tab</s>
<s>and the irs doesnt hesitate to audit people it suspects of crossing that line</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if youre thinking about deducting that $10000 hometheater system you had installed in your family room last year on the theory that hd and surround sound are crucial to your ability to blog about the presidential election campaign id reconsider</s>
