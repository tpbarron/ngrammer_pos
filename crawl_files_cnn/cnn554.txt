<p>
<s>it doesnt have to be this way</s>
<s>there are ways to halt the tuition spiral evidenced by innovative programs already working at dozens of colleges across the country</s>
<s>if enough of them were widely embraced college would certainly become more affordable</s>
<s>tools are also being developed to help you assess whether a particular school is worth its high price tag</s>

<p>
<s>innovative ideas to tame tuition hikes are springing up in highered circles</s>

<p>
<s>refocus on academics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the 10 years that ended in 2009 spending by large public universities on instruction rose about 10 in real terms reports the delta cost project a nonprofit that analyzes college expenses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile spending on student services jumped 19 and outlays for operations shot up 20 as the bills for everything from maintaining lavish dorms and spalike gyms to salaries for the legions of administrators it takes to run large universities these days took their toll</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>colleges dont have to cut into academic programs though to keep rising costs in check as shown by a report last year from mckinsey on highly efficient colleges</s>
<s>among the easiertoimplement ideas shifting some services online and outsourcing dining and it</s>
<s>many of the practices actually improve the educational experience for students</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a mentoring program at southern new hampshire university in manchester for example keeps costs per student low by helping ensure students are not wasting money on unnecessary credits</s>
<s>and a shift to a yearround calendar at brigham young university in idaho has led to a 32 drop in costs per student with extra tuition revenue more than offsetting a rise in faculty costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a bigger bolder move to hold down costs boost the number of hours professors teach</s>
<s>using data from the university of texas at austin richard vedder head of the nonprofit center for college affordability and productivity concluded that the average public research university could reduce its faculty size at least 25 by requiring professors to teach one or two more classes a year</s>
<s>while some faculty argue that heavier teaching loads would impede research  and could spur some teachers to flee to private colleges  vedders data show that many ut professors successfully juggle large teaching loads and research</s>

<s>then theres the ultimate sacred cow college sports</s>
<s>spending on athletics has accelerated at twice the pace of spending on academics according to the knight commission on intercollegiate athletics even though most programs lose money</s>
<s>of the top 120 division i football teams for example only 22 showed a profit last year</s>
<s>defenders say those programs are still valuable because they can lead to a spike in admissions applications and alumni donations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet research on the impact of championship teams finds mixed results at best</s>

<p>
<s>prospects for success</s>
<s>financial turmoil is finally forcing most colleges to take cost cutting seriously says jane wellman executive director of the delta cost project</s>
<s>many state schools in particular however are seeking quick cuts by dropping programs or consolidating departments</s>
<s>theres no widespread move for the broader reforms outlined by mckinsey and vedder</s>
<s>one encouraging sign the pace of athletic spending at least seems to be slowing</s>
<s>among the top 120 programs median expenses rose less than 2 last year vs about 11 in 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>leverage technology</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>high technology  long an expense blamed for fueling tuition hikes  is starting to pay off in big efficiencies as colleges use sophisticated software to slash electricity and phone costs</s>
<s>students are seeing direct benefits too</s>
<s>several hundred professors around the country are ditching traditional textbooks in favor of free opensource etextbooks or lowcost printondemand books that cost hundreds of dollars less a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the best cases costsaving technology also helps students learn better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>case in point more than 300 schools from public flagships like the university of alabama to private colleges such as depaul are lowering costs by reducing the number of traditional lectures and replacing them with mandatory skill drills at tutorstaffed computer labs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the national center for academic transformation reports math courses that blend teaching software and personal interaction with faculty cost about 30 less per student than traditional courses while improving pass rates</s>
<s>you only learn math by doing it not by watching it being done says ray purdom who runs a learning center at the university of north carolina at greensboro</s>
<s>similar results have been shown for science language and psychology classes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>prospects for success</s>
<s>skeptics worry about replacing teachers with computers partly because some research shows higher failure rates in online courses</s>
<s>fully online classes however are very different from the blended approach advocated by educators like william powell associate provost of the university of southern mississippi which redesigned several courses as techlecture combinations and watched costs go down and grades up as a result</s>
<s>sometimes you have to be slapped in the face by innovative ideas he says</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>families invest huge sums in a college education for their children without access to key information how well do students really learn at a given school</s>
<s>do graduates land good jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>colleges have long kept the relevant data secret or simply didnt track it</s>
<s>better information would help families decide whether a particular college is worth the price</s>
<s>parents want to know they arent wasting their money says julie morgan a policy analyst for the center for american progress a think tank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pressure from parents and government officials is finally beginning to yield better data</s>
<s>more than 500 schools have used the collegiate learning assessment a test of student gains in reasoning and critical thinking 1400 have participated in the national survey of student engagement which gathers data on students academic experiences</s>
<s>of those about 500 have gone public with results</s>
<s>starting next year data for more than 300 fouryear public colleges will be posted at the web site for college portrait for undergraduate education</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its even tougher to find out how many graduates land jobs and how much they earn</s>
<s>starting next june however forprofit colleges and some vocational programs will be required to report data on graduate debt burdens and jobs</s>

<p>

<p>
<s>prospects for success</s>
<s>many colleges will continue to resist revealing outcomes since the numbers may suggest they arent worth $40000 a year</s>
<s>in academically adrift authors richard arum and josipa roksa analyzed data for more than 1600 students and found that 36 failed to show significant improvement in learning over four years of college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet schools will eventually be pushed into greater disclosure says jamie merisotis head of the lumina foundation</s>
<s>in fact you can already find some job and income data for individual colleges at payscalecom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>work first pay later</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since many families cant afford to shell out tuition upfront and a college degree generally leads to highersalaried jobs why not let students pay for their ba after they graduate with their now bigger earnings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the idea of taxing a graduates income to pay for college promoted in 1955 by nobel laureate milton friedman was adopted by australia in 1989</s>
<s>students cover as much or little of their college bill as they want while in school once they graduate the government subtracts a surtax from their paychecks until the rest is paid off</s>
<s>result the number of australian college graduates has risen sharply</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>limited versions of payment plans linked to future earnings are springing up here too</s>
<s>in 2009 the federal government introduced a loanrepayment option that caps payments at 10 of disposable income the standard option keeps the amount you pay per month level no matter what your salary is</s>

<s>tuition deferment plans have had a bad rep with us colleges ever since the 1970s after a yale experiment with one failed when some grads didnt pay in full</s>
<s>the irs isnt keen on administering a graduate tax either</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even boosters such as collins acknowledge that colleges need dollars upfront to run their operations</s>
<s>he suggests phasing in these plans as one payment option colleges would collect tuition from some students right away while waiting for the longterm investments to pay off</s>
