<s>new york cnnmoney  i manage my own portfolio</s>
<s>do i need to use modern portfolio theory to allocate my assets</s>
<s>or will my gut feel for the riskreturn of each asset do</s>

<p>
<s>unless your stomach is so finely tuned that it can not only gauge the risk and return of stocks bonds and other assets but how those assets interact to determine your portfolios overall performance id forget about the gutfeel approach</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time though you dont want to put too much faith in modern portfolio theory or mpt as its affectionately known</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>typically investment advisers who use mpt rely on optimizer software to help them create a portfolio from a variety of investments  stocks bonds real estate commodities whatever</s>
<s>they plug in each assets expected return volatility and correlation to all the others and the program calculates exactly how much of each asset you should put in your portfolio so that theoretically at least youll get the highest possible return for whatever level of risk youre willing to accept</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but what works fine in theory doesnt always turn out so well in the real world</s>
<s>investors armed with optimizers can often create extreme portfolios that may generate underwhelming results</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reason is that while the basic info you plug into an optimizer seems simple  an assets expected return how much it jumps around and how it behaves relative to other assets is anything but certain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we can calculate those figures for the past</s>
<s>but we dont know what theyll be in the future</s>
<s>if investments perform differently in the future than they did in the past  even by a small amount  the portfolio that was so finely crafted using mpt can perform abysmally much as a racecar designed for the indy 500 would if it raced on a dirt track</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i recommend a hybrid approach a mixture of toneddown portfolio theory and common sense that can reap some of the benefits of mpt without overdoing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to get a handle on the quantitative aspects of creating a portfolio of different types of stocks bonds and funds you can go to a tool like morningstars asset allocator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as you drag the tools sliders to create different combinations of assets you can see the expected return for each portfolio as well as its volatility</s>
<s>by trying different asset combos you can home in on a riskreward combo that feels right for you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or if you want a simpler approach you can just go to our asset allocation tool answer a couple of questions and youll get a pie chart with a recommended mix of stock and bond funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now for the common sense part of this approach</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whatever portfolio you eventually settle on realize that its not going to perform exactly as you might hope</s>
<s>financial markets are uncertain and no theory investment strategy or combination of assets can eliminate that uncertainty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so id be wary about creating a portfolio thats highly risky or excessively conservative</s>
<s>you want to avoid a mix of assets thats so aggressive youll end up abandoning it if the market tanks</s>
<s>similarly you dont want to veer so much to the safety end of the spectrum that you relegate yourself to anemic returns over the long term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>id also caution against getting too fancy</s>
<s>some investors feel that to have a welldiversified portfolio theyve got to have exposure to every type of fund or etf out there not to mention hedge funds precious metals and other commodities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>simple is better</s>
<s>you can get by perfectly well with a combo of broadly diversified us stock and bond funds with perhaps a dash of foreign stock funds thrown in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre intent on also adding a small dollop of real estate funds or even a tiny bit of exposure to commodities fine</s>
<s>but be careful</s>
<s>as investment adviser and stop the investing ripoff author dave loeper points out in fake diversification its a mistake to assume complicated portfolios perform better</s>
<s>he also warns that advisors who recommend them may be doing so to justify lofty fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i cant promise that this hybrid mptcommon sense strategy will lead to superior performance</s>
<s>but if you settle on a portfolio thats diversified but not overly so and reflects your true tolerance for risk  and you periodically rebalance  youll have invested your money in a rational and sensible way</s>
