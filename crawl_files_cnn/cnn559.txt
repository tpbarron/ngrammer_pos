<s>during the nearly 30 years ive been at money dollarcost averaging  or moving the same amount of money from cash to stocks and bonds each month over the course of a year or more  has been largely accepted by market pros and individual savers alike as an ideal way to invest</s>
<s>you dont know when the market will sink or soar the rationale goes so youre better off tiptoeing in than taking the plunge</s>
<s>dollarcost averaging has achieved the status of investing truth with a capital t</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the only problem is that for even longer economists have known that this is an inefficient way to buy stocks and bonds going directly to your ideal asset allocation is more likely to generate a higher return for any given level of risk than moving to that mix gradually</s>
<s>dollarcost averaging it turns out is more of a psychological crutch than a shrewd investing strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because stocks and bonds usually outperform cash chances are youll earn more by getting into the market as quickly as possible</s>
<s>but thats not dollarcost averagings biggest shortcoming</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as an investor you need to think about your goals your time horizon and risk</s>
<s>the best way to address all three factors is to settle on a stock and bond mix that has a realistic shot of delivering reasonable longterm returns with a level of volatility that you can accept  and then rebalance periodically</s>
<s>generally the more time you have and the more comfortable you are dealing with market downturns the more you should allocate to stocks</s>
<s>to arrive at a blend use a tool like morningstars asset allocator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets say you have $120000 in cash and decide on a mix of 60 stocks and 40 bonds</s>
<s>how do you get to that allocation</s>
<s>you could immediately stash $72000 into a diversified group of stocks and $48000 into a broad range of bonds</s>
<s>or you could shift $10000 a month $6000 into stocks $4000 into bonds over a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you go that second route think about what youre actually doing</s>
<s>after deciding on a 6040 blend youll need more than a year to reach that goal</s>
<s>as the table below shows what youre really doing during that time is going through a series of allocations that are too conservative</s>
<s>by dollarcost averaging youre undermining the assetallocation strategy you settled on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ah but what if stock and bond prices fall during those 12 months</s>
<s>wouldnt you come out ahead if you had averaged in</s>
<s>yes you probably would</s>
<s>the opposite is true however if stocks and bonds had done well throughout the year</s>
<s>the point is you never know what the markets will do</s>
<s>that uncertainty is why you set an asset allocation in the first place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres another way to think about it if dollarcost averaging is so great why stop doing it once youre fully invested</s>
<s>the threat of sudden downturns will still be there</s>
<s>so why not liquidate your portfolio and dollarcostaverage back into stocks and bonds all over again</s>
<s>and then do it again and again</s>
<s>clearly such a strategy is absurd</s>
<s>yet investing gradually instead of committing to your target portfolio all at once amounts to the same thing</s>

<p>
<s>does investing small sums over time ever make sense</s>
<s>sure we do it all the time by directing payroll deductions into our 401ks thats because as a practical matter we cant make a big contribution all at once</s>
<s>when you have the money upfront its smarter not to delay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said dollarcost averaging could be a valid option if you find it too psychologically or emotionally difficult to jump into the market all at once</s>
<s>of course the real problem might be that your target allocation is too aggressive</s>
<s> but then you should try to limit the damage by averaging in over a few weeks or months instead of a year or more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact even though chris jones chief investment officer of the 401k advice firm financial engines believes that dollarcost averaging is essentially an inferior strategy his firm typically transitions clients into their recommended portfolio allocations over two or three months</s>
<s>notes jones weve learned thats what makes people most comfortable</s>
