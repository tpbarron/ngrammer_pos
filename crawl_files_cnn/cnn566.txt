<s>william bernstein investment adviser and author says the worst mistake is not knowing when to take money off the table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york money magazine  william bernstein has a gift not only for grasping the complex but for helping the rest of us get it too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he spent the first chunk of his career as a neurologist practicing on the coast of oregon but cut back on his work hours in 1990</s>
<s>a few years later he focused on a new fascination investing</s>
<s>he launched an online journal a sort of protoblog called efficientfrontiercom and wrote the intelligent asset allocator the first of several books</s>
<s>he has also written for money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now hes an investment adviser for a handful of highnetworth clients</s>
<s>bernsteins writing often explores academic financial theory but he manages to turn it into practical plainenglish advice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his latest obsession resulting in the short ebook the ages of the investor is what economists call the lifecycle theory which dictates that your asset allocation should be tied to your earnings power throughout your career</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernstein 64 spoke with senior editor george mannes their conversation was edited</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres a debate going on now among economists about how much exposure people should have to stocks</s>
<s>what made you weigh in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its almost like a political issue</s>
<s>theres a right wing of very smart authoritative people who think that savers and retirees should be investing conservatively because stocks are so risky</s>
<s>and then theres a left wing of equally smart and authoritative people who believe the opposite</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i was trying to reconcile the two views</s>
<s>plus i wanted to deal with what happened in the 2008 financial crisis which changed how people myself included think about risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a lot of people had won the game before the crisis happened they had pretty much saved enough for retirement and they were continuing to take risk by investing in equities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>afterward many of them sold either at or near the bottom and never bought back into it</s>
<s>and those people have irretrievably damaged themselves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i began to understand this point 10 or 15 years ago but now im convinced when youve won the game why keep playing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how risky stocks are to a given investor depends upon which part of the life cycle he or she is in</s>
<s>for a younger investor stocks arent as risky as they seem</s>
<s>for the middleaged theyre pretty risky</s>
<s>and for a retired person they can be nuclearlevel toxic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but at retirement you could be investing for several more decades</s>
<s>dont you have time to make up for shortterm losses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the end of your career you have no more earnings capacity left beyond social security or a pension</s>
<s>you have less of what lifecycle theory calls human capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if you have a long series of bad returns plus youre withdrawing 4 or 5 of your portfolio to live on it then in 10 to 12 years you may not have anything left</s>
<s>withdrawals during the distribution phase combined with a bad bear market can completely destroy a retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so how should i be investing near and after retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you want to end up with a portfolio that matches your liabilities meaning the amount youll need to spend in retirement</s>
<s>the rule of thumb i came up with based on annuity payouts and spending patterns late in life is that you should save 20 to 25 times your residual living expenses  that is the yearly shortfall you have to make up after social security and any pension</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this portfolio should be in safe assets treasury inflationprotected securities annuities or even shortterm bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anything above that you can invest in risky assets</s>
<s>thats your risk portfolio</s>
<s>if you dream about taking an aroundtheworld trip and the risk portfolio does well you can use it for that</s>
<s>if the risk portfolio doesnt do well at least youre not pushing a shopping cart under an overpass</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what if you are nearing retirement age and you dont have that 20 to 25 years saved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you should be working until you get that number</s>
<s>if youre 65 and youve only got half of your living expenses saved you can retire and you may skate through</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related its time to rethink retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you may die early or you may have a good market</s>
<s>but theres a significant chance youre going to be eating alpo when youre 85</s>
<s>thats the risk youre taking</s>
<s>the other choice you have is to work a few more years and reduce expenses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one thing that we point out to our readers is that if you dont have stocks in your portfolio you expose yourself to inflation risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats true</s>
<s>by owning stocks you do mitigate inflation risk but of course youre exposing yourself to equity risk to do it</s>
<s>its sort of like all these people who are now buying dividendyielding stocks because treasury bonds dont have any yield theyre exchanging a riskless asset for a risky asset</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but theres another asset class that people really dont think about when they think about inflation protection which is short highquality bonds with a maturity of less than three years</s>
<s>if we ever do get an inflationary shock investors will demand a high real shortterm rate of return</s>
<s>its what happened during the late 70s and early 80s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even though interest rates are terrible right now if inflation recurs  as i think it probably will  shortterm bonds are a fine place to be as are individual treasuries or certificates of deposit</s>
<s>since they mature soon you can replace them quickly with newer higherinterest bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>interest rates usually more than keep up with inflation</s>
<s>its true that real yields right now are historically low but as a student of financial history i have to believe thats not going to last forever</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>okay so stocks are risky at retirement</s>
<s>what about when im young</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the average person youll want a very high stock allocation</s>
<s>lets imagine you start working at age 25 and lets say for the sake of argument you have 35 years worth of human capital  that is 35 years of salary left in you</s>
<s>thats an asset that you own</s>
<s>what youve saved in one year for retirement is still minuscule compared to that 34 years of earning and saving that you have left</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so even if your investment capital when youre 26 years old falls by onehalf your total worth has fallen by only a couple of percent because you still have that 34 years of human capital left</s>
<s>your ability to earn and save dwarfs the loss in your portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and what about when im in the middle of my career</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the key phase</s>
<s>you need to start bailing out of risky assets as you get closer to achieving that liabilitymatching portfolioâ€”when you can win the game without taking so much risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related what to tell the kids about your money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of cutting your stock allocation one percentage point a year  the standard formula  in a year with absolutely spectacular returns you might want to take 4 or 5 off the table</s>
<s>in a series of years when stock returns have been poor you dont take anything off the table</s>
<s>and over time you start laying down a floor of safe assets with the proceeds from the stocks youve sold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when exactly am i doing this</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>getting close to hitting your number is usually going to happen during a bull market so the psychology of doing this right is tricky</s>
<s>its hard to cut back on risk and accept lower returns when your neighbors are getting rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre very lucky and very frugal hitting your number might happen when youre 45</s>
<s>in the worstcase scenario you do everything right and still come up short at 65 so you wind up working longer or greatly paring back your expectations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it sounds like retirement success depends on when you were born</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yeah that is certainly true</s>
<s>young people should get down on their knees and pray for a brutal bear market at the beginning of their savings career because thats going to enable them to buy a large number of shares cheaply</s>
<s>having a sequence of bad returns first followed by strong returns is the bestcase scenario</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i did a little thought experiment in which i calculated how many years it took people starting work in different years to make their number</s>
<s>i realized that the cohort that started working during the worst of economic times is the one that did the best</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related boost your retirement income minimize the risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the last cohort that actually was able to make their number started their careers in 1980 and they made their number in 19 years</s>
<s>and the graph ends in 1980 because no cohort that started work after 1980 actually made the number</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ouch</s>
<s>can the average person overcome that using the investing strategy you lay out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ive flown airplanes and as a doctor ive taken care of kids who cant walk</s>
<s>investing for retirement is probably harder than either of those first two activities yet we expect people to be able to do it on their own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an alternative would be to have a pension system such as in singapore where the government forces people to put money into a dedicated investment pool that it manages at minimal expense</s>
<s>and when people get to be of retirement age they are forced to annuitize some of those savings which turns into safe income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the political chances for a plan like that in the us seem low</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yeah im definitely in tune with the times</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what about targetdate mutual funds which gradually take on less risk as you age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre better than what 95 of people are going to do particularly if theyre run with low expenses</s>
<s>if youre not capable of doing what i suggest then a targetdate fund is not a bad solution</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what if you want an adviser to help you</s>
<s>how do you find a good one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>interview one and say look this is my portfolio now and you show him or her a simple cheap indexfund portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and if he says you know this is really good youve got the right idea i think we can diversify you a little more by using some more cheap index funds thats the answer you want to hear</s>
<s>youve probably found an honest adviser</s>
<s>and someone who adheres to an indexfund portfolio will probably be more likely to adhere to the policy because youve got someone who has some humility and realizes he doesnt know how to time the market</s>
