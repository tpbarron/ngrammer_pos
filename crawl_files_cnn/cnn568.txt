<s>new york cnnmoney  i hope to have $4 million saved by the time i retire in 30 years</s>
<s>that sounds like a lot of money but how much would that be in todays dollars</s>
<s> brian</s>

<p>
<s>it would seem as if $4 million should be enough to fund a comfy retirement 30 years from now</s>
<s>but youre right not to assume it will be sufficient</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one key issue is the purchasing power of future dollars versus todays dollars</s>
<s>most people are not accustomed to thinking of money in real or inflationadjusted terms</s>
<s>they use a calculator plug in the amount they plan to invest for the next 10 20 or 30 years throw in a rate of return often too high and come away with a big six or sevenfigure projected nest egg that they think shows theyll have it made in the shade in retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but psychologists and behavioral economists are familiar with our tendency to overestimate the value of future dollars</s>
<s>they even have a name for this phenomenon money illusion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>four million bucks does sound like a lot of money  and it still will be even 30 years from now</s>
<s>but it wont be worth anything close to $4 million today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unless we go through a sustained period of deflation inflation will erode the future purchasing power of that sum until to quote that great economic thinker yogi berra a nickel aint worth a dime anymore</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if inflation were a relatively modest 2 a year $4 million in 30 years would have the purchasing power of about $22 million today</s>
<s>and if inflation heats up to a 4 annual pace $4 million in 30 years would be the equivalent to about $12 million today</s>
<s>hardly chicken feed but a long way from $4 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youd like to see what any sum in the future is worth today at different rates of inflation check out this present value calculator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another key issue is our propensity to view the goal of retirement planning as accumulating a single large sum</s>
<s>the best example of this way of looking at retirement is the toooftenheard phrase whats your number</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its better to focus on the annual income youll need in retirement rather than some big lump sum</s>
<s>yes both are estimates but income is something thats more easily translated to a lifestyle</s>
<s>besides a big number can give you a false impression of how well off you are as it may not generate nearly as much annual income throughout retirement as you think</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example using the 4 rule a common metric for turning assets into income with a high probability of it lasting at least 30 years a $4 million nest egg would generate about $160000 in annual retirement income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats in 2042 dollars however</s>
<s>in terms of purchasing power $160000 would be the equivalent of about $88000 today assuming 2 inflation over the next 30 years or roughly $49000 at 4 inflation</s>
<s>still meaningful sums but they dont conjure up that feeling of having hit the jackpot that $4 million does</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one more issue that goes to the heart of retirement planning  how do you know whether youre saving enough to give yourself a realistic shot at a secure retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you hope to have $4 million socked away by the time you retire in 30 years</s>
<s>but what does that figure represent</s>
<s>is it the amount you project having based on how much you save and what you expect your investments to earn</s>
<s>is it the amount you think youll need to maintain your preretirement lifestyle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its hard to get an accurate fix on how much youll need to save for a retirement that wont begin for several decades</s>
<s>there are a lot of unknowns  how much youll earn in the future what sort of lifestyle youll lead over the next 30 years how long youll live</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you may not be able to save as much as you envision due to layoffs or higherthanexpected living expenses</s>
<s>your investments might not earn what you expect</s>
<s>you could be forced into retirement earlier than you wish by health problems or a rightsizing at work</s>
<s>no one can foresee how things will shake out over the next 10 years let alone the next 30</s>
<s>by going to a tool like our retirement planner or t rowe prices retirement income calculator you can make some reasonable assumptions about how much youll need for retirement how much you should save and how you should invest</s>
<s>from that you can get a sense of your chances of achieving a secure retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your assumptions arent going to be spot on</s>
<s>life and the financial markets are too unpredictable</s>
<s>but updating your information and assumptions in light of actual experience and redoing this exercise every couple of years will help monitor your progress</s>
<s>you can make adjustments in the amount you save how you invest or your planned retirement date</s>
<s>by making a number of small course corrections over the years youll reduce the chances of having to make dramatic changes on the eve of retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of wondering what $4 million will be worth in 30 years i recommend that you focus on getting a realistic idea of how much you should be saving and how you should be investing to retire in comfort  however many years from now that may be and however large a nest egg youll eventually need</s>
