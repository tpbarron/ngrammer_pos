<s>money magazine  im in my mid 60s and im rolling $15 million into an ira</s>
<s>id like to create a portfolio of 60 stocks and 40 bonds using lowfee etfs and mutual funds</s>
<s>is this a good plan  and which funds and etfs would you suggest</s>
<s> ollie f</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your plan is spot on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the real beauty of it is your focus on keeping investment expenses down a strategy that has the potential to boost returns by limiting the portion of the your investments gain siphoned off by the fund company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most people understand that lower costs and higher returns can help them amass more savings during a career but im not sure people appreciate the benefit of that combination in retirement  it can substantially reduce the danger of running through your savings too soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets say you plan to withdraw an initial 4 or $60000 from your $15 million at age 65 and then increase that amount for inflation each year</s>
<s>and lets further assume that your annual expenses run 15 a year a ballpark figure for people who invest in mutual funds and the like</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reducing your investing costs by half a percentage point to 1 a year can lower your probability of running through your savings before age 95 by roughly 25</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reduce your yearly investing expenses a full percentage point to 05  which is doable if you stick to etfs and index funds with the lowest expense ratios  and your chances of running through your dough within 30 years may decline almost by half</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres no guarantee that youll be able to duplicate these results exactly</s>
<s>thats because even though lowercost investments do generally lead to higher returns you cant be certain of getting a full percentage point in extra gain for each percentagepoint reduction in expenses</s>
<s>so your results will depend among other things on the return your investments earn net of fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but to whatever extent lower expenses boosts your returns your savings are likely to last longer at any given withdrawal rate</s>
<s>and thats a big deal in retirement when the last thing you want to do is run out of money before you run out of time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so where can you find etfs and funds that will allow you to reap the benefits of low expenses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just go to our money 70 list of recommended funds</s>
<s>there youll find plenty of funds and etfs that have expenses that are wellbelow their category averages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you really want to play the skinflint stick to the etfs and index funds on the list that follow broad stock and bondmarket benchmarks many of which have total annual expenses of 02 or less</s>
<s>and since research shows that people can become confused and overwhelmed when faced with a blizzard of choices i also recommend that you keep your portfolio simple</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre up for a real nomussnofuss approach you can create a 60 stocks40 bonds portfolio with just two investments a total stock market etf vti or index fund vtsmx plus a total bond market etf bnd or index fund vbmfx</s>
<s>that combo alone will give you a broadly diversified portfolio of us stocks of all sizes as well as highquality corporate and government taxable us bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you want to expand your stock holdings beyond the us you can devote 10 to 20 of the equity portion of your portfolio to a total international stock etf veu or index fund vgtsx which would add shares of both foreign developed and emerging markets to your holdings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can diversify even more broadly if you wish picking a real estate tips or commodities fund or etf</s>
<s>but before you start loading up on the everexpanding smorgasbord of alternative investments pitched by investment firms today be aware that more funds may not translate into better performance</s>
<s>in fact a complicated and unwieldy portfolio may lead to subpar results</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as you get older you may want to consider scaling back your stock holdings to prevent a market crash from decimating your nest egg late in life</s>
<s>heres how different firms make the transition from mostly stocks to mostly bonds in their targetdate retirement funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but whatever blend of stocks and bonds you start with and move to over time youll increase your chance of boosting your returns  as well as the longevity of your nest egg  by choosing etfs and funds that siphon off as few of your investment dollars as possible along the way</s>
