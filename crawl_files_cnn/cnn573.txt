<p>
<s>first congratulations on your decision to start saving right away</s>
<s>by starting early your savings have more time to benefit from the taxadvantaged compounding offered by plans such as 401ks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how quickly your savings grow however will depend in large part on how you allocate your assets</s>
<s>up until a few years ago many advisors would have encouraged a client in his early 20s to adopt a very aggressive allocation strategy — say 80 stocks and 20 bonds or even 100 stocks</s>
<s>the conventional wisdom was that you would have plenty of time to recover from any shortterm dips in the market and that stocks offer the best longterm growth potential compared to asset classes such as bonds or cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but  you may want to adopt a more conservative approach says leon james a senior financial advisor at anchor capital management in aliso viejo calif even at 22 or 23 you have to be careful says leon</s>
<s>were at a very tenuous position in our economy and you dont want to take a hit that you cant recover from until youre 30</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ultimately the right allocation for you depends on your tolerance for risk</s>
<s>if you lay awake at night worrying that a stock market correction will wipe out a big chunk of your savings then consider a more conservative allocation such as the 60 stock and 40 bond mix you suggest</s>
