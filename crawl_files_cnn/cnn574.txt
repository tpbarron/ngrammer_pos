<s>new york cnnmoney  we own some mutual funds that are doing well</s>
<s>but our financial adviser would like us to sell them and invest the proceeds in a variable annuity</s>
<s>do you think this is a good move</s>
<s> renate m</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont want to give the impression that every time a financial adviser recommends a variable annuity it means hes up to no good</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but when you consider the plethora of dubious sales tactics that have been used to peddle variable annuities over the years and the fact that both insurance and securities regulators stress caution when faced with an annuity pitch its only prudent that you should be wary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact i wouldnt even think of following an advisers recommendation to sell funds and invest in a variable annuity until i asked him the following three questions  and then took some time to weigh the answers either alone or with the help of another adviser who doesnt have a vested interest in my decision</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>question 1 why exactly do i need a variable annuity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you say the mutual funds you own are doing pretty well</s>
<s>but even if their performance were lagging you could just as easily replace them with other funds</s>
<s>so why is the adviser suggesting you go into a completely different type of investment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i suspect the adviser is going to offer two reasons either individually or in combination</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first is taxdeferral</s>
<s>when you invest in a variable annuity you get to spread your money among investments known as subaccounts that are much like mutual funds in that they allow you to invest in a portfolio of stocks bonds or both</s>
<s>but unlike with a regular mutual fund any investment gains generated by the subaccount go untaxed as long as those gains remain within the annuity</s>
<s>this taxdeferral has the potential to boost your aftertax returns beyond what you might earn in taxable investments like conventional mutual funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but that potential comes with a downside when you eventually withdraw investment gains from a variable annuity they are taxed at ordinary income tax rates even if those gains are longterm capital gains</s>
<s>that means that the same capital gain that would be taxed at no more than 15 today in a mutual fund could be taxed at a rate as high as 35 in a variable annuity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in effect by investing in a variable annuity you may be turning gains taxed at 15 into profit taxed at 35</s>
<s>that difference can pretty much destroy any benefit of an annuitys tax deferral and erode if not eliminate a variable annuitys value as a vehicle for building a nest egg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second reason your adviser might say you need an annuity is for guaranteed retirement income</s>
<s>its true that most variable annuities sold these days come with a rider known as a glwb or guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit</s>
<s>this rider assures that you can draw a given percentage of the annuitys value usually 4 to 6 depending on your age throughout retirement</s>
<s>annuities with this rider also often tout a guaranteed rate of return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but this income benefit and the return guarantee can be devilishly difficult to evaluate</s>
<s>and after youve taken the effort to do that youll often find that these benefits much like the taxdeferral mentioned above sound more appealing than they actually are</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>question 2 what will the annuity cost me</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most of the variable annuities sold by advisers are weighed down by several layers of fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as this securities and exchange primer on variable annuities points out there are insurance charges investment management fees and fees for various riders and extra features</s>
<s>these can often total upwards of 3 a year</s>
<s>there are also surrender fees if you pull out your money within a certain period of time typically six to eight years after buying</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more ascertaining exactly how much youll pay in fees is tough for most investors as it can require slogging through a long mindnumbing prospectus</s>
<s>for a look at a simpler quicker way to disclose annuity fees that ive proposed check out my ez annuity fee disclosure checklist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>question 3 can i achieve my goal without a variable annuity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although salespeople may make it seem like a variable annuity is if not the only then certainly the ideal solution for your needs i find that there are usually better ways to go</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when it comes to building a nest egg you should certainly go with 401ks and iras first</s>
<s>and even after youve maxed them out id say taxefficient index funds and taxmanaged mutual funds rank ahead of variable annuities as wealthbuilding vehicles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while a variable annuity with a lifetime income rider can provide reliable income throughout retirement i think a combination of mutual funds and a plain oldfashioned immediate annuity is a smarter and less costly way to go</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i suggest you take some time to mull this over before making a move</s>
<s>during that time you can also get a better handle on how annuities work by checking out the annuities section of our ultimate guide to retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the money youve invested in funds represents a significant portion of your savings  or youre just not confident about sorting through these issues alone  you might want to consult an adviser who will be willing to work for an hourly fee and thus have no interest in selling you an annuity or any other product</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bottom line though is that you should have reservations about making this switch</s>
<s>and you shouldnt proceed at all unless youre confident the move will benefit you and not just the adviserÂ </s>
