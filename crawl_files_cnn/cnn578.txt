<p>
<s>if an offer from a claims adjuster is lower than the estimated repair cost ask your insurer to explain how it was calculated said hunter</s>
<s>once its documented the insurer cant come up with new reasons for justifying the low settlement like saying a repair they originally estimated would cost $2000 will now only cost $1500</s>
<s>theyre locked in says hunter</s>
