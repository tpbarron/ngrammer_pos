<s>goldman sachs estimates that the fed could keep buying bonds through 2015 under its qe3 policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the federal reserves qe3 bond buying program announced earlier this month could last until the middle of 2015 and eventually reach $2 trillion according to an estimate from economists at goldman sachs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the goldman economists also wrote in a report that they believe the fed will not raise the federal funds rate until 2016</s>
<s>this rate which is used as a benchmark for a wide variety of consumer and business loans has been near 0 since december 2008</s>
<s>the fed said in its last statement that it expected rates would remain low until mid2015</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fed announced earlier this month that it would buy $40 billion a month in mortgages for the foreseeable future a plan that has been dubbed qe3 since it is the central banks third round of quantitative easing</s>
<s>the fed hopes that by pumping money into the economy lowering mortgage rates qe3 could lead to more consumer spending and more hiring by businesses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>goldmans $2 trillion estimate also includes the buying of longterm treasuries planned by the fed under an extension of what is popularly known operation twist</s>
<s> in that program the fed is selling shortterm treasuries to fund those purchases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the goldman economists also said they think the fed wants to see the nations unemployment rate in the 7 to 75 range before it ends its bond purchases and in the 65 to 7 range before it starts raising interest rates again</s>
<s>unemployment stood at 81 in august down from 83 in july</s>
<s>but much of the most recent decline was due to job seekers particularly young adults dropping out of the labor force as opposed to a pickup in hiring</s>

<p>
<s>the feds own forecasts call for the unemployment rate to be in the range of 67 to 73 in 2014</s>
<s>if that actually happens goldman said the fed could end qe3 in the middle of that year</s>
<s>at that point the bond purchases would have reached $12 trillion</s>
<s>but goldmans own forecasts call for a slower recovery in the job market and overall economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the recovery continues to disappoint additional steps are possible the goldman economists said</s>
<s>these include an increase in the pace of asset purchases as well as further changes in fed communications</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course predicting central bank policy far that far into the future is difficult</s>
<s>especially with the upcoming election</s>
<s>fed chairman ben bernankes term is set to end in january 2014</s>
<s>republican presidential candidate mitt romney has vowed to replace bernanke if elected and many top republicans were critical of qe3 when it was announced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if goldmans estimates are correct qe3 would be larger than the two previous rounds</s>
<s>its first round of asset purchases announced in 2009 came to $17 trillion</s>
<s>under qe2 announced two years ago the fed bought $600 billion in us treasuries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still many economists believe that qe3 wont create jobs as the fed hopes</s>
