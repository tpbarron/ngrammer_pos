<s>many overseas institutions are eligible under the 529 rules according to joseph hurley a cpa and founder of savingforcollegecom</s>
<s>you can search a list of eligible institutions provided by the us department of education at the federal student aid website httpsfafsaedgovfafsaappschoolsearch</s>
<s>under the state tab select foreign country and hit search</s>
<s> youll find about 450 school listed ranging from aarhus university in denmark to york university in toronto</s>

<s>if an international institution qualifies for 529 funds you can use your plan to cover tuition mandatory fees and — if your plan allows — other costs such as room and board</s>
<s>not all 529 plans are created equal however and if you have a prepaid 529 plan as opposed to a 529 savings plan you may not be able to apply the full value of the plan to outofstate — or outofcountry — institutions</s>

<p>
<s>if you do decide to withdraw the money from your plan to use for a noneligible institution or for noneligible expenses you will have to pay income tax and a 10 penalty on any earnings you withdraw</s>
