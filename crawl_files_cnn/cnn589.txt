<s>what will federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and co do next to stimulate the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  hiring has slowed economic growth has eased inflation is tame and millions of americans remain unemployed</s>
<s>in short the recovery is stalling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but after more than three years of trying to stimulate the economy what else is the federal reserve to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the predicament fed chairman ben bernanke and his crew will answer wednesday when the twoday federal open market committee meeting ends in washington</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>should they chose to act soon here are some options on the table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>likelihood high</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dubbed operation twist this policy swaps $400 billion in shortterm bonds for ones with a longer duration</s>
<s>the aim is to push down longterm interest rates thereby making it cheaper for businesses to get loans and consumers to get mortgages and other forms of credit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while its unclear just how effective operation twist has been so far it is true that longterm rates have come down since october when the program started</s>
<s>simultaneously mortgage rates have fallen too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just how much this has helped the economy though is questionable</s>
<s>even with mortgage rates at record lows new home sales have been choppy and banks are still unwilling to lend to anyone with lessthanperfect credit</s>
<s>small business owners are also struggling to get loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said the fed is still likely to consider extending operation twist beyond its original june 30 end date</s>
<s>unlike other methods of boosting the economy operation twist doesnt add to the balance sheet and therefore wont be met with as much resistance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>atlanta fed president dennis lockhart who just a month earlier had said he opposed the idea told reporters last week that its still one of several options on the table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the fed doesnt have much wiggle room in this area</s>
<s>should it decide to extend twist it has only a limited supply of shortterm bonds left in its arsenal</s>
<s>that diminishes the potential impact this plan could have</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>likelihood medium</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>buying more treasuries is another possibility for the fed but it comes along with greater risks</s>
<s>the central bank has already embarked on this policy  known as quantitative easing or qe  twice now and while it has pushed interest rates lower it has yet to solve the job markets woes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats because low interest rates arent effective unless banks lend out their money</s>
<s>that still isnt happening</s>
<s>the frequency at which money changes hands in the us economy is now at a record low</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>adding a third round of qe is unlikely to change that plus it comes with greater risks</s>
<s>it would increase the feds balance sheet and ignite controversy among conservatives and inflation hawks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said some economists think its still a possibility later this summer but only if the economic outlook gets worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernankes number two in command fed governor janet yellen has recently hinted to being open to such a policy if the recovery continues to struggle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke has been unwilling to offer any hints lately but watch for more from him in august</s>
<s>in the past few years he has waited until the kansas city feds key meeting in jackson hole wyo to break news of any bold new plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>likelihood low</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fed has kept interest rates near zero since december 2008 in an attempt to boost the economy</s>
<s>but the central bank can also have an impact merely by signaling to investors where it thinks interest rates should be in the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the feds most recent forecasts suggest interest rates should stay exceptionally low until late 2014</s>
<s>extending that language to say 2015 or later could spur economic activity by eliminating some uncertainty about future interest and inflation rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists say such a move is unlikely to have much impact though</s>
<s>so much can change over the next two or three years</s>
<s>the presidential election for one could change expectations for future tax and spending policies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plus the makeup of the fed is scheduled to change</s>
<s>bernankes term as chairman ends in january 2014 and whoever his successor is could have different ideas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yellen has said the effects of forward guidance are likely to be weaker the longer the horizon of the guidance implying that it may be difficult to provide much more stimulus through this channel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fed will release its official statement at 1230 pm</s>
<s>et on wednesday followed by a press conference with bernanke at 215 pmÂ </s>
