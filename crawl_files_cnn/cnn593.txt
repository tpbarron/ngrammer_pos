<s>the dow drops 300 points and everybody is tripping over themselves to say something else is to blame</s>
<s>but come on – everybody was expecting a drop with an obama win</s>
<s>i sure was and i even voted for him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for the other reasons people are giving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>europe  really</s>
<s>you just woke up and realized that europe is heading into a recession next year</s>
<s>saying today is about europe is a nice way of saying you dont like obama </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fiscal cliff</s>
<s>please</s>
<s>we have the same two dudes we did a year ago  boehner and obama</s>
<s>nothing has changed</s>
<s>they still have to go into a room cut a deal and move on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fact is most people on wall street are republicans and they see obama as antibusiness</s>
<s>i get it</s>
<s>so now wall street is reducing year end price targets for the sp</s>
<s>they think we have the status quo boehner and obama doing nothing polarized federal government and lame duck sessions in congress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but heres the thing</s>
<s>we are making a big assumption that what happened over the past few years will stay the same</s>
<s>and that is a bad investment strategy </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure there could be pressure on high dividend paying stocks if obama gets rid of the low dividend rate</s>
<s>and im not exactly going to go out and buy up coal stocks not that i was interested in them in the first place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related what the bond rally says about obamas next four years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but i can tell you what my firm is doing today  investing</s>
<s>we took some junk bonds off the table and rebalanced into some more small cap index funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we already have a ton of reits</s>
<s>why</s>
<s>they get no tax preference so obama cant screw something up that doesnt have a special deal in the first place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we are already overweight a bit in emerging markets</s>
<s>they appear to be bottomed out cheap and a nice compliment to our large us stock holdings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we still ignore europe for the same reasons we left almost 3 years ago</s>
<s>i dont need clients asking me why i own such a mess</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so lets be realistic</s>
<s>half of you are mad that your dude didnt win</s>
<s>perhaps you should sell everything since i hear obama could destroy america</s>
<s>sell your stock to me</s>
<s>i am just a dumb moderate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you dont freak out i cant trade with an edge</s>
