<s>atlanta federal reserve president dennis lockhart appears to be hinting the fed will rule nothing out at its next few meetings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal reserves next policy meeting is a twoday session concluding on june 20</s>
<s>thats just ten days before the feds operation twist policy  swapping shortterm bonds for ones with longer duration to help keep 10year and 30year bond yields low  expires</s>
<s>up until recently few expected the fed would seriously consider extending twist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but what a difference a lousy job report makes</s>
<s>atlanta fed president dennis lockhart who is a member of the feds policysetting open market committee this year told attendees after a speech in fort lauderdale fla wednesday morning that keeping twist going for longer is an option on the table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that may not be a complete 180 from what lockhart said just a few weeks ago after a speech he gave in japan</s>
<s>but you could maybe call it a 150</s>
<s>following remarks on may 21 in tokyo lockhart told reporters that my own view is that its not necessary to extend twist</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is important to note that lockhart never said twist wasnt an option a few weeks ago just that he personally didnt think it needed to be extended</s>
<s>in fact lockhart said in his tokyo speech that another round of quantitative easing or qe3 couldnt be ruled out</s>
<s>however he didnt seem in love with the idea of more qe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>qe3 will work under the right circumstances</s>
<s>but i dont believe such circumstances prevail at this time he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but is now the right time</s>
<s>to go from we dont need more twist just before memorial day to it now being an option for policymakers clearly shows that the fed is feeling pressure to do something as the markets convulse due to heightened worries about a us economic slump and the worsening crisis in europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors may get hints about the feds thinking today and tomorrow</s>
<s>san francisco fed president john williams also a voting member of the fomc will give a speech in bellevue washington later wednesday</s>
<s>that will be followed by a speech from fed vice chair janet yellen in boston</s>
<s>williams like lockhart is viewed by fed watchers as being fairly moderate when it comes to monetary policy</s>
<s>that is they are neither too dovish inclined to favor more stimulus or too hawkish ie</s>
<s>obsessed with inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but yellen like her boss ben bernanke is widely thought to be a permadove</s>
<s>so if lockhart is conceding that more twist is an option it seems safe to say that yellen and bernanke are also strongly considering it</s>
<s>and as fate would have it bernanke will testify on thursday morning in front of the joint economic committee of congress about the economy</s>
<s>you can bet that investors will be listening to every word for clues about whether the fed is leaning toward extending twist or in a move that would be even more drastic launching qe3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still the problem with more fed stimulus is that its debatable if it can really work</s>
<s>it may only placate nervous stock market traders and not have any tangible impact on the economy</s>
<s>keep in mind that longterm rates are already near record lows</s>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats why many economists as well as fed inflation hawks like my mancrush dallas fed president richard fisher are staunchly against qe3</s>
<s>it may now be up to the white house and capitol hill and not the fed to fix whats ailing the economy</s>
