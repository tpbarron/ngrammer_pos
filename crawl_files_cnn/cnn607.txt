<s>while the unemployment rate is lower that it was last year job creation has slowed to a crawl</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money magazine  for the third year in a row weve experienced a thaw in the economy only to be followed by some real dog days</s>
<s>the us is barely growing and a lot of the reason is that you arent spending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so it seemed like an opportune time to take a new look at a set of measures i wrote about in march of last year  the economic indicators that have the greatest effect on how you feel about the economy</s>
<s>as before i rank the current level of each indicator on an ascending scale of 1 to 10 based on past performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and they tell an interesting story three of the five indicators show improvement but youve nevertheless got very good reasons to feel like the economy remains stuck in a rut</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jobs and income a mixed bag</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at 82 the unemployment rate is almost a full percentage point lower than it was a year and a half ago</s>
<s>two problems first that number is still high</s>
<s>second its stopped declining as the rate of job creation has slowed to a crawl</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related where the jobs are</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the income numbers are even worse the inflationadjusted median wage fell 2 in 2011 after ticking down 05 in 2010</s>
<s>so our income score declined from 42 to 15</s>
<s>the march 2011 score was even higher but that was based on a data set that hasnt been updated</s>
<s>these scores are based on bureau of labor statistics numbers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the data so far for 2012 show wages are flat which isnt exactly cause for celebration</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>savings down homes up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a problem in an economy where the consumer accounts for about 70 of all activity</s>
<s>the more cushion you feel you have the more youre likely to spend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we seem to be sitting on the springs right now</s>
<s>gas and food prices bounce up and down and consumer confidence and discretionary spending go with them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>credit while cheap is readily available mainly to lowrisk borrowers</s>
<s>what little increase in spending there is seems to be coming at the cost of a savings rate that after rising in the financial crisis and its aftermath has fallen back</s>
<s>here too the prior score was higher than whats shown in the chart above due to revisions in the data</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile the outlook for real estate is brightening but after some very dark years in which foreclosures soared prices fell by a third and builders pretty much stopped building</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now sustained recordlow mortgage rates are nudging even skittish buyers to make the leap</s>
<s>thats helped longsuffering sellers improve their position</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related take advantage of near recordlow mortgage rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steady growth in home sales creates contractor jobs</s>
<s>and price appreciation which is starting to occur in some areas may be the silver lining in our economic cloud</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>manufacturing still bright</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the industrial production indicator measures the change in output of tangible goods</s>
<s>it mattered more when the us really was a manufacturing economy but it still provides a look at world demand for usmade stuff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>perhaps almost as important is that seeing trucks and trains and factory workers as opposed to mothballed plants and empty highways makes you feel as if the economy is humming</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>right now the ip number is showing strength although the rising value of the dollar against the euro could hurt us exporters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the average of our scores</s>
<s>a 40 almost exactly where we were in early 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>subpar but not 2008 either</s>
<s>keep that in mind as we head into the political mean season when candidates of all stripes will paint bleak pictures that they say can be improved  if only youd put or keep them in charge</s>
