<s>new york cnnmoney  the federal reserves most recent stimulus is expected to boost home prices and the stock market but what if youre too poor to invest in either</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fed unveiled its third round of stimulus last week</s>
<s>the massive bondbuying initiative called quantitative easing aims to prop up the economy through a few key channels  namely the housing market and the stock market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both of those channels skew in favor of americans who are already in solid financial standing and it seems the wealthier you are the more you have to gain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>quantitative easing is a blunt tool and cannot really target specific areas of the economy aside from mortgage rates</s>
<s>even then it tends to help the wealthy spectrum of the income distribution said sung won sohn economics professor at cal state channel islands</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>first by lowering mortgage rates the fed hopes to encourage more home sales and ultimately boost home prices</s>
<s>more home equity and less expensive home loans also put more money in consumers pockets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but with banks still skittish about lending only borrowers with the highest credit scores and large down payments can qualify for the lowest rates</s>
<s>thats limited the effects of lower rates on the housing market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because of ongoing restrictions in the supply of mortgage credit to customers with less than perfect credit records the impact of lower mortgage rates on housing is probably less powerful than normal said william dudley president of the federal reserve bank of new york in a speech tuesday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>only 67 of americans own their homes and the number is heavily skewed toward the wealthy</s>
<s>among the poorest fifth of american households most are renters</s>
<s>only 37 own homes according to fed data from 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related mortgage rates at record low again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second the feds low interest rate policies also tend to encourage investors to search for higher yields in stocks or riskier assets leading to big gains in the stock market</s>
<s>the sp 500 rallied 25 in the six months after the feds previous stimulus plan was announced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats been a boon for those who have most of their wealth in investments</s>
<s>but only 50 of americans have stock holdings</s>
<s>of those earning less than $20000 a year only 13 own stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the feds intention isnt to help the rich get richer</s>
<s>the main goal according to fed chief ben bernanke is to help the middle class by creating more jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a main street policy because what we are about here is trying to get jobs going bernanke said at a press conference last week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if people feel that their financial situation is better because their 401k looks better for whatever reason their house is worth more they are more willing to go out and spend and thats going to provide the demand that firms need in order to be willing to hire and to invest he said</s>
