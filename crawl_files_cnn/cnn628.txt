<s>consider other alternatives that can reduce how much you need to save</s>
<s>the most obvious one think about delaying retirement by a few years</s>
<s>that strategy will allow you make more contributions to your retirement accounts while postponing withdrawals  which could significantly increase the size of your nest egg even as it reduces the amount you need to accumulate to make it through retirement</s>

<s>for example if you retire today at age 65 with $500000 in retirement savings and withdraw $43000 a year your savings likely would last until you reached age 90</s>
<s>but if you delay retirement for another five years and max out your ira contributions during that period you would retire at 70 with $772680 saved</s>
<s>that nest egg would let you withdraw $72000 a year until age 90</s>
<s>calculations assume an 8 annual return on your investments</s>
<s> so by delaying your retirement just five years you can increase your retirement income by nearly $30000 a year</s>

<s>getting a parttime job after you retire also can make a big financial difference  and can provide mental physical and emotional benefits as well</s>
<s>other options include trading down to a lessexpensive home you can invest the profits toward retirement reining in your spending or transforming the equity in your home into income by taking out a reverse mortgage  though high costs mean this last option is a good idea for only a small number of retirees</s>
