<s>new york cnnmoney  extra attention will be paid to the job market this month when the government releases its jobs report friday  the last before the presidential election next week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the department of labor confirmed it will release the report on time despite earlier uncertainty surrounding the timing of the report after superstorm sandy closed federal offices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most forecasts arent predicting job growth to be much of an improvement over the 114000 jobs added last month</s>
<s>but the unemployment rate will be highly anticipated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in september the drop in unemployment was the big story</s>
<s>the household survey showed a surge in employment taking the jobless number from 81 to 78  the lowest in nearly three years and the exact level it was when president obama took office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but its unlikely that a similarly large number will show up in the household survey this month</s>
<s>thats partly because the looming election and budgetary issues in washington are creating a high degree of uncertainty according to lynn reaser chief economist at the fermanian business and economy institute at point loma nazarene university</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the implications for government spending taxes health care reform energy policy and regulation could have a profound impact on various companies said reaser</s>
<s>businesses are reluctant to make investments in new staff or facilities until greater clarity on these issues emerges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reaser is expecting job gains of 105000 and a slight rise in unemployment to 79</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related check the unemployment rate in your state</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with the jobs report coming so close to the election the number is bound to act as a lightning rod for both sides</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the unemployment rate rises republicans will likely seize on it as evidence that things have not improved under obama</s>
<s>if it falls democrats will argue they have</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it could shape the campaign rhetoric on both sides said sal guatieri chief economist at bmo capital markets</s>
<s>but barring a big change in either direction i dont think it will have a big bearing on the outcome</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more likely to drive voters according to guatieri is what the jobs picture looks like in their own economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it really comes down to what people see on the streets continued guatieri</s>
<s>if they see their neighbor or family members out of work thats much more significant than what they see in the data</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he predicts 130000 jobs added in october and a 79 unemployment rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more mediocre job growth would be relatively consistent with the amount of jobs added each month over the last year and a half</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but thats still better than the depths of the recession  when the economy was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month  but not high enough to put a significant dent in the unemployment rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists would like to see at least 150000 jobs created each month to keep pace with population growth even more to bring down unemployment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of the 88 million jobs lost during the financial crisis about 43 million have been added back</s>
<s>about 121 million people were unemployed in september and 40 of them have been so for six months or more</s>
