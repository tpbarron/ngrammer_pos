<s>money magazine  when houston attorney barbara quackenbush retired at age 67 she decided to stay on her company health plan through cobra rather than sign up for medicare</s>
<s>but as her cobra coverage neared expiration she learned that this choice will saddle her with a medicare penalty requiring her to pay 20 higher premiums</s>

<p>
<s>even scarier shell be left without coverage for 10 months</s>
<s>when quackenbush found out she says i was so upset i nearly dropped the phone</s>

<p>
<s>getting the signup process right can be tricky for anyone but its become a major headache for the growing number of folks working past 65 say advocates particularly now that medicare enrollment no longer comes at the same time people start collecting full social security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are pitfalls you must watch out for says david lipschutz a policy attorney at the center for medicare advocacy</s>
<s>here are four big ones to avoid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mistake no</s>
<s>1 not enrolling because youre employed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre still working and have coverage from your job you dont have to sign up at 65</s>
<s>many workers though benefit from enrolling especially when you consider that you can take parts a and b at different times</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>who should sign up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>part a which covers hospitals is a nobrainer for most people</s>
<s>its usually free and may pick up costs your job does not</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you work for a small company your firm may require that you take part b which covers doctor visits so that medicare can start paying most of your expenses</s>
<s>anyone with a highdeductible plan can also benefit from part b since it often picks up costs before youve met the deductible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a caveat if you have a health savings account you must stop making deposits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>who should hold off on part b</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>workers at large companies</s>
<s>the plan costs at least $100 a month and often provides little benefit beyond what their job covers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mistake no</s>
<s>2 failing to sign up when you or your spouse retires</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you must enroll in part b eight months from your last month of work even if you have retiree benefits or cobra</s>
<s>miss that date and your coverage wont kick in for three to 15 months</s>
<s>youll also face a 10 premium penalty for every 12 months you delay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for quackenbush going on cobra for 18 months without enrolling in part b triggered a penalty and waiting period</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related figuring out health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre 65 or older and get benefits from your spouses job remember that the same rules apply when she retires says frederic riccardi of the medicare rights center you must sign up within eight months of her final month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mistake no</s>
<s>3 accidentally voiding retiree coverage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>signing up for an advantage plan which offers coverage as an alternative to parts a and b could prompt your former employer to kick you off its insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related the painful new trend in medicare</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>going with a private part d plan which covers drugs may have the same effect</s>
<s>the reason says john grosso a consultant at aon hewitt is that most retiree coverage is designed to work with traditional medicare and isnt compatible with private plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mistake no</s>
<s>4 not considering medigap early on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first six months after you enroll in part b is usually the cheapest time to buy a medigap plan which covers deductibles and other costs not picked up by medicare</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people still covered by their job may not need medigap right away but if you buy after this sixmonth period your monthly premium could jump by $50 or more especially if you have a health problem</s>
<s>worse you could end up being denied</s>
