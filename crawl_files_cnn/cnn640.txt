<s>new york cnnmoney  women are finding their way back into the workforce</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the economic upswing had until recently been a hecovery but the revival is now becoming more balanced between the genders</s>
<s>the number of women employees has jumped by 300000 in the past six months nearly the same amount as men</s>
<s>and in september men and women each saw a job gain of 57000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the recovery has definitely picked up for women in the last year said joan entmacher vice president of family economic security at the national womens law center</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>womens financial wellbeing over the past four years is a hot topic in this years election as president barack obama and challenger mitt romney each court their vote</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in tuesdays debate obama hailed his signing of the lily ledbetter law which lengthened the time women could sue employers for pay discrimination</s>
<s>romney meanwhile attacked the presidents economic record by saying that 580000 women have lost jobs and 35 million more women fell into poverty in the past four years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would have been right about the jobs figures had it still been spring</s>
<s>women were hit hard by job losses in the public sector  particularly in schools  which accelerated in 2011 after stimulus funds ran out</s>
<s>governments continued to shed jobs well after the private sector started reviving delaying womens recovery since they make up 59 of the state and local workforce</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and as governments looked to tighten their financial belts they reduced funding for job support initiatives  particularly subsidized child care programs that allow poor women to seek and retain jobs</s>

<p>
<s>but governments have finally begun to stem job losses over the past year</s>
<s>local school districts added 79000 jobs between july and september the strongest summer hiring since 2006</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at this point women have recovered 32 of the jobs lost in the recession while men have gained back 43 according to entmacher</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>women are also benefiting from gains in education and health services in the private sector entmacher said as well as professional and business services which include temp jobs</s>
<s>for roughly every one job lost in the public sector women have gained three in the private industry since june 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when it comes to wages women have actually done better than men in recent years</s>
<s>women collected $684 in median weekly earnings last year up from $667 in 2008 said heidi hartmann president of the institute for womens policy research</s>
<s>mens wages meanwhile remained stagnant at around $834</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this could be because womens employment has increased greatly in higherwage industries like health care she said</s>
<s>on the flip side men have lost good paying jobs in manufacturing and construction which havent recovered</s>
<s>also women are becoming more educated which often translates into higher wages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney was more accurate about the poverty figures</s>
<s>there were 257 million women in poverty in 2011 up from 221 million in 2008 according to census bureau data</s>
<s>the share of women in poverty has held even at 56 since the overall number of poor americans jumped as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>womens fortunes however could soon take another turn for the worse entmacher said</s>
<s>if looming federal budget cuts become a reality women could get slammed by a new round of government downsizing and reduced funding to child care programs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the real risk going forward are these public sector job cuts and the loss of job supports that have helped poor women entmacher said</s>
