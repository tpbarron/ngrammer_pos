<s>new york cnnmoney  by now youre probably aware that on friday microsoft is launching windows 8 a touchenabled completely reimagined version of its nearly threedecade old pc operating system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft will also be debuting a second related operating system called windows rt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though windows 8 and windows rt look exactly alike theres a fundamental technical difference between the two operating systems</s>
<s>buyers could be in for a big shock if theyre not in the know before choosing their next pc</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what is windows 8</s>
<s>windows 8 is a full version of windows</s>
<s>it supports all your old windows software than runs on windows 7 vista and xp</s>
<s>windows 8 will also run a batch of new tabletlike apps available through the justlaunched windows store</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>windows 8 brings in a radically new interface built around a start screen</s>
<s>its filled with large tiles fullscreen apps and hidden menu functions</s>
<s>windows 8 also has a second more traditional interface desktop mode</s>
<s> that features smaller app icons taskbars and menu ribbons</s>
<s>both modes work with touch or a mouse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what is windows rt</s>
<s>windows rt on the other hand will not support any windows software that ran on older versions of windows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with just two exceptions windows rt will only run start apps and the only place to get software is through microsofts windows store</s>
<s>the two outliers are new versions of microsoft office and internet explorer that microsoft made especially for windows rt</s>
<s>those will run in the familiar desktop mode</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when youre buying a windows rt device like the $499 surface tablet that goes on sale friday you are not buying a pc that can run your old windows applications</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so whats the point of windows rt</s>
<s>microsoft created windows rt  a kind of windows 8 lite  so it could put its operating systems on a batch of new mobile devices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the vast majority of tablets  about 95  run on microchips designed by a company called arm holdings armh</s>
<s>arm processors help manufacturers make gadgets that are thinner cheaper and have longer battery lives</s>
<s>however theyre incompatible with previous versions of windows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rather than force developers to recode each of the millions of apps that run on older intelbased windows iterations microsoft created two flavors of its new operating system</s>
<s>only one  windows 8  supports legacy apps but both windows 8 and windows rt run the new brand of start apps which will likely become the standard form of windows app going forward</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple aapl fortune 500 solved this problem a different way</s>
<s>it created a fully separate operating system for the iphone ipad and ipod touch called ios which looks completely different from its mac os operating system for intelbased macintosh pcs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft msft fortune 500 opted instead to give windows rt and windows 8 much of the same code</s>
<s>that could confuse consumers who wont be able to see much of a difference until they try and fail to install a browser itunes adobe adbe photoshop or some other program from the internet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how many apps are available on windows rt</s>
<s>microsoft has around 5000 stocked in the windows store but many favorites are missing</s>
<s>netflix has an app but theres no facebook fb twitter pandora p or instagram</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the number of apps will increase quickly if consumers start adopting windows 8</s>
<s>until then early windows tablet adopters will be at a disadvantage against those with apple and google goog fortune 500 tablets whose stores have hundreds of thousands of apps</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what if i want a windows tablet that doesnt run rt</s>
<s>youll have to shell out more money but theyre available  and more are coming soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>intel intc fortune 500 has a new suite of microchips designed for tablets and a number of windows 8 tablets are available from vendors including dell dell fortune 500 samsung toshiba asus and lenovo</s>
<s>hewlettpackard hpq fortune 500 has an envy tablet due out in early november and a higherend enterprise tablet coming in january</s>
<s>they tend to cost $150 to $500 more than windows rt tablets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsofts own surface pro tablet will go on sale in january</s>
<s>it will be slightly heavier than the windows rt version and have a price tag around $1000 but it will be a complete windows 8 machine</s>
