<s>as much as you can is the standard advice</s>
<s>many financial planners recommend that you save 10 to 15 of your income for retirement starting in your 20s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but thats just a general guideline</s>
<s>this is your retirement were talking about so it pays to get a little more specific by doing your homework up front</s>
<s>its a good idea to establish a savings target  one that tells you roughly how much you should set aside over time to meet your retirement goals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the best way to determine your savings target is to use an online calculator like this one</s>
<s>it will help you figure out how much you should accumulate and how much you must set aside in the meantime to reach that target</s>
<s>be sure to update the calculation each year so that you can see if youre on track</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a general rule youll need at least $15 to $20 in savings to cover each dollar of the annual shortfall between your income and your expenses</s>
<s>so for example if your projected retirement expenses exceed social security and pensions by $20000 a year you might need a nest egg of $300000 to $400000 to bridge the gap</s>
