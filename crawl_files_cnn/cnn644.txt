<s>fossils stock took a beating tuesday making it the secondworst performer on the sp 500 spx and nasdaq comp after the company reported weak revenue and cut back its sales outlook for the current quarter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fossil fosl reported thirdquarter sales of $6842 million falling short of the $7131 million analysts had expected</s>
<s>earnings fared better</s>
<s>fossil beat earningspershare forecasts by 9 cents</s>
<s>but europe once again reared its ugly head and took a big bite out of the companys sales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a stronger us dollar was also to blame for the sales shortfall which fossil said resulted in a decrease of $222 million in overall thirdquarter sales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one bright spot remains asia where sales rose nearly 27</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still that wasnt enough to keep investors and stocktwits traders from weighing in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>firstadopter $fosl call their retail stores in europe getting better due to traffic from new jewelry offerings wholesale biz is where weakening is</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wholesale sales were barely higher so if fossil can make it up with foot traffic to its stores then there is room to turn things around before yearend</s>
<s>and even though the company trimmed back its sales forecast fossil still expects a 12 increase in the fourth quarter</s>
<s>thats not too shabby</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bradloncar $fosl makes a quality product for a good price</s>
<s>not the type of company id want to short regardless of an earnings report or two</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that might be a very good point</s>
<s>just six months ago fossils stock sank nearly 40 for the exact same reason europe</s>
<s>but fast forward to august when the stock rallied 30 on a strong earnings report</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but not everyone was sold on fossils ability to turn things around</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>berserker $fosl when is the last time you saw a fossil commercial</s>
<s>1996</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fossil has made some notable acquisitions and shouldnt be written off just yet</s>
<s>earlier this year fossil acquired skagen which makes watches and other accessories</s>
<s>and the company has had a longstanding relationship with michael kors kors dkny armani and others</s>
