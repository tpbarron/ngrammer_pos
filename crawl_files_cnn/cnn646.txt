<s>i have an ira worth $225000 which is mostly in cash at a wellknown brokerage firm</s>
<s>i know sipc covers up to $500000 for brokerage firms with sipc insurance but i think it only covers $250000 for cash values</s>
<s>can i split my ira to another firm</s>

<s>your total is currently below the $250000 coverage limit on cash so securities investor protection corporation insurance  which protects assets held at a brokerage if the firm fails or if a broker steals from a customer account  will automatically cover your entire balance in your existing ira even though its mostly cash and so would likely qualify for the lower coverage limit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but should your ira grow beyond the $500000 overall limit or the cash portion of your ira exceeds the $250000 limit you can maintain coverage in one of two ways according to sipc president stephen harbeck</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first consider rolling over some of your ira assets into another account such as a roth ira</s>
<s>according to the sipc series 100 rules accounts held in different capacities by one customer are considered to be accounts held by separate customers</s>
<s>that means you could have a traditional ira and a roth ira at the same firm and each would be covered separately up to the $250000 cash limit and $500000 total limit says harbeck</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your second option involves opening an account with a second firm</s>
<s>you could have two traditional iras at two separate brokerage firms and they both would be subject to separate sipc coverage limits</s>
<s>having multiple iras you should know doesnt mean you can contribute more</s>
<s>youll still only be able to contribute the annual maximum which this year is $5000 or $6000 if youre 50 or older</s>
