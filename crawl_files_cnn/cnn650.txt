<s>my son is a junior in college</s>
<s>we have been financing his education by using $5500 a year in federal direct subsidized loans in his name</s>
<s>i am paying for his college as a gift to him so that he will not be burdened with a loan upon graduation</s>
<s>would it be best for me to pay off the loan over a period of time so as to help him build a credit history</s>
<s>if so for how long</s>
<s>i do want to avoid unnecessary interest so the shorter the period the better</s>
<s>i might even be able to pay off the entire amount of about $20000 when he graduates</s>

<p>
<s>if paying off the loan in one fell swoop would jeopardize your ability to meet your monthly expenses its not worth it says michael pontillo a certified college planning specialist based in crotononhudson ny</s>
<s>but if you have enough money to erase the debt it makes sense to pay off the loan as soon as possible — ideally before interest starts accruing at the end of the sixmonth grace period after your sons graduation</s>

<p>
<s>as for your sons credit history it will receive a boost when the loan is paid off says pontillo even if the debt is settled right away</s>
<s>and  your son has time to get a credit card and start building his credit history himself adds the planner</s>

<p>
<s>just remember to pay attention to the gifttax exemption</s>
<s>you can currently gift up to $13000 per person per year without the gifts counting against your lifetime exclusion limit</s>
<s>this year the combined estate and gift tax exclusion is more than $5 million but that figure may change next year</s>
<s> if youre married you and your spouse can give your son a combined $26000 in a given year</s>
