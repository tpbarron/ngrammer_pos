<s>as you approach retirement age most experts agree you should gradually shift more into bonds to protect the money youve accumulated</s>
<s>but retirement can last a few decades so it generally pays to maintain a healthy dose of stocks well into retirement possibly between 40 and 50 while youre in your 70s and up to 30 when youre in your 80s</s>

<s>if you want to put your asset allocation on autopilot consider targetdate retirement funds which are available in many retirement plans</s>
<s>you simply choose a fund thats labeled with the year you intend to retire and it will automatically adjust what it invests in usually a mix of stocks bonds and cash to maximize your return and minimize your risk as you get older</s>
