<s>the answer is simple as soon as you can</s>
<s>ideally youd start saving in your 20s when you first leave school and begin earning paychecks</s>
<s>thats because the sooner you begin saving the more time your money has to grow</s>
<s>each years gains can generate their own gains the next year  a powerful wealthbuilding phenomenon known as compounding</s>

<s>heres an example of what a big difference starting young can make</s>
<s>say you start at age 25 and put aside $3000 a year in a taxdeferred retirement account for 10 years  and then you stop saving  completely</s>
<s>by the time you reach 65 your $30000 investment will have grown to more than $472000 assuming an 8 annual return even though you didnt contribute a dime beyond age 35</s>

<p>
<s>now lets say you put off saving until you turn 35 and then save $3000 a year for 30 years</s>
<s>by the time you reach 65 you will have set aside $90000 of your own money but it will grow to only about $367000 assuming the same 8 annual return</s>
<s>thats a huge difference</s>
