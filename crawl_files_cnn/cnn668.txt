<s>oceanside calif cnnmoney  from the outside it looks like a crashlanded blimp</s>
<s>on the inside it feels like a wind tunnel</s>
<s>for inventor david chelf this strange structure  a hightech greenhouse with no skeleton whose lightweight skin is held aloft on breezes from giant fans  looks like the future of agriculture</s>

<s>i knew nothing could grow without airflow chelf explains</s>
<s>and i thought if i could work with natural forces like the wind maybe i could create a structure that held itself up with very little energy</s>

<p>
<s>chelf the founder of airstream innovations derived his unusual greenhouse from a single principle plants grow healthier and more productively in moving air</s>
<s>he prefers a gentle threemilesperhour wind which he says is perfect for helping moisture evaporate from plant leaves without dehydrating them</s>

<p>
<s>when leaves are too wet diseases and fungus can take hold</s>
<s>when they are too dry photosynthesis slows or stops altogether</s>
<s>the right amount of moving air makes crops grow more efficiently he says adding that his organic strawberry plants use onethird the water and produce five times the berries compared to those grown in fields</s>
<s>a peek inside one of chelfs greenhouses during a recent visit revealed rows of strawberry plants heavy with red ripe fruit</s>
<s>on closer inspection the strawberries tasted as sweet and delicious as they looked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chelfs greenhouses use highvolume fans that require little outside power because they harness the wind i realized i could direct that inside rather than wasting a lot of energy resisting it he says</s>

<p>
<s>made of heavily reinforced plastic his greenhouse is about 33 feet wide and 330 feet long with a tower for air intake at one end</s>
<s>the upper half of the tower has flaps that open inward funneling wind to a pair of fans below which reduces the power needed to keep them spinning</s>
<s>a gauzy netting around the fans catches insects sucked in from the outside</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in cold weather the incoming wind can be slowed to a trickle allowing the air to be heated before it blows into the greenhouse</s>
<s>in times of extreme heat air gets cooled the same way its done in traditional greenhouses by introducing mist and letting it evaporate or by using evaporative cooling pads</s>

<s>we call it our bubble house says james russell armstrongs vice president</s>
<s>we find there are no insects which is superimportant when youre growing organically and weve seen reduced disease</s>
<s>theres just nothing else like it on the market</s>

<s>richard j gladon an associate professor of horticulture at iowa state university who specializes in greenhouse design and management also says airstreams creation is unique</s>
<s>although gladon doesnt think any system can completely eliminate disease or insects he says the faninflated greenhouse looks like a good inexpensive way to start growing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an airstream innovations greenhouse covers about an acre of land and costs $120000 installed which includes fans the air intake tower and an automatic ventilation control system</s>
<s>over the last two years airstream innovations sales have totaled about $1 million</s>
<s>the company has two fulltime and three parttime employees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chelfs ties to the greenhouse business go back decades he had almost finished a phd in physics in 1990 when he quit to build a greenhouse with a friend on 10 acres in the mohave desert</s>
<s>after the two parted ways in 1996 chelf worked for a salad grower in silanas calif and developed a system to shade the plants with low wirehoop arches covered in cloth</s>
<s>in 2005 he began growing organic strawberries in a greenhouse he built in ranchita calif under the brand name wicked wilds and sold them to highend restaurants in southern california</s>
<s>he continued experimenting with greenhouse design ultimately developing one that became the basis for airstream innovations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of chelfs challenges has been getting growers to follow his operating rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one wouldbe customer in sonora mexico who tested the greenhouse mistakenly believed the door needed to be closed to keep the structure standing</s>
<s>with the door sealed airflow slowed to almost nothing nearly killing the crops inside</s>
<s>another customer pried the exhaust open when a hurricane was on its way decreasing the pressure inside</s>
<s>the underpressurized greenhouse collapsed in the subsequent storm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its been a great learning experience seeing the things that can go wrong chelf says</s>
<s>he spent the last year making the greenhouse idiotproof</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stan cox a senior scientist with the land institute in salina kan a nonprofit organization that conducts breeding and ecological research for sustainable growing says hes seen ideas similar to chelfs in other forms and places but never assembled in this way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his ideas are new to greenhouse use and hes found a way to organize it package it and market it cox says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chelf acknowledges that he didnt invent inflatable structures or ventilation but hes implemented them in a novel way to make his greenhouse a unique and affordable option for growers</s>
<s>for evidence of how well it works he points to those strawberries the proof he concludes is in the eating</s>
