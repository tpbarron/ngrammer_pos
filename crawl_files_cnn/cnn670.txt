<s>if you find yourself running short on time  say youre in your 40s or even your 50s and you havent gotten started yet  there are still a few things you can do</s>
<s>the key is to do them now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you should first max out your contributions to taxfavored retirement accounts like iras and 401ks for 2012 the irs allows $17000 for a 401k though your employer may impose lower limits and $5000 for traditional and roth iras</s>
<s>if youre over 50 you can contribute additional catchup contributions</s>
<s>even the government understands that this is crunch time and it has devised a few ways to help you out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example workers age 50 and older can put more money into iras and workplace retirement plans than younger savers can</s>
<s>that means you can and should contribute an additional $5500 to a 401k and $1000 to traditional and roth iras</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre arriving late to retirement planning a traditional ira may be a better choice than a roth</s>
