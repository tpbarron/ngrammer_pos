<s>new york cnnmoney  a new kind of global arms race is unfolding  and this one is measured in petaflops</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>titan the us department of energys top open science computer is going live on monday with an upgrade that will likely make it the fastest supercomputer on the planet</s>
<s>at 20 petaflops  thats 20 quadrillion calculations each second  titan outperforms by four petaflops the does sequoia supercomputer which has held the crown since june</s>
<s>the official top 500 ranking of the worlds fastest supercomputers will be announced next month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the united states is back on top of the computing world after ceding ground to japan china and germany over the past three years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats not just a badge of honor its also critical to national security and the countrys economic viability</s>
<s>titan will help us scientists pioneer research into climate change biofuels nuclear energy new materials and other crucial fields which will help them create the next wave of car batteries switchgrass ethanol and improved weather forecasting tools  all developed in america</s>

<p>
<s>formerly known as jaguar the cray cray supercomputer at the does oak ridge national laboratory got a major upgrade and an appropriately intimidating new name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>titan replaced its predecessors 224256 central processing units cpus with 299008 faster cpus made by amd amd fortune 500 along with 18688 graphics processing units gpus made by nvidia nvda</s>
<s>the gpus serve as accelerators to the cpus</s>
<s>thats why titan has just a third more central processors and the same number of computing nodes and cabinets as jaguar but delivers 10 times the performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even more crucially titans processors are five times more energyefficient than their predecessors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related story what its like to play with the jaguar supercomputer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>power constraints are the biggest challenge in the race to maximize speed</s>
<s>running at just 23 petaflops jaguar required 7 megawatts of energy  the same amount of electricity required to power 7000 homes</s>
<s>the cost of simply plugging in jaguar was $7 million last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if jaguar had been expanded with cpus not gpus a 20 petaflop machine would have required 60 megawatts of power at a cost of $60 million</s>
<s>that would have been a dealbreaker</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the oak ridge national laboratory says titans energy costs are very slightly higher than jaguars</s>
<s>the systems design is a responsible move toward lowering our carbon footprint says jeff nichols laboratory director at the oak ridge national laboratory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the gpus powering titan arent special</s>
<s>theyre actually same the hardware thats in highend consumer pcs popularized by hardcore pc gamers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not the first time gaming has helped supercomputing</s>
<s>ibms ibm fortune 500 roadrunner supercomputer at the los alamos national laboratory runs on the same processors used in the sony sne playstation 3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it costs billions of dollars to develop highperformance computing processors and theres no way to make that money back says steve scott chief technology officer at nvidia</s>
<s>we couldnt do what were doing without a consumer business for these processors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so whats the does plan for all of titans new speed and power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the oak ridge national laboratory plans to stay focused on the 40 projects currently using the supercomputer</s>
<s>instead of tens of millions of cpu hours each project will get hundreds of millions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that will help researchers accelerate their breakthroughs</s>
<s>still its only a matter of time before theyll want more</s>
<s>by 2016 the department of energy will be upgrading titan to its successor which it hopes will reach 200 petaflops  10 times the speed of titan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>demand will never stop scott says</s>
<s>once were on the verge of an exaflop  thats 1 quintillion calculations per second  scientists will be talking about their demand for a zettaflop</s>
