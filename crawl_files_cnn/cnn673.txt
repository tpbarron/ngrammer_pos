<s>new york cnnmoney  parents are doing whatever they can to send their kids to college without leaving them drowning in debt upon graduation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that includes asking their collegebound kids to live at home and commute to classes or major in areas of study that will lead to more lucrative careers</s>
<s>many parents are even asking their children to start saving for college when theyre as young as 13 a fidelity survey of 2000 families with children 18 or younger found</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the study found that the average family hopes to pay for 57 of the total cost of college  saying that the rest will come from loans scholarships or gifts</s>
<s>but still many are coming up woefully short with families reporting that they are only on track to meet 30 of their savings goals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and college tuition continues to rise with the average annual cost of a private fouryear college hovering around $28500 for the 2011 school year  up nearly 5 from the previous year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>parents are trying to do their very best for their children and they want their children to go to college said keith bernhardt head of college planning at fidelity</s>
<s>but it does seem to have gotten tougher over the last few years so were seeing more parents considering shared sacrifices and taking steps to have their kids help pay for college or somehow reduce the cost of college</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>making it work nearly half of parents surveyed said they plan to ask their children to put aside some of their own money to pay for college and about 25 have already asked their children to start saving</s>
<s>on average the children are just barely 13 years old when theyre asked to start tucking away money for college  and theyre expected to save a median of $4000 by the time they enroll</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many parents are also asking their kids to make some compromises when it comes to their college experience</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thanks to the high cost of room and board for example almost half or 49 of parents said they are considering having their child live at home and commute to school to save on college costs</s>
<s>thats up from 34 in 2007 when the survey was first conducted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related over 50 with student debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>having your child live at home is a big sacrifice when you think about how thats one of the big selling points of a college experience but room and board makes up about a third of college expenses said bernhardt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another 43 of parents said they will encourage their child to attend a public school while 57 are considering asking their child to work parttime while attending school</s>
<s>another 27 will suggest that their child graduate in fewer semesters</s>
<s>meanwhile 65 said they will require their child to maintain a certain gpa  and the average family will help pay tuition if their kid earns a 31 gpa or higher</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>parents are also encouraging their children to pick majors that will help them land highpaying jobs with 42 of parents saying they gave their kids a nudge</s>
<s>among the top picks cited computer science nursing engineering psychology biology and accounting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>parents who ask their children to focus on these highpaying majors said they expect them to earn an average of $70300 upon graduation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related the 15 college majors with the biggest payoffs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that first salary is important since many college students graduate with massive amounts of debt</s>
<s>but parents are surprisingly optimistic about their childrens financial prospects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>overall parents said they expect their child to graduate with an average $14600 in student loan debt  much lower than the $25250 debt load that the average college student currently owes</s>
<s>and they anticipate that it will take their child about 8 years to pay off this debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of the studys more disappointing findings was that only 31 of parents have spoken with their kids about the total costs of college and future job opportunities earnings potential and possible debt load  meaning a whopping 69 havent adequately broached the subject said bernhardt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>saving for college can be stressful and emotional said bernhardt</s>
<s>we really want to promote more families having that conversation because when they do a good chunk of them think about making changes to their plans</s>
