<s>kayak enjoyed a strong debut in its initial public offering  proof that facebooks troubled deal didnt kill demand for new stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so much for facebook fb nailing the ipo window shut</s>

<p>
<s>what facebook taught us is not that its a mistake to go public</s>
<s>its a mistake to have the hubris to think that just because you have 900 million users you can clearly justify a valuation of more than $100 billion  especially when your growth is already starting to slow</s>

<s>the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul r la monica</s>
