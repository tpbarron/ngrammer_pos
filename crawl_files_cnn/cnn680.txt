<p>
<s>on a purely mathematical basis youre better off focusing your efforts on first paying off the loan with the highest interest rate</s>
<s>over time that strategy will save you the most money because you wont be spending so much on interest payments</s>
<s>on a psychological basis that may not necessarily be true personal finance guru dave ramsey for example argues that paying off the smallest debt first by giving you a quick victory in the debtelimination process better motivates you to pay off all your loans</s>

<p>
<s>in your case the higherinterest debt and the lowerbalance debt are the same one making the decision easy direct your extra payments to paying down the student loan with the 3 interest rate</s>
<s>while the rate difference between the two isnt huge it has the higher interest rate and youll get the satisfaction of having one bill paid off says neil collins of collins financial advisors in melrose mass</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said collins notes that both loans have very favorable rates and suggests considering other ways to use the extra cash in your budget</s>
<s>for instance boosting your contributions to retirement savings accounts such as your 401k or ira may provide more bang for your buck than accelerating payments on your student loan or car loan</s>
<s>at the very least make sure youre saving the minimum to take advantage of any 401k match he says</s>
<s>and if you have a little extra you can put it in an ira or a roth ira</s>
