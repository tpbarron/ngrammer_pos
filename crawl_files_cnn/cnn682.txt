<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  google launched a new flight search service on tuesday putting it in direct competition with travel search players including orbitz and kayak</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>starting tuesday when a user searches for flight information  like flights from new york to chicago  a flights link will appear on the left side of googles search page</s>
<s>google flight search can also be accessed directly at googlecomflights</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from there google goog fortune 500 displays a shortlist of flights based on cost and total travel time including various departure times and airlines</s>
<s>filters are set for reasonable price and duration but users can manipulate them to show more flights</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one unique feature is an openended destination users can click the flight search map and use filters to see where they can go within certain time and cash boundaries</s>
<s>for example a san francisco flyer can check where he can visit within 3 hours for less than $300</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the selection of flights shown is not influenced by any paid relationships with the airlines google said</s>
<s>flight search is currently limited to roundtrip economyclass flights between certain us cities but it will be expanded in the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>flight search is the first product of googles controversial $700 million purchase of ita the worlds largest airline search software company</s>
<s>ita data is used on websites including kayak orbitz expediacom tripadvisor and microsofts msft fortune 500 bing as well as a number of airlines websites</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after google announced its intent to buy ita in july 2010 travel search players raised concerns about search behemoth google having unfettered access to valuable flight data</s>
<s>reuters said that kayak with backing from expediacom offered to buy ita to prevent google from purchasing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in april the department of justice said google could buy ita only if the search giant accepted certain restrictions to avoid a monopoly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even with the caveats googles entry into the travel search space is a blow to rivals</s>
<s>for example bing has advertised flight information as a key point of differentiation between it and google</s>
<s>on bing users can enter domestic flight queries and the engine will predict when it is best for users to buy a ticket</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beyond the big players newbies in the field are surely taking note  startups like hipmunk which is focused solely on simplifying flight search are now contending with a huge name</s>
