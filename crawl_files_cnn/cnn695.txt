<s>diners check can order and tally bills with e la cartes tablet system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  many startups have been hatched over dinner</s>
<s>rajat suris was sparked by the bill delivered afterward</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dining with seven friends at a harvard square restaurant suri and the others found themselves trying to divvy up the bill</s>
<s>some of the mit and harvard university graduate students wanted to pay with credit cards</s>
<s>others had cash</s>
<s>more than an hour after their meal they were still trying to sort it out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our joke was how many mit students does it take to figure out a bill</s>
<s> suri now 25 recalls</s>
<s>i figured if we have that problem others do too and there must be a way to fix it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at that moment an idea was born equipping restaurant tables with tablet computers that would allow diners to split checks peruse menus place orders make payments and play games</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>suri transformed that thought into e la carte a 15employee company in silicon valley which plans to roll out touch screen tablets at 20 restaurants within the next few months</s>
<s>so far the tablets have been installed in several bay area eating establishments where suri says theyve boosted sales by 10 to 12 by capitalizing on diners impulses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can have the best waiter in the world but theres no way for him to know exactly when you want that next margarita he notes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ehab youssef owner of the firehouse grill  brewery in sunnyvale and palo alto calif has been using e la carte at both of his restaurants locations for several weeks</s>
<s>he says patrons are responding positively though he cant yet tell whether the service has boosted sales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for us the clientele is younger professional youssef says</s>
<s>they want to get in and out quickly</s>
<s>theyre a techie crowd and we of course want to sell more to them like adding bacon to your cheeseburger</s>
<s>its a great arrangement for us</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>venture capitalists think its a smart deal too</s>
<s>e la carte has raised more than $1 million from investors including y combinator sv angel and applebees though the latter has not announced any public plans to use the technology</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even if e la cartes tablets appeal to restaurant owners and investors can the company make money on them</s>
<s>suri doesnt plan to charge restaurants for installing the tablets</s>
<s>instead he says theyll pay a monthly fee usually from $60 to $80 a month depending on how much e la cartes service boosts sales</s>
<s>while thats a bargain for restaurant owners its not much of a revenue stream for e la carte which has expenses of its own developing and maintaining its software the interface for which must be customized for each client and purchasing tablets from a thirdparty hardware manufacturer suri wouldnt disclose the name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and some details remain foggy</s>
<s>suri wouldnt name most of 20 the restaurants that he says are installing his technology in the coming months</s>
<s>he also declined to say how many are already using e la carte and would not disclose the companys current or projected annual revenues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those details are the key to seeing where his company is heading</s>
<s>if e la carte keeps its rockbottom monthly fees and develops no other revenue streams it can only survive by saturating the market and winning contracts at major chains</s>
<s>if applebees  a unit of ihop parent company dineequity din  decides to roll out tablets at its 2000 locations paying some $70 per venue each month in accordance with e la cartes current fee structure that would generate about $17 million annually</s>
<s>conversely 20 standalone restaurants would yield just $16800 a year at that rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and e la carte has competition</s>
<s>tabletop media a company based in dallas offers a similar 7inch tablet called the ziosk</s>
<s>microsoft msft fortune 500 has pitched its surface technology as a potential tabletop menu</s>
<s>and some restaurants are have started handing out ipads instead of menus</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but suri is confident he can make it  and hes risked a lot to do so</s>
<s>a few months after he founded e la carte in 2008 he dropped out of a phdmba program at mit to wait tables and bend industry contacts ears about his new company</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my old classmates were like he dropped out to be a waiter</s>
<s> suri says</s>
<s>and my parents wanted me to be a doctor and stuff</s>
<s>but it didnt feel like a risk</s>
<s>i was just excited</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he thinks diners are ready for something new</s>
<s>the restaurant industry hasnt changed in a thousand years the service experience has been the same since taverns in medieval times he says</s>
<s>its time to shake that up</s>
