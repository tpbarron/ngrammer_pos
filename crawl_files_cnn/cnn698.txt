<s>at its peak apples stock was up nearly 75 for the year</s>
<s>now shares are up just 38 in 2012</s>
<s>of course thats still a good run for most companies  but apple isnt most companies</s>

<s>apple has managed to spook the market recently despite generating record sales of its new ipadsÂ  and while consumers have flocked to the latest iteration of apples tablet reviews from critics have been decidedly more mixed</s>
