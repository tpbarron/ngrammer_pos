<s>the most obvious way is to rethink your standard of living in retirement</s>
<s>swapping the aroundtheworld sailing trip for a caribbean cruise may help you lower your retirement target to a more attainable goal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can also delay your planned retirement date from say 62 to 68 or so</s>
<s>working past the traditional retirement age will let you postpone withdrawals from your retirement accounts</s>
<s>your savings will have more time to grow and youll reduce the number of years youll need to draw on them</s>
<s>working longer may also let you delay taking social security until you reach at least full retirement age 66 if youre 50 today potentially increasing the size of your monthly benefit by 30 or more</s>

<p>
<s>the great thing about online retirement savings calculators is that you can play with the numbers to see exactly how much more or less youll need to save based on when you plan to stop working or how much youll spend in retirement or any number of other factors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>working parttime can help too</s>
<s>but the problem is that you dont know if youll have the interest or energy to work at an advanced age  or if youll have health problems that prevent it</s>
<s>you also may have a tough time finding an employer who wants to hire you in your later years for the amount of money you want to earn</s>
<s>so pinning your entire retirement strategy to working in your 70s or beyond isnt such a great idea</s>
