<s>trying to figure out whether you can afford to retire is like putting together pieces of a financial jigsaw puzzle</s>
<s>first you need to estimate how much youll spend in retirement</s>
<s>then you must consider the income youll collect in retirement from pensions and social security  as well as the amount you can afford to draw from your personal savings or other sources</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the idea is to assemble the various pieces and then see whether the picture of retirement life that emerges is acceptable to you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to help bring the retirement picture into better focus try plugging all your pertinent financial information  including pensions social security retirement investment accounts and anticipated retirement expenses  into an online calculator</s>
<s>the calculator can crunch all the numbers and assess your odds of being able to retire on the schedule you envision</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>revisit the calculator and all the different pieces of the puzzle each year in order to make sure you remain on trackÂ </s>
