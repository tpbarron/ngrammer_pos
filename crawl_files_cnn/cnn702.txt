<s>investors appear to be betting that a second obama term could mean stricter gun control laws  and a rush to buy weapons before that happens</s>
<s>but are the fears rational</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the election is finally over</s>
<s>its not a huge surprise that socalled obama stocks in health care particularly hospitals are rallying while stocks that might have fared better under mitt romney such as coal companies and banks are tanking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there is a rally in one small sector wednesday that may seem counterintuitive at first guns and ammo</s>
<s>firearms manufacturers smith  wesson swhc and sturm ruger rgr both popped wednesday</s>
<s>shares of hunting goods retailers cabelas cab and big 5 sporting goods bgfv were also higher</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reasoning</s>
<s>traders on stocktwits are citing continued fears that president obama may eventually want to push for stronger laws on gun control</s>
<s>and that apparently has investors thinking that nervous fans of the 2nd amendment will rush out to buy guns before it gets tougher to do so</s>
</p>

<s>miningalmanac gun stocks $rgr $swhc up big in preopen $gold  $silver too</s>
<s>so much for efficient markets  obama was a lock but this wasnt priced in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well im not sure obama was necessarily a lock</s>
<s>but it is interesting that smith  wesson ruger cabelas and big 5 all rallied tuesday as well and kept climbing wednesday even as the broader market was in free fall mode</s>

<p>
<s>waljr $rgr just like when people think they cant buy something they stock up on it like never before</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paaresearch its amazing that $swhc might be the biggest gainer today from the obama victory</s>
<s>the obama fear trade in this name continues $rgr</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is a bit curious that these stocks have rallied so hard for such a long time on this premise</s>
<s>just look at how well swhc and rgr have done since election day 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>correct me if im wrong</s>
<s>but its not as if the alarmist concerns about how an obama victory four years ago would lead to tough gun control have come to fruition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im not sure that there will be stricter federal gun regulations given that obama did not win a clear mandate and congress is still split</s>
<s>lets be honest</s>
<s>if the tragedies in aurora colorado and oak creek wisconsin earlier this year  not to mention the shooting of former congresswoman gabrielle giffords in 2011  havent brought the issue of gun control to the forefront its not really clear what will</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with that in mind some traders were also skeptical about how long the gun rally could last</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>raved $cabwont hold these obama gains for long</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>robertweinstein shorting $swhc love the company just overbought from panic buying</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>datagoodies $swhc dont waste your money on election day paranoia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yes the fundamentals for gun companies look strong</s>
<s>analysts are predicting healthy increases in sales and earnings</s>
<s>valuations are reasonable too with swhc trading at less than 11 times earnings estimates for next year and rgr at a forward pe of about 15</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but anytime emotions get in the way of logic a longterm investor should take notice</s>
<s>the gun stocks may be getting ahead of themselves based on fears of a scenario that may never unfold</s>
