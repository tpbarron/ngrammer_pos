<p>
<s>the social security administration just announced a cost of living adjustment cola of 17 for 2013</s>
<s>the increases will take effect on dec 1 2012 and will appear in benefit payments starting jan 1 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cola allows social security benefits as well as federal and military pensions to keep pace with inflation so the buying power of those payments holds steady</s>
<s>its a way of ensuring that retirees can maintain a reasonable standard of living says cristina martin firvida aarps director of financial security and consumer affairs</s>
<s>these adjustments are calculated every year based on increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw a monthly index that tracks the rise in cost of consumer goods and services in selected urban areas</s>
<s>its often argued that the cpiw does not fairly track costofliving increases specific to seniors but thats the index that the government uses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2010 and 2011 the social security administration determined that there was no effective uptick in the cpiw and accordingly declined to implement a cola</s>
<s>this year by comparison saw a cola of 36</s>
