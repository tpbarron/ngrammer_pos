<s>pearls premium founder jackson madnick with his pet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cnnmoney  its hard to imagine anything more innocuous than a lush suburban lawn</s>
<s>thats what 63yearold entrepreneur jackson madnick used to think  until a golf course killed his cat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his cat kitty sickened and died 14 years ago</s>
<s>a groundskeeper at the nearby links told madnick that many local animals had been dying off from chemicals used to treat the grass there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that set madnick off on a mission to find a grass seed that grew easily without toxic chemicals</s>
<s>he spent nearly a decade potting and growing more than 70 different grasses on the deck behind his home in wayland mass</s>
<s>finally he got results a slowgrowing droughtresistant blend of seven grasses that needs no chemical fertilizers little mowing and relatively no water</s>
<s>he named the blend pearls premium in honor of his environmentalist mother</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at first i wondered if i had done something wrong when the grass was growing slower he says</s>
<s>but when he dug into the soil and found the roots extending to the bottom of the pot he was ecstatic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pearls premium arrived on the market in 2009</s>
<s>the seed is now available at home depots hd fortune 500 website and at 60 brickandmortar stores including garden centers and whole foods branches on the east coast</s>
<s>madnick expects his sixemployee company to hit $1 million in sales this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so wheres the splendor in this grass</s>
<s>the roots</s>
<s>according to madnick pearls premiums roots grow up to a foot long reaching deeper for nutrients and water than the twoinch roots of common bluegrass</s>
<s>this means it gets plenty of access to nitrogen and may stay greener in the fall and winter</s>
<s>it also means that homeowners in the northern us will seldom or never need to water it in the drier south it requires watering once or twice a week</s>
<s>newly planted grass requires a month of daily watering to get it established</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because pearls premium grows slowly it requires mowing only about once a month in sunny areas and every six weeks in the shade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this lets people have great lawns with far less impact to the environment madnick says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most lawns after all are anything but green</s>
<s>in california alone homeowners water 10 million acres of residential grass consuming enough water to supply the drinking needs of 40 million households says brett lorenzen a researcher at the nonprofit environmental working group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>americans put 70 million pounds of pesticides and herbicides on their lawns each year he adds</s>
<s>those chemicals get washed into drainage systems and flow into lakes and rivers where the resulting high levels of phosphorous create algae blooms that suck up oxygen killing fish and native plant life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lawns are devastating to our waterways lorenzen says</s>
<s>the impacts are huge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but does pearls premium work</s>
<s>ed lyon a realtor in newton mass met madnick at a local green expo and liked the idea of saving water</s>
<s>so last year he dethatched the existing lawn on his halfacre property and seeded it with pearls premium</s>
<s>he says the fineblade grass that grew in looks nice</s>
<s>its softer and more resilient than his old grass he adds and greener too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we dont really water the lawn anymore and basically its fine lyon says</s>
<s>jackson madnick is a bit of an evangelist a salesman but theres some truth to what he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pearls premium is the only grass seed sold in whole foods wfmi fortune 500 north atlantic region which includes 27 stores says bill mcgowan the grocers regional produce and floral coordinator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were pretty selective about the items we put in the garden center says mcgowan</s>
<s>so far its selling quite briskly</s>
<s>i havent gotten a single piece of negative feedback</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but pearls premium faces challenges</s>
<s>first off it doesnt have the market to itself</s>
<s>nomow lawn seed has been around for years</s>
<s>other ecofriendly grass seeds including ecolawn and pennington smart seed also promise less water and slowgrowing grass</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and not everyone buys into madnicks sales pitch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not new grass says frank rossi a cornell university turf expert</s>
<s>they put grass thats been out there forever and put it into a package and they called it something fancy</s>
<s>its marketing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rossi notes that pearls premium may not thrive in texas southern california and the deep south</s>
<s>homeowners are best off ensuring they have decent soil and a grass that suits their climate he says  and by mowing the grass high they can cut back on water bills</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while madnicks efforts are noble changing consumers minds will be difficult says lorenzen of the environmental working group</s>
<s>he questions whether people will take the time to reseed their lawn and water it each day for a month upfront to cut back on mowing and watering in the future</s>
<s>plus the seed is pricey a fivepound bag that covers 1000 square feet costs $34</s>
<s>the same amount of bluegrass may cost $8 to $27</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pearls premium isnt going to clean the water of the us lorenzen says</s>
<s>changing people is hard and i dont think most people will make the time and money to put it in unless they really hate to mow</s>
