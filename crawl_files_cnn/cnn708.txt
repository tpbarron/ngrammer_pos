<s>of course a stockheavy portfolio can give you some hairraising moments or years</s>
<s>for example during the 197374 bear market us stocks lost 43 of their value  and it took the market threeandahalf years to recoup those losses</s>
<s>the stock market also suffered a 476 decline during the bear market at the start of this decade</s>

<s>if you dont have the stomach for steep downturns you might increase your allocation to include more bonds or bond funds</s>
