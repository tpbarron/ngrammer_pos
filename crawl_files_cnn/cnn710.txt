<s>new york cnnmoney  claims for unemployment benefits fell last week as hurricane sandy led to power outages and closed offices on the east coast and kept many people from filing claims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>about 355000 people filed for firsttime unemployment benefits in the week ended november 3 down 8000 from the previous week the labor department said thursday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that level is the lowest in a month but it reflects data that was distorted by the storm</s>
<s>at least one state was not able to process claims due to power outages a labor department official said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as of thursday morning new jerseys department of labor and workforce development was experiencing delays in processing claims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>due to sandy and the higher than normal volume of unemployment insurance filings the system is experiencing some delays its website said</s>
<s>please be patient</s>
<s>our technical team is working on the problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>claims are likely to head higher in the following week as the storm damage led to temporary job losses</s>
<s>in the hardest hit areas schools were closed for more than a week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>schools alone can cause major disruptions to the initial claims data when theyre closed unexpectedly as contract workers like cafeteria servers janitors and bus drivers can file unemployment claims when theyre not working  even if its merely temporarily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sandy victims can get unemployment help</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the national unemployment rate was 79 in october as 123 million people were counted as officially unemployed</s>
