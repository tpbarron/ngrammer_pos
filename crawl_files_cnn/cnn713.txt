<s>a lab accident sparked the discovery of this blue goos ability to suck up dirt</s>
<s>the gel pours on and peels off</s>

<s>cnnmoney  mopping up radioactive waste is messy work</s>
<s>ever since an earthquake and a tsunami crippled japanese nuclear power plants in march cleanup crews have been struggling to decontaminate the area</s>
<s>typically this kind of work is performed with lowtech tools soap water pads brushes and oldfashioned elbow grease</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>enter hawaiian entrepreneur hank wuh who donated 100 fivegallon pails of his companys hazardous waste cleaner decongel to the cleanup effort</s>
<s>japanese officials are using the cleaner on everything from concrete walkways and parking lots to schools and retail shops both inside and outside of the exclusion zone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>decongel starts off as a liquid that can be brushed or sprayed onto contaminated surfaces</s>
<s>it dries to form a gel that encapsulates microscopic bits of radioactive or otherwise hazardous waste including pcbs beryllium mercury and chromium</s>
<s>the gel can then be peeled off rolled up and thrown away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the discovery of decongel was accidental</s>
<s>wuh is the ceo of a skai ventures a honolulubased venture capital firm and technology accelerator</s>
<s>late one night in 2006 the firms researchers got a little sloppy with an experiment</s>
<s>they were working with a gel that dripped from the lab table onto the floor</s>
<s>when they peeled it off the next morning the floor beneath was absolutely pristine completely clean and white recalls wuh</s>
<s>they tried to scrub the surrounding area to get it to match but couldnt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats when the wheels started to turn wuh says</s>
<s>we knew we had something interesting there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>years of research and development transformed that initial puddle of goo into decongel</s>
<s>in 2009 wuh launched a company called cbi polymers to market and sell the substance</s>
<s>so far its been used to scour everything from shipyards to meth labs to hungarian villages that were inundated with toxic alkali sludge during an industrial accident last year</s>
<s>the company has attracted about 75 clients worldwide including power plants utilities research facilities and hospitals</s>
<s>customers also include the us department of defense and the us department of energy the latter provided funding testing and technical advice</s>
<s>cbi is now working to produce a family of related products with similar properties but different applications including a graffitiremoval polymer coatings to boost the anticorrosive properties of paint and a substance that helps restore the surfaces of historic buildings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one gallon of decongel nuclear decontaminant sells for $160 and covers between 50 to 100 square feet</s>
<s>for about a year starting in 2009 the national energy technology laboratory in albany ore used decongel in a remediation project cleaning lab benches floors tables walls and equipment contaminated with beryllium from research work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although federal officials cant promote one product over another decongel was very effective on metal and concrete says hector rodriguez a program manager for the lab</s>
<s>we reduced the amount of waste water and waste material and we werent worrying about the gel becoming aerosolized or leaching</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>decongel cant neutralize radioactivity  thats the holy grail of cleanup  but it can minimize disposal costs which typically depend on the weight and noxiousness of the waste</s>
<s>radioactive cleanup is traditionally performed with water but contaminated water is heavy and hard to contain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>disposal will always be an issue because we cant make waste disappear</s>
<s>we can only contain it and move it somewhere else wuh says</s>
<s>but with the gel you can fold it or roll it up</s>
<s>it reduces disposal amounts by 90 compared to traditional remediation methods</s>
<s>and because the gel cocoons the contaminated particles it reduces the amount of radiation that can leech back into the environment making disposal less expensive</s>

<p>
<s>andre gonzales president of foothills environmental a hazardous materials remediation company based in golden colo has been using decongel for more than a year</s>
<s>its absolutely an innovation over everything else out there he says because its so easy to apply and remove and it lowers the risk of workers being exposed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>japanese officials found decongel through cham dallas a radiation mitigation expert who directs the university of georgias institute for health management and mass destruction defense</s>
<s>after the quake dallas flew to japan to work on the massive cleanup</s>
<s>he convinced cbi polymers to donate its product to the effort</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ive been doing this for 20 years and theres nothing comparable to decongel out there that i know of today dallas says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the japan earthquake wuh says the entire world is calling us</s>
<s>people want to be prepared whether its natural disasters or terrorism</s>
<s> he declined to disclose sales figures but expects his company to be profitable by the end of this year</s>
<s>business has doubled each year since 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wuh thinks demand for decongel will increase twentyfold in the next few years</s>
<s>that may not be as crazy as it sounds although radiation accidents are rare dallas says awareness of the problem is growing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there have been more meetings on the federal level about radiation dispersals in the environment in the last two years than we have had in the last 20</s>
<s>in addition to aging reactors we also have terrorist threats he says</s>
<s>now with what happened in japan its like the nuclear genie is out of the bottle</s>
