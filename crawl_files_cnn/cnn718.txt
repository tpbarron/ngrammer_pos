<s>xandem founder joey wilson shows off the companys motiondetecting sensor nodes</s>

<p>
<s>cnnmoney  imagine a reallife version of harry potters magical marauders map which showed the location of everyone prowling throughout hogwarts castle</s>
<s>thats what startup xandem is building a new kind of allseeing motiondetection system thats poised to shake up the security market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are many different ways to track motion but most commercial systems rely on optical beams that require uninterrupted sight lines</s>
<s>heatsensing infrared systems dont have that weakness but theyre prone to false alarms and can be blocked by anything that insulates body heat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>xandems secret sauce is its use of radio waves which can go through things like trees and walls</s>
<s>that means motion sensors using those waves can be completely hidden  a breakthrough thats drawing notice from both scientists and security industry professionals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the salt lake citybased company was hatched four years ago at the university of utah when electrical engineering doctoral student joey wilson spied some cuttingedge radio wave research from his advisor neal patwari</s>
<s>wilson who has a background in wireless communications and signal processing offered to team up with patwari</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i thought if i dont jump on this now im going to miss a great opportunity wilson recalls</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pair envisioned a system that would make it possible to see through walls and detect people wherever they were in a building</s>
<s>within a few months they had a working prototype of a node which works in tandem with other nodes to create a field of radio waves</s>
<s>disturbing those waves triggers the sensors detectors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wilson and patwari won the university of utahs 2010 business plan competition then raised $110000 from friends and family to start xandem</s>
<s>they also picked up a utah innovation award and a $40000 grant from a state technology development fund</s>
<s>but by last fall wilson and patwari were largely out of money  until ryan smith an angel investor in salt lake city swooped in with a $250000 investment in the company</s>
<s>a few weeks later the company which now has a staff of six scored a $150000 sbir grant from the national science foundation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>xandems first product which went on sale in april 2011 to early test customers is a wireless motion detection system employing 1x 3inch rectangular nodes that resemble ipod nanos only thicker</s>
<s>the tiny nodes which run off battery power or wall outlets can be completely hidden wouldbe criminals cant disable what they cant find</s>
<s>a massmarket version of the system is slated for release this summer with prices ranging from $600$2200 depending on the size of the deployment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our target is the commercial security market  and thats worth billions says wilson</s>
<s>but being able to see where people are located in a building will be valuable to other markets too like firefighters police border agents and swat teams</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the brahma group a construction firm in salt lake city recently began using the xandem system to protect one of its equipment storage warehouses after two pricey orbital welders were stolen 18 months ago</s>
<s>the xandem system linked to the warehouses alarm system is well hidden with some of the nodes embedded in objects like steel beams or located behind pieces of equipment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as long as the movement is within the network of nodes itll pick it up</s>
<s>its not dependent on a direct line of sight says tony archibald brahmas operations manager</s>
<s>were considering deploying it in our other warehouses too</s>

<s>carey rappaport associate director of the bernard m gordon center for subsurface sensing and imaging systems and a professor of electrical and computer engineering at northeastern university sees xandems lineofsight flexibility as one of its key advantages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can plug a node into an outlet behind your couch and still know if someone comes into the room he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>xandems systems are also starting to pop up in highend homes like the oceanfront penthouse entrepreneur philip charles gamett is having designed in dubai</s>
<s>there its being used for ambiance not security plugged into a home automation system the sensors can trigger responses to cues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it could be the music lighting air conditioning even how the blinds are adjusted says nathan williams of redwood technical services the firm that is handling the installation</s>
<s>our client wanted to be able to detect if someone was in a room but without having that person do anything like press a button</s>
<s>xandem was the only system i could find that was completely invisible</s>
