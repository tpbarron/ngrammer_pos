<p>
<s>your first step is to contact your loan servicer american education services aes to identify what type of loan you have</s>
<s>based on the information you provided aes spokesperson keith new says its likely you have a federal guaranteed loan</s>
<s>if so you may be eligible for two separate loan forgiveness programs the public service loan forgiveness program pslf and the teacher loan forgiveness program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pslf program may forgive the outstanding balance on your student loans</s>
<s>depending on your loan type you may have to convert your loan to a direct consolidation loan</s>
<s>aes should be able to help you with this conversion</s>
<s> you are eligible for loan forgiveness once you make 120 consecutive monthly payments on your loan while working fulltime as a public school teacher</s>
<s>new notes that only payments youve made after oct 1 2007 will count towards your 120payment requirement so if you do qualify it appears you have around five more years to go</s>
<s>for more information on the pslf program go to the department of education website</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the teacher loan forgiveness program can cancel up to $17500 of the remaining balance on your loan</s>
<s>one catch this program is for elementary or secondary school teachers employed fulltime for five consecutive years in qualifying lowincome schools</s>
<s>for more information again go to the department of educations website</s>
