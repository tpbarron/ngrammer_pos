<p>
<s>new york cnn money  the fatherinlaw of academy awardwinning actor forest whitaker may not be as famous as his soninlaw but he is quickly gaining fans among babies and the adults who want to teach them how to walk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jeffrey nashs juppy baby walker has been taking off since he created it in october 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far nash has made $260000 and projects $400000 next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>traditional walkers with wheels have come under fire for injuring or even killing some babies</s>
<s>and some experts argue that the use of them delays motor skills and mental development</s>
<s>parents can opt to hold toddlers hands</s>
<s>but the constant bending at the waist often results in achy backs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the walker is simply a stepin cloth harness with long straps that allows parents to stand upright while guiding and controlling babys steps</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the product is easy to use said danielle leonard a mom and creator of the blog frugalnavywifecom</s>
<s>and it will help kids learn to walk faster and feel better about walking without killing their parents backs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the walker retails for $1495 which has helped lift sales</s>
<s>most consumers have limited disposable income and are extremely price sensitive and value conscious says an industry report from the juvenile products manufacturers association</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nash 56 has a patent pending on the design to help protect his idea and bottom line from competitors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the former mens retail salesman was out with his daughter and her family when he came up with the idea</s>
<s>nash noticed a woman struggling to walk with her toddler</s>
<s>when i saw the woman bent over for some reason the whole design idea came right in my head like it was given to me he explained</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>things moved pretty quickly after that</s>
<s>nash sketched the idea by hand and tapping his retail industry contacts was able to have a prototype sewn</s>
<s>after a few misfires he finally had the perfect sample as well as a connection with a chinese manufacturer</s>
<s>and with about $35000 in startup capital the juppy baby walker was ready for retail in one frenzied month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nash secured about $10000 in startup capital from his father and a friend and the rest came from his 401k</s>
<s>interestingly he did not turn to his daughter and her uberfamous husband whitaker for an investment  or even an endorsement</s>
<s>the juppy is strong enough to be marketed on its own merit he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>angela mickalide director of research and programs for the nonprofit safe kids worldwide agreed that the juppy does alleviate many of the safety concerns of other baby walkers but she warns that there are still risks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the product negates the hazards of traditional walkers primarily because the child is with the parent she said</s>
<s>but parents must still be vigilant in their supervision and store the product well out of childs reach because any string thats more than seven inches long can be a strangulation hazard</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nevertheless support of the juppy baby walker continues to grow fueled primarily by an internet marketing strategy developed by nash and executed by a staffer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nash stays in constant contact with the hottest mom bloggers including leonard who review and give away his product</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i am definitely grateful that i have a product that is actually selling said nash</s>
<s>i just wanted to create something that was simple safe and affordable</s>
