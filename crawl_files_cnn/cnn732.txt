<s>industry veterans insist that almost anyone can master the basics of software coding</s>
<s>now a pair of entrepreneurs have teamed up to test that idea with a company called codecademy which aims to make learning to program simple and fun</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>coding is going to be the literacy of the 21st century and we think we have the easiest way to do it says cofounder zach sims</s>

<s>he teamed with ryan bubinski 22 who graduated from columbia with a degree in computer science and biophysics  and more importantly an extensive knowledge of programming</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>codecademy isnt the first site out there to teach people programming skills but sims says its secret sauce is its focus on making training accessible and affordable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its totally different from books that are oneway learning experiences he says</s>
<s>we think it should be more interactive more fun than something in a book where you read for half an hour and then you go code</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>right now everything on codecademy is free</s>
<s>users receive badges and points for completing lessons</s>
<s>the site currently has four multipart courses available  a coding 101 class and three javascript trainers  but it hopes to ramp up quickly</s>
<s>launched in june the new yorkbased site has already attracted $25 million in a funding round led by union square ventures and is a graduate of y combinator one of silicon valleys most closely watched incubators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sims says his lack of experience as a programmer helped in codecademys creation when we would try a new product out i was the one we would try it out on so it was almost like having your customer build it</s>

<s>miriam browningnance a strategic communications student at columbia university has been using the service to teach herself basic programming skills</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>she moved to new york to pursue a career as an opera singer but quickly found that even an arts career requires some tech savvy</s>
<s>after starting an opera company browningnance had a partner show her how to get into the company websites code to handle basic updates and changes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>she hopes coding skills will boost her resume as she enters an increasingly competitive job market in the communications field</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont plan to become the next great developer she says</s>
<s>i just want to be able to know a little bit  enough to keep communications platforms uptodate and add that little extra something that maybe in a job interview they say oh this person has that extra skill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how is codecademy going to make money off a service thats currently free</s>
<s>like many tech startups its focusing on building first money later</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were not planning to charge for courses sims says</s>
<s>were not really talking much about monetization at the moment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>right now the companys main struggle is the same problem theyre aiming to fix finding developers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hiring is really hard sims says</s>
<s>our biggest problem right now is finding incredibly talented developers and designers to work with</s>
<s>thats sort of why were doing this right now  to create more engineers not just for us but for all the other tech companies out there that are hiring and will be hiring in the future</s>
