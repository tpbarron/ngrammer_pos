<s>cnnmoney  joe rizzi first heard the underwater songs of humpback whales a decade ago while scuba diving near hawaii</s>
<s>enthralled he decided to pipe their migration music into his beachfront home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres the difference between joe rizzi and your average souvenir seeker hes a rich venture capitalist</s>
<s>rizzis quest to capture the whalesong started with a glass pickle jar a hydrophone and a kayak</s>
<s>it ends with liquid robotics a sunnyvale calif company with $22 million from investors 80 employees and customers like bp oil and the national oceanic atmospheric administration</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>liquid robotics operates a fleet of wavepropelled solarpowered ocean robots</s>
<s>designed to capture rizzis elusive music they have the potential to do much more predict tsunamis track fish snuff out offshore oil leaks and patrol waters for national security threats</s>
<s>they use no fuel produce no emissions and can travel up to 2000 miles using wave power alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of that was part of rizzis original plan</s>
<s>the silicon valley venture capitalist planned to retire at his home in kona hawaii after two decades of starting and investing in tech companies like symantec symc fortune 500 and sandisk corp sndk fortune 500 then he heard the humpback whales migrating to alaska</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its an enigmatic sound rizzi says of the songs that became his obsession</s>
<s>the more you listen to it the more captivating it becomes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on a lark he convinced his neighbor to help him transmit the sounds to his home using a hydrophone an underwater microphone a kayak and a cable strung a hundred feet from the shore</s>
<s>but they couldnt hear the whales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rizzi needed to move the hydrophone further into the ocean</s>
<s>his solution a ham radio transmitter inside a pickle jar and a wireless hydrophone hung off a kayak anchored a few hundred yards off the shore</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the police soon showed up</s>
<s>when they found the empty kayak they thought someone had drowned</s>
<s>no humans died but the battery did within two hours</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>about that time rizzi started a nonprofit the jupiter research foundation to study humpback whales</s>
<s>he invited several techie buddies to come stay with him in hawaii drink beer play in the water and help with his whale project</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>together they upgraded his invention with a waterproof case and a motorcycle battery charged via solar panel</s>
<s>still he couldnt hear whales  all he got was a noise that sounded like frying bacon</s>
<s>the group tweaked and tested the electronics for months before locals explained that the noise was tiny snapping shrimp</s>
<s>rizzis device needed to be at least a mile from shore they told him to hear the whales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rizzi tried launching his contraption out to sea but 50 mph</s>
<s>winds and 10foot waves battered the craft</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in spring 2005 three years into his quest rizzi had lunch in california with roger hine the former director of robotics at semiconductor equipment maker asyst technologies</s>
<s>hine offered rizzi a solution how about a floating surfboard powered by a fin 20 feet below the water</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fin would act like a whales tail and propel the craft using the motion of waves for energy</s>
<s>a week later hine made a miniature model that floated inside a fish tank which he presented to rizzi and several others at the jupiter research foundation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here we were six grown men sitting around a fish tank for five hours watching it crash into the sides rizzi recalls</s>
<s>roger had an absolutely unique idea and a design that looked like it might work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a test run of a lifesized version off the shores of hawaiis big island caught the eye of coast guard officials who said they could use one for the agency</s>
<s>as word began to spread rizzi got more phone calls  and soon he and hine knew that this was no longer just a personal project</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rizzi and hine launched liquid robotics in 2007</s>
<s>for the next two years they refined their prototype into a dependable craft they could actually sell</s>
<s>it needed electronics that would work consistently in salt water</s>
<s>it needed to survive severe weather 100 mph</s>
<s>winds and 50feet waves</s>
<s>and it needed the ability to propel itself when there were few waves or none at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was deceptively complex rizzi says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today solar power runs the robots computers which chart a course using gps and collect environmental data with onboard sensors</s>
<s>a cable dangles an underwater glider that looks like window shutters flapping to push the craft forward</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they had inadvertently solved one of the great conundrums  they found a way to harness wave power for propulsion says alan salzman ceo of vantage point capital partners a prominent silicon valley venture firm that invested in liquid robotics</s>
<s>when i saw it i said oh my god this is brilliant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the company has since built 120 robots called wave gliders that can be deployed to collect data for a wide variety of customers including oil and gas companies fisheries and defense meteorology and maritime security firms</s>
<s>traditionally those industries have relied on ships buoys or satellite imagery to collect oceanic information</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none are cheap a ship could cost $150000 a day and sending out a buoy can run $1 million to $3 million</s>
<s>liquid robotics sells its robots for $200000 each or rents them for data collection at $1500 to $3000 per day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you just put it off the dock tell it where to go and a month later its there says dr jonathan berger senior scientist at scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego</s>
<s>his agency purchased two $200000 robots for realtime monitoring of tsunami threats across the globe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the companys biggest challenge berger says will be convincing more people that the technology will be reliable for the longterm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for rizzi</s>
<s>he is not entirely retired still serving as chairman of liquid robotics</s>
<s>but he can finally listen to whales sing from his living room  and he even broadcasts the sounds online at jupiterfoundationorgÂ </s>
