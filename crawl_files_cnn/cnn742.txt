<s>unless you turned an extraordinary profit when you sold your home you probably wont owe any taxes on the sale thanks to a generous irs tax break on home sales</s>
<s>a lot of people are still confused about this says ted sarenski ceo of syracuse nybased blue ocean capital</s>
<s>under the old rules you needed to replace your home within two years to avoid capital gains taxes—and you could only do that once in a lifetime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the taxpayer relief act of 1997 became law however individuals have been allowed to make a $250000 profit on the sale of their primary home or $500000 if youre married and filing a joint return without paying capital gains taxes — regardless of whether they later buy a new house</s>
<s>whats more theres no limit to the number of times you can use the homesale gains exclusion</s>
<s>there are a few rules you need to follow however including a requirement that you must have lived in the home for at least two of the five years prior to the date of sale</s>
