<p>
<s>fortune  in the notsodistant past management transitions at ford motor co were much like the firing squad at a south american banana republic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>henry ford ii abruptly fired president lee iacocca in 1978 by calling him into his office and telling him i simply dont like you</s>
<s> ceo don petersen departed in 1989 after losing the confidence of the board of directors with the bizarre announcement that he planned to repot himself</s>
<s>and chairman bill ford booted ceo jac nasser in october 2001 after months of public disputes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course all of that was an improvement over 1945 when henry ford ii had to practically disarm the thuggish gintoting harry bennett in order to take over the company from his ailing grandfather</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if there were any doubts about the changes in ford f fortune 500 culture wrought by ceo alan mulally they were erased by the news of the latest series of management changes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of being a textbook example of jarring executive moves ford now becomes a business school case study of strategic longterm management transitions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the transformation is largely the result of mulallys ability to inspire personal loyalty due to his transparent and open management style along with the unqualified support he gets from executive chairman bill ford</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more fords amazing little engine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a conference call thursday bill ford blurted out i love alan</s>
<s> while others may not be so demonstrative about their affections the sentiment behind the expression seems to be widely shared</s>
<s>with his radiant and outgoing personality mulally has won over all but the most deeply cynical</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>less obvious in the smooth transition is how it was facilitated by mulallys willingness to remain in dearborn and on the job well past what might have been expected to be his normal sellby date</s>
<s>having amassed a considerable personal fortune and without any family ties to michigan he might have reasonably been expected to depart more quickly for temperate climes</s>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>the changes come at a potential tipping point in fords future success that will determine whether it can continue to build on mulallys reforms or be forced to retreat due to a combination of adverse markets resurgent competitors and its own shortcomings</s>

<s>ford shares are up only 256 for the year vs 276 for general motors gm fortune 500 which has its own problems in europe and north america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so give mulally and bill ford credit for overhauling fords fractious culture and executing what looks like a pictureperfect example of management transition</s>
<s>but dont confuse that with a sign that the new team will face smooth sailing from here on out</s>
