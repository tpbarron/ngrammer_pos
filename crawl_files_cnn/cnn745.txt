<s>yes your wifes benefits can increase when you enroll in social security at age 66</s>
<s>but if she takes spousal benefits in addition to her own benefits the total cant be more than onehalf of your full retirement benefits says kia green anderson a spokesperson for the social security administration</s>

<s>your wife is still eligible for survivors benefits whether you pass away before or after taking social security says anderson</s>
<s>if you take social security before your full retirement age and die your wifes survivors benefit will likely be reduced</s>
<s>and if she takes survivors benefits before she reaches full retirement age her benefits also will likely be reduced</s>
<s>one strategy she could continue receiving her early social security benefits until she reaches full retirement at which point she can then switch to survivors benefits if they are greater than her own benefits</s>
