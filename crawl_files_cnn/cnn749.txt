<s>eagleview founder chris pershing changed how the roofing industry operates with a software breakthrough</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  sometimes one bright idea  and a whole lot of work to implement it  can reshape an entire industry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2006 roofing salesman david carlson vented to his brotherinlaw about his frustrations from climbing onto rooftops and manually measuring to give estimates on repair work</s>
<s>measuring by hand is a tedious process</s>
<s>plus people fall off roofs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>carlsons brotherinlaw chris pershing happened to be a software engineer</s>
<s>he did more than listen pershing set out to build a software program that would literally change the way the $30 billion roofing industry views americas rooftops</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today pershings company eagleview uses aerial photography and 3d modeling to produce ondemand reports for accurate measurements of almost every roof in the country</s>
<s>no ladder no tape measurers and no perilous timeconsuming estimates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>having an eagle view report has become an industry accepted standard says kirk belz a partner at midamerica adjusting services an ozark mo company that investigates claims for national insurers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eagleviews reports priced at $20 to $80 each are now used by around 50000 roofers and almost every single large insurance company</s>
<s>sales are on track to hit $40 million this year up from $14 million three years ago and the 175person company plans to hire another 40 to 50 sales and software people in the coming year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>back in 2006 when pershing first considered the idea of automating rooftop measurements he was sure someone had already invented it</s>
<s>he hunted the internet for software that used photographs to generate estimates but found nothing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so he began experimenting with sites like microsofts msft fortune 500 bing and google goog fortune 500 earth searching for satellite images</s>
<s>what he discovered surprised him aerial photography rather than satellite imagery could provide better pictures and more accurate measurements</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i thought there was certainly a huge opportunity out there says pershing 39</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pershing studied one of his wifes birdhouses staring at the roof from different angles</s>
<s>he took snapshots in his head of those angles and then sketched various viewpoints of the roof</s>
<s>over the next few months he holed up at his computer on nights and weekends developing software that would use algorithms to infer the size shape pitch and area of the roof</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he practiced his algorithms on a few addresses including his own and his neighbors</s>
<s>he even pulled up imagery of pyramids in egypt estimating the height of the pyramid to within a couple of bricks</s>
<s>he got the slope of his neighbors homes almost exactly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the end of 2007 pershing quit his job making software for ultrasound machines and started eagleview in a small rented office outside seattle</s>
<s>he convinced family and friends to invest $200000 into his new venture and set out to buy rights to aerial photographs normally used by states counties and the us geological survey</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when pershing began telling contractors and insurance claims adjustors about his technology they were skeptical</s>
<s>the industry had for decades measured by hand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i thought there is no way says belz the missouri claims adjustor</s>
<s>but once a few big insurers embraced the technology belz and others began to follow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pershing hired tech veteran chris barrow to be ceo in 2008 and changed roles to become chief technology officer</s>
<s>barrow then raised $6 million from investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of the smartest things chris did was step away says roger mcomber an angel investor in dallas</s>
<s>its hard to do but its that team mentality</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today eagleview customers can order reports online or through a smartphone app and can get a pdf report delivered in an hour</s>
<s>a dozen competitors including sites like geoestimatorcom and roofwalkcom offer similar services</s>
<s>despite the competition and the recession eagleviews sales grew at a 200 clip last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>belz the claims adjustor says he can process 25 more claims each day without ever sending an adjustor onto a roof  saving at least 45 minutes per job</s>
<s>it really speeds the day up for adjustors he says</s>
<s>and going onto the roof is one of the most dangerous parts of the job</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the software also produces more precise estimates than workers with tape measurers says james arry housch who owns arrys roofing services inc in tarpon springs fla</s>
<s>instead of handing a customer a piece of scratch paper with some numbers and a business card arrys roofing salesmen give potential customers a professional pdf report</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it sets us apart from the competition housch saysÂ </s>
