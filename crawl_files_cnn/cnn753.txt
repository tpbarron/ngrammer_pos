<s>the coal industry is going through some tough times but president obama is only partly to blame</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  president obama has taken a lot of heat lately for killing the coal industry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mitt romney recently accused him of waging war on coal and last month the owner of a shuttered coal mine in ohio blamed the closure on obamas environmental regulations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the coal industry is indeed facing some tough times and increased regulation is partly to blame</s>
<s>but its woes go beyond obamas policies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cheap gas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the main culprit behind coals current troubles is natural gas</s>
<s>utility companies are increasingly ditching coal in favor of cheaper cleaner natural gas which has hit near recordlow prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres no question with gas prices as low as they are companies want to reap the benefit said richard mcmahon vice president of finance and energy supply for edison electric institute which represents utilities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plus the recession and improved energy efficiency have crimped demand for power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just a few years back coal was used to fuel nearly half the nations electricity generation while natural gas accounted for only about 20</s>
<s>but since the us energy boom brought gas prices down the two sources are now about equal according to the energy information administration</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cheap natural gas looks like the best explanation for widespread coaltogas switching kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners wrote in a recent research note</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related energy to keep booming no matter whos president</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the drop off in coal production has been sharp</s>
<s>rising exports to asia and germany have made up some of the difference but not all</s>
<s>last year about 15 less coal was mined compared to the several years prior said carol raulston a spokeswoman with the national mining association which represents the coal industry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the impact on jobs is harder to quantify</s>
<s>the coal industry is relatively small employing just 86000 people in 2011 according to the bureau of labor statistics</s>
<s>and the obama administration is quick to note that coal employment is at the highest level since 1997 when 89000 jobs were in coal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but raulston says the number does not capture contract workers who she said account for nearly 25 of the workforce and are often the first to get laid off</s>
<s>she said 3500 layoffs have been announced in the last four months alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and in big coal mining states like west virginia and wyoming the effects are amplified</s>
<s>and the debate will also play out in swing states like ohio and pennsylvania which also have sizable coal industries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the long arm of regulation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obamas critics may have more of an argument when it comes to the future of coal production</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>starting in 2015 a rule that tightens the amount of mercury coal plants can emit will kick in</s>
<s>other regulations govern mountaintop mining</s>
<s>both will make coal production and operating coalfired power plants more expensive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the edison electric institute says up to 17 of current coalfired electricity could disappear over the next few years as a result of both continued low natural gas prices and looming regulations</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>some say this is a good thing  obamas environmental protection agency said up to 34000 lives will be spared each year from pollutionrelated diseases from just one of its proposed rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the rules themselves are not obamas doing</s>
<s>most of them stem from the clean air act which was signed by richard nixon and strengthened during the first bush presidency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for his part obama has chosen to implement the rules at a fairly fast and judicious pace</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while a president romney might be able to stall or implement the rules more loosely reversing the regulations is unlikely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>congress would need to pass legislation that changes laws such as the clean air act which would be challenging to do even if republicans win both the house and senate said nitzan goldberger an energy analyst at eurasia group in a recent research note</s>
