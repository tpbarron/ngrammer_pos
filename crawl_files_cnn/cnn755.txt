<p>
<s>cnnmoney  almost all of us have a fantasy object in our heads  a wedding ring the perfect coffee table a oneofakind guitar  wed love to have crafted exactly to our specifications</s>
<s>but where do you find a producer who can bring your vision to life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>enter custommadecom an emerging player in the artisan ecommerce boom</s>
<s>what began more than 15 years ago as a woodworking site has emerged into a thriving bazaar for all kinds of custom projects</s>
<s>its like an etsy where you can customize everything on offer  and its caught the eye of influential investors like google ventures and first round capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres a tidal wave of consumers whore interested in buying specialty items from small businesses but who just dont know how to find makers or quality makers says cofounder mike salguero pointing to an overall us market for luxury goods that tops $178 billion a year</s>
<s>what we do is make the process easy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>salguero and fellow cofounder seth rosen met as boston university undergrads with a preternatural obsession with madetomeasure shirts</s>
<s>if you could get a dress shirt customfitted for you they figured why would you ever buy off the rack</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that philosophy led the former real estate developers to the domain custommadecom</s>
<s>founded in 1996 by a bostonarea furniture maker the site was a marketplace for woodworkers that peaked at a scant 500000 visitors a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>salguero and rosen bought the site in 2009 for $140000 and set out to expand it into a onestop resource for connecting buyers with artists who could execute anything from bespoke cat collars to kitchen renovations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that first year salguero and rosen rebuilt the sites interface and logged thousands of miles traveling to woodworking and craft fairs to expand custommades artisan roster which now includes more than 3500 jewelers couturiers and metalworkers among others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>potential buyers submit project descriptions that range from the precise  a diamondencrusted rapperstyle nameplate say  to the very vague like a white nonwooden desk that snugs into a corner and costs less than $250</s>
<s> then they wait for bids to come in</s>
<s>a typical post generates up to two dozen bids many with renderings and spanning a wide range of price points</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>custommade takes a 7 commission on all sales funded by the seller</s>
<s>the site now sees 3 million visitors a year and handles $2 million a month in transactions</s>
<s>in late 2011 investors kicked in $21 million for an early funding round</s>
<s>that let custommade based in cambridge mass expand to 18 employees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>custommade sets itself apart from mass customization sites like fashionplaytes and craft sites like etsy by keeping its focus on highquality artisans all of whom are vetted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the typical sales price of something on etsy is about $25 ours is $1000 salguero says</s>
<s>our makers are people who do this for their fulltime job</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pittsburgh jeweler paul bierker is a convert</s>
<s>though he had a stable client base finding new customers was a struggle</s>
<s>he joined custommade a year ago and now draws 65 of his income  about $60000  from the site</s>
<s>each morning he browses through all the new projects posted and bids on any that fit his style of work</s>
<s>the sites ebaylike reviews and feedback serve as free advertising</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as my reputation increases my work becomes more valuable he says</s>
<s>the consumer protection the site offers allows buyers to say yes to people like me more easily</s>
<s> hes even in the market for an assistant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>custommade offers a moneyback guarantee on all purchases up to $5000 and its employees moderate disputes though they say few have come up</s>
<s>a creation stories feature encourages sellers to post regular updates including photos about the progress of a piece</s>
<s>that keeps artists accountable and buyers in the loop</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors are bullish about the sites possibilities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we think this has a huge runway to expand into a massmarket product says rich miner a partner at google goog fortune 500 ventures</s>
<s>there are those people already used to getting things custommade</s>
<s>but then theres a much wider market for whom the story of made in america being green will resonate</s>
<s>they dont even know its possible to do what the site allows them to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>miner says he hopes to see custommade partner with bigbox retailers to create custom versions of catalog offerings</s>
<s>but right now salguero says his teams main focus is to keep momentum going by helping artists better promote and appropriately price their work</s>
<s>the site expects to do $25 million in transactions this year generating almost $2 million in revenue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first step is to continue working on convincing people that getting something custom is both a good value and accessible he says</s>
<s>sure you can go into restoration hardware and buy a great bed or go to tiffany and get a beautiful pendant necklace</s>
<s>or you can find someone who can make you one thats just as nice and maybe closer to exactly what youre looking for</s>
