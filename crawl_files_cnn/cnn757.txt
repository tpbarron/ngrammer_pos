<s>smart panties was looking for a solution to keeping her underwear dry and odorfree after gym workouts without the use of panty liners</s>
<s>that got her started on a journey to find the perfect panty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eventually that would lead to the creation of her own line of womens underwear</s>
<s>newnam discovered that there were plenty of undergarments that offered moisturewicking</s>
<s>she also found others that had sprayon odor inhibitors applied to synthetic fabrics which eventually washed out of the garment</s>
<s>however none offered both as a permanent solution</s>

<p>
<s>the daughter of a textile executive and holder of a harvard mba herself newnam started searching for a fabric to suit her vision</s>
<s>she discovered a patent that survived the liquidation of dan river mill a textile company that had gone bankrupt</s>
<s>the patent was for notrace based on the same odortechnology used in febreze</s>
<s>notrace bonds the fibers in cotton fabric with odorabsorbing glucose molecules which form tiny pockets that trap odors</s>
<s>the odors are released only in the washing machine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once the garment is washed and dried the pockets are ready to absorb again for the life of the fabric</s>
</p>

<s>newnam combined notrace with wicking technology which pulls moisture away from the body</s>
<s>as a result she created a product that not only controls odors but holds threefourths of a teaspoon of moisture enough to collect most embarrassing spots or leaks</s>
