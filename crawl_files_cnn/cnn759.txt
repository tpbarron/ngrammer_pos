<s>my wife and i are contemplating home purchases and were trying to determine the best course of down payment ten percent down and pay private mortgage insurance</s>
<s>twenty percent down with the help of a 10 family loan</s>
<s>and would that affect our mortgage</s>
<s> or 10 borrowed from a 401k to make it 20 down</s>
<s>which one costs us the least in the end</s>

<p>
<s>there are pros and cons to all of these options but the best choice is probably a family loan or gift that will boost you to a 20 down payment</s>
<s>youll avoid private mortgage insurance which is an added fee you pay when you borrow more than 80 of a homes value</s>
<s>pmi is more expensive now than it has historically been and its difficult to have it lifted says gloria shulman a mortgage broker in beverly hills and founder of centek capital group</s>
<s>in order to have pmi removed from your mortgage you have to pay down your loan to 78 of your homes value as judged by an appraisal which isnt always so easy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a gift is better than a loan because a family loan will be counted against you in terms of debt load which may make it more difficult to qualify for your mortgage</s>
<s>if its a gift it doesnt</s>
<s>all gifts must be documented by the way</s>
<s>you have to show the source of the gift shulman says</s>
<s>for example your parents accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course if its a loan it also has to be on the books with a term of at least five years and a payment schedule</s>
<s>your family member must also charge a minimum amount of interest to keep it from being a gift according to the irs</s>
<s>currently that rate is pretty low though</s>
<s>as of november it was 089 annually for a loan with a term of up to nine years</s>
<s>for the full current rate schedule go to httpappsirsgovapppicklistlistfederalrateshtml</s>

<p>
<s>a 401k loan is a trickier source</s>
<s>first you have to make sure its possible not all 401k accounts allow it</s>
<s>second you can typically borrow up to $50000 but if you lose your job before youve paid it off youll owe the full balance back within 30 to 90 days</s>
<s>if you cant come up with the cash it will be considered a withdrawal with all the taxes and penalties that come with it</s>
