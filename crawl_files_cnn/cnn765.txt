<s>new york cnnmoney  both president obama and mitt romney want to change the income tax code in big ways</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and for good reason</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it accounts for nearly half of all federal revenue</s>
<s>but tax experts and policymakers say that money could be generated in ways that are fairer simpler and more conducive to economic growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how best to achieve those ends however is the subject of endless debate</s>
<s>an interim step in that debate is just what to do with the bushera tax cuts set to expire this year</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>individual income tax rates they are currently 10 15 25 33 and 35</s>
<s>those rates are scheduled to expire at the end of the year and higher rates will take their place</s>
<s>the increases would affect those who report wage and business income on individual returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would make those bushera tax rates permanent for everyone except those making more than $200000 $250000 if married</s>
<s>for those highincome households obama would preserve the bush tax rates at the low end 10 15 and 25 but raise the top two rates to 36 and 396</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would reduce each of the bushera income tax rates by 20</s>
<s>so the top rate would fall to 28 and the bottom rate would fall to 8</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would also like to repeal the new health reform law</s>
<s>if he succeeds that would mean a repeal of the 09 percentage point increase in the medicare tax on highincome households called for under that law</s>

<s>alternative minimum tax currently unless congress makes special adjustments for inflation to the amount of income exempt from the amt the socalled wealth tax would hit tens of millions in the middle class</s>
<s>making the adjustment is costly getting rid of the amt altogether is really costly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would permanently adjust the amt for inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would abolish the amt</s>
</p>

<s>investment income tax rates longterm capital gains and qualified dividends are currently taxed at 15</s>
<s>interest is subject to ordinary income tax rates</s>
<s>for those at or below the 15 income tax bracket however they have a 0 capital gains and dividend rate</s>

<p>
<s>obama would raise the capital gains rate to 20 and tax dividends at ordinary income tax rates for those making more than $200000 $250000 if married</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would maintain the current 15 investment income tax rate but exempt from taxation all capital gains dividends and interest for those with adjusted gross incomes up to $100000 $200000 for married couples</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given that romney has said he would like to repeal the new health reform law if he succeeds in doing so that would result in the repeal of the new 38 medicare tax on investment income for highincome households which the health reform law created</s>
<s>the new tax is scheduled to go into effect for the first time in 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>carried interest tax rate managers of private equity venture capital and hedge funds are taxed at 15 on the portion of their compensation known as carried interest  which represents a share of the profits from the funds they manage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would tax carried interest as ordinary income meaning rates for fund managers would more than double</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney in the past has said the rate should not be raised</s>
<s>but during this campaign cycle romneys advisers have left open the possibility that hed consider increasing the rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax breaks tax credits deductions and other breaks reduce revenue by more than $1 trillion every year</s>
<s>to pay for lower income tax rates and reduce deficits many breaks  including the largest and most popular  have to be eliminated or curtailed experts say</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama has proposed limiting the value of itemized deductions and other tax breaks such as exclusions for those with adjusted gross income over $200000</s>
<s>today many filers in that group can deduct 33 or 35 of a qualified expense</s>
<s>obama would limit that to 28</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama also has proposed making permanent some expanded tax breaks for the middle class such as one for college costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has failed to specify which tax breaks hed eliminate or reduce to help pay for his proposed tax cuts</s>
<s>he has suggested that he would limit them for highincome filers but has offered no details</s>
<s>economist martin feldstein a romney campaign adviser noted in a recent wall street journal editorial that he would keep all deductions but limit their value to a small percentage of a taxpayers adjusted gross income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>estate tax until the end of this year only estates valued at more than $512 million are subject to an estate tax up to a 35 top rate</s>
<s>barring congressional action all estates worth more than $1 million will be subject to the estate tax at a top rate of 55 next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would reinstate the estate tax at 2009 levels  meaning estates worth more than $35 million would be subject to the tax and face a top rate of 45</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney would repeal the estate tax but preserve the gift tax rate at 35</s>
