<s>the nexus 7 left ipad mini center and kindle fire hd right are all gunning for the small tablet market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the compactsized tablet space  once a black hole for flawed efforts like the blackberry playbook  suddenly looks like the hub of that market</s>
<s>after barnes  noble amazon and google showed that you could craft a quality affordable tablet around a seveninch screen apple responded this month with its new ipad mini</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how do the three highestprofile competitors  the mini googles asusbuilt nexus 7 and amazons kindle fire hd  compare</s>
<s>its not as obvious as you might think</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>screen apple aapl fortune 500 finds itself in an unfamiliar position here behind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ipad minis 79inch screen with a 1024by768 pixel resolution is visibly less sharp than the 7inch 1200by800 displays on the nexus 7 and the kindle fire hd</s>
<s>with the same web page open on all three devices text on the ipad looked just fuzzy enough for me to want to enlarge it slightly while on the two androidbased devices i could keep it asis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>size and weight the mini is the lightest option at 68 lbs but the nexus 7 is only about an ounce heavier</s>
<s>either one should work for standingup use on a train</s>
<s>the added three ounces of the fire hd feel distinctly heftier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the allimportant does it feel good in the hand</s>
<s> category the mini is implausibly but pleasingly thinalmost as if you could snap it in half</s>
<s>its two rivals seem chunky in comparison even though they dont need to make room for a back camera like the 5megapixel hardware sported by the ipad mini</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the fire hd i discovered an extra issue i kept holding it upside down</s>
<s>the placement of its front camera along its long side where your thumb easily hides it in portrait mode deprives you of the usual this end up hint of a lens atop the display</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>battery life apple has done exceedingly well  in my usual test of nonstop webradio playback with the screen kept on the ipad mini ran for 11 hours and 53 minutes  but google goog fortune 500 and amazon amzn fortune 500 are no slouch</s>
<s>in that same routine the nexus 7 lasted 940 and the fire hd made it to 923 in one test and 1027 in another</s>
<s>with typical waking hours youll probably need to recharge before your tablet does</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both ipad alternatives are easier to replenish</s>
<s>the loaner units ive tested each charged slowly off generic microusb cables and chargers</s>
<s>with the ipad mini you need apples proprietary lightning cable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apps apple loves to tout the overwhelming numerical superiority of tabletoptimized apps for the ipad 275000 and counting</s>
<s>but a quantityfirst approach doesnt tell you everything  as apple sometimes pointed out in the late 1990s when the mac struggled for attention from namebrand developers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both apple and google have done well at tweaking their own apps to fill out a tablets bigger screen</s>
<s>googles wisely refrain from trying to mimic realworld calendars or address books</s>
<s>some namebrand developers  evernote facebook fb and pandora p are among them  have made the same effort on both platforms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many others however apparently cant be bothered to revise their android apps</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apples advantage is strongest in apps to create content</s>
<s>if theres an android photoediting app with the style and substance of apples iphoto i havent found it yet</s>
<s>as an android user you can still find yourself waiting for iosonly apps to make their way to googles operating system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fire hd compounds that weakness by using amazons separate appstore instead of googles play store</s>
<s>that leaves fire users with a diminished inventory although there are exceptions amazon has an app for its instant video service on the appstore and on the ipads app store but not on androids play store</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>interface if youre a busy person android will likely be a better operating system</s>
<s>multitasking is faster and more obvious</s>
<s>instead of tapping the home button twice to see a row of app icons tapping the recentapps button reveals thumbnail views of open apps</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>android also does notifications better keeping an active count of which apps have new data for you at the top of the screen</s>
<s>and i like being able to check things like my schedule or email through androids onscreen widgets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apples ios is simpler overall although some traits  like the need to open the settings app to change preferences in most thirdparty apps  take some getting used to</s>
<s>for automatic syncing of music photos and videos from a computer to a tablet ios requires far less tinkering than android</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the fire hd amazons rewrite of googles operating system erases its multitasking and widget advantages</s>
<s>and even more so than last years kindle fire the fire hds interface can feel like one big funnel into an amazon checkout screen from the ads that appear on its lock screen to the customers also bought links on its home screen</s>
<s>opting out of those will cost you $15</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>price yes the ipad mini starts at $329 while the nexus 7 and the kindle fire hd each offer $199 price tags</s>
<s>apple can make a good case that the higher cost of the mini buys you that lighter thinner design two cameras instead of one and a superior selection of tablet apps</s>
<s>it cant readily justify charging twice as much for a storage upgrade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but set those prices aside and think of how youd actually use a tablet</s>
<s>if your answers revolve around reading whether on the web or in ebooks the nexus 7 should be your first choice</s>
<s>if apps outrank text go with the ipad mini</s>
