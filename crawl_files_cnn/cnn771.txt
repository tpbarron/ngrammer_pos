<s>cnnmoney  long after webvancoms legendary flameout in 2001 the online grocers biggest problem never left mick mountzs mind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as employee no</s>
<s>400 at the dotcom he knew that it simply cost too much to fulfill online orders</s>
<s>labor was the killer cost employees had to go pick out products on shelves before they could be packed into boxes and those minutes cost money</s>
<s>that 89 cent can of soup was costing us $1 to get it into the tote mountz remembers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while working at his next job at a consumer electronics company the eureka moment suddenly hit what if products could walk and talk on their own</s>
<s>you could design a completely different kind of warehouse</s>
<s>and you could staff it with robots</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mountz left that job in 2002 to start kiva systems the boston company that would bring that vision to life</s>
<s>today nearly a decade later thousands of kivas bots run around filling orders for the internets alist retailers including staples the gap amazon amzn fortune 500 and crateandbarrelcom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but mountzs jetsonsstyle vision wasnt an easy sell</s>
<s>for the first two years silicon valley investors told him that robots running warehouse floors couldnt be done</s>
<s>a hardware company building robots needed at least $100 million invested just to break even they said</s>
<s>i heard no 50 to 100 times in 2002 mountz says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mountz didnt buy it  so he began networking</s>
<s>his former harvard business school classmates introduced him to executives they knew at the gap dell motorola and jcrew</s>
<s>living off his savings mountz visited those operations slept on friends couches and spent hours following executives around warehouses asking questions until they politely asked him to leave</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he convinced old fraternity buddies from massachusetts institute of technology to help him build a prototype robot</s>
<s>a group of angel investors put $16 million behind kiva systems and in 2004 another friend introduced mountz to ajay agarwal who is a managing director at bain capital ventures in boston</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>agarwal remembers that first meeting with mountz inside kiva systems tiny office in burlington mass where he watched a demonstration of five robots maneuvering a stack of shelves around a room</s>
<s>where other investors saw a bunch of expensive robots agarwal saw a disruptive technology that could transform the $100 billion ecommerce market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this idea was so simple yet so brilliant says agarwal</s>
<s>the market was ripe</s>
<s>ecommerce is not going to go away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bain capital ventures wound up investing $5 million immediately in kiva and then an additional $15 million more over the next three years</s>
<s>but before striking a deal agarwal introduced mountz to people he knew at staples and walgreens</s>
<s>then he watched the inventor present his plan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>kiva systems wasnt the only option for those online retailers</s>
<s>competitors tout conveyor belt systems cart systems and even voicedirected technology to help packers pick products</s>
<s>mountz promised potential customers that his robots would allow them to do two to three times as many orders per hour than traditional warehouse operations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mick was impressive says don ralph a senior vice president at staples spls fortune 500 who listened to one of those early presentations</s>
<s>kiva is not the endallbeall but i thought they had an innovative idea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still convincing online retailers to bet their most vital business operations on a bunch of robots was not a slam dunk</s>
<s>fulfillment is the core of these operations so when we were pitching them they were hearing heart lung transplant mountz says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a startup kit of robots would cost $1 million to $2 million and a large warehouse operation with 1000 robots costs $15 million to $20 million</s>
<s>setting up the software and grid systems inside the warehouse requires six months of planning simulated modeling and testing</s>
<s>then logistics managers must be trained before handing them the keys to the operation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first few customers  including staples moved cautiously setting aside a space the size of a basketball court for kiva robots</s>
<s>eventually they moved to fullscale operations with hundreds of robots</s>
<s>like any technology there were bugs but we never had a crisis says ralph of staples which has 1000 robots working at two of its warehouses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today kiva systems is profitable</s>
<s>backed by $33 million from investors the boston company has 240 employees a list of prominent customers and revenue of more than $100 million according to mountz</s>
<s>he says sales grew 130 last year and that kiva is hiring 20 to 30 people each quarter to keep up with demand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course the infiltration of robots translates to fewer new warehouse jobs</s>
<s>but its not all bad news for workers mountz says kivas system lets retailers double or even triple productivity freeing up resources for other investments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the robots also make for a more pleasant work environment says john ling logistics vice president at crate and barrel</s>
<s>the 50 people who now pack 2000 boxes a day alongside 50 robots at crate and barrels tracy calif warehouse spend their days in a better lit cleaner operation with no noisy conveyor belts he says</s>
<s>the robots eliminate much of the mundane physical labor employees once did to retrieve products off shelves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>customers are also benefiting packages can now be shipped the next day from that operation an upgrade from a system that previously took two to three days to get an order out the door</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the robots are a natural progression ling says</s>
<s>most of this stuff is driven by computers anyway</s>
