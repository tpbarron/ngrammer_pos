<s>candidate george romney standing set a high bar when in 1967 he released 12 years worth of tax returns</s>
<s>his son mitt lower right should follow suit argues tax expert joseph j thorndike</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>joseph j thorndike is a contributing editor at tax analysts and a columnist for tax notes magazine where a longer version of this article first appeared</s>
<s>he is also director of the tax history project at tax analysts which includes an archive of presidential tax returns</s>
<s>the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mitt romney does not seem eager to release his tax returns</s>
<s>hounded by republican rivals he said this week that hell do so in april</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>presumably romney is reluctant to be caught violating the socalled buffett rule president obamas aspirational standard for tax reform</s>
<s>the rule holds that no household making more than $1 million annually should pay a smaller share of its income in taxes than middleincome families pay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the buffett rule may be vague and unenforceable but its good politics so it makes sense for romney to release his returns</s>
<s>all he has to do is look at what his father did as a candidate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1967 michigan gov</s>
<s>george romney set the bar high for tax disclosure by presidential candidates</s>
<s>while running for the republican nomination he was badgered by a writer for look magazine to release his most recent tax return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney refused</s>
<s>releasing a single return wouldnt prove anything he told the magazines senior editor t george harris</s>
<s>it could be a fluke or even a cynical manipulation designed to make the candidate look good</s>
<s>what really mattered was how a candidate managed his personal finances over the long haul</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stumped by his argument harris wrote in the magazine i was not prepared for the move that it eventually led him to make he ordered up all the form 1040s that he and mrs romney had filed over the past 12 years  including those profitable ones when he saved the american motors corp from bankruptcy and became a millionaire on the companys stock options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romneys disclosure was apparently unprecedented</s>
<s>while other candidates had released statements outlining their income assets and other financial data none had ever released his actual returns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romneys tax returns told an interesting story</s>
<s>to no ones surprise they revealed him to be a rich man although not nearly as rich as his son is reputed to be</s>
<s>his adjusted gross income ranged from a high of $56677147 in 1963 roughly $4 million in current dollars to a low of $7848385 in 1966 about $527000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in some years romneys salary at amc provided most of his income but starting in 1960 he began to report considerable investment income</s>
<s>his salary ranged from a high of $200000 in 1959 when he was still an auto executive to a low of $27499 in 1963 when he was governor of michigan</s>
<s> his investment income followed the opposite trajectory starting at a low of $3541 in 1955 but rising to more than $500000 by 1963</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romneys income was impressive but so were his deductions</s>
<s>in particular his charitable contributions made headlines  of the useful not the embarrassing variety</s>
<s>over the 12year period covered by the returns george and lenore romney gave away 23 of their income to charity including 19 to the mormon church</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one year in 1960 they carefully gave away all but $38959 of georges salary and bonus $173125 the magazine noted with apparent awe</s>
<s>of course the romneys still collected $48720268 in dividends interest and capital gains that year so they werent in much danger of starving</s>
<s>but still the gifts were impressive</s>
<s>read millionaires ask congress to raise their taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney paid a lot of tax during the 12 years in question although his average tax rate varied dramatically from year to year</s>
<s>it hit a high of 458 in 1961 and a low of 165 in 1966</s>
<s>over the total period however it averaged 37</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what might mitt romney learn from his fathers experience with tax disclosure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney jr should take a lesson from romney sr and take the risk of public disclosure</s>
<s>he should challenge the buffett rule headon offering up his own romney rule in honor of his father no presidential candidate should be afraid to confront the electorate with the truth no matter how uncomfortable it might be for either of them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in vague terms mitt romney has already flirted with that approach</s>
<s>when pressed by reporters about his use of loopholes romney said i can tell you we follow the tax laws and if theres an opportunity to save taxes we like anybody else in this country will follow that opportunity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats entirely reasonable</s>
<s>and he should go even further</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>who wouldnt welcome excessive candor from a presidential candidate on this issue</s>
<s>it would place the blame for romneys presumably low tax rate where it belongs on congress and the irs</s>
<s>it would end all the distracting chatter about what romney might or might not be hiding</s>
<s>and most important it would make him seem like a standup guy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course it would take a certain amount of guts too</s>
<s>but isnt that something we want in our presidentÂ </s>
