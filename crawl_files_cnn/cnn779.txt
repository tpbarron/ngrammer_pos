<s>new york cnnmoney  just one word chopsticks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>inspired by his asian background an american entrepreneur is turning central georgia into a fastgrowing jobcreating region that makes four million sets of the utensils each week</s>

<p>
<s>jae lee a us citizen originally from south korea says his company is americas only chopsticks manufacturer and exports them to china and japan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lee started georgia chopsticks earlier this year in a town called americus population 17000</s>
<s>he said that his 102 employees cant keep up with demand from hungry asians</s>
<s>as a result he has plans to expand dramatically hiring an additional 800 workers next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apparently theres a huge demand worldwide for chopsticks said americus mayor barry blount noting that the disposable nature of the products keeps the demand strong</s>
<s>you and i use a fork and put it in the dishwasher but i guess if you use chopsticks one time you dispose of them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lees success stands in stark contrast to the general perception that us factories have fallen silent while american stores are glutted with products made in china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but china and japan simply dont have enough wood to produce their own chopsticks while georgias does</s>
<s>lee uses recycled materials from area sawmills as well as the poplar and sweet gum trees that are ideal for making chopsticks and plentiful in the region</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china relies very heavily on imported logs lumber and other wood products said russ taylor president of the international wood markets group in vancouver british columbia</s>
<s>so the chopsticks factory fits rather well into that model</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lee said that none of his chopsticks are purchased or used domestically 100 of what he manufactures is exported</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the demand is so strong that lee plans to add five more factories and may expand beyond georgia</s>
<s>lee said hes considering other states that are rich in lumber such as neighboring florida or alabama</s>
<s>mississippi virginia west virginia michigan and oregon are also possibilities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lee also plans to branch into similar wooden products that hell produce for export</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well go from chopsticks to tongue depressors and toothpicks he said</s>
<s>well export it all to china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lee emigrated from his hometown of seoul to the us in 1986 working in atlanta as a business consultant and scrap metal exporter</s>
<s>his experience in exporting to asian countries came in handy when he founded the chopsticks manufacturer earlier this year in april</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lee decided to start the business when he heard that china has a moratorium on domestic tree cutting to protect its dwindling lumber resources</s>
<s>that moratorium has been in place since 1997 according to taylor forcing china to rely on its timberrich neighbor russia</s>
<s>but russia has ramped up its timber export tax from 5 to 25 forcing china to look elsewhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lee said that no bank would lend to him in the beginning so he raised his first $1 million through the help of family members</s>
<s>after that his business partner david hughes helped him raise another $1 million</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he settled in americus partly because of the cheap real estate but mostly because of its access to raw materials</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they set up shop in an old building owned by sumter county which provided them with a discounted lease said lee</s>
<s>the building was once used as a box factory but had been abandoned for about 80 years until they installed the chopstick making machines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>workers are initially hired at minimum wage said lee</s>
<s>they can get promoted after a 90day trial period to jobs paying nine or ten dollars per hour depending on their skill level he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>blount said the company has had a significant impact on the job market in an area where the unemployment rate is as high as 12</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while we would like higher paying jobs jobs in that range do fill a void in our community said blount</s>
<s>even though it may be a lowwage job any job right now is better than no job</s>
<s>hopefully over time as production increases and things get better those folks will have the capacity to earn more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the rapid expansion of georgia chopsticks and its role as an american exporter to china reflects a wider trend</s>
<s>us manufacturing appears to be strengthening while it looks like chinas economy and its manufacturing sector have hit a speed bump</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the slowdown of the chinese economy has created some concerns that it could eventually affect the us dampening the demand for american products</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but for now the demand for chopsticks seems insatiableÂ </s>
