<p>
<s>you can play angry birds on your phone laptop tablet and tv but how about your livingroom wall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a startup called ubi interactive is developing a technology that utilizes the microsoft kinect to allow any screen  or even a projection on a wall  to become a touchscreen</s>
<s>the softwareandkinect combo senses when a finger touches a surface and allows the user to click drag drop scroll and perform all the expected functions of a touchscreen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that means you can hurl birds at pigs almost anywhere</s>
<s>naturally the worlds most popular game was one of the demos that ubi ceo anup chathoth built into the companys test software</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chathoth worked with microsoft msft fortune 500 engineers at the companys redmond wash headquarters for the past few months as part of an exclusive kinect accelerator program</s>
<s>ubi was one of 11 startups chosen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the selling point of ubis technology is that touchscreens are useful but incredibly expensive  particularly large ones for meeting spaces or instore displays</s>
<s>but many businesses have projectors or televisions already set up in conference rooms</s>
<s>those could soon become touchscreens with a kinect which costs about $150 and ubis software</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>having a large touchscreen handy will become increasingly important as businesses migrate to windows 8 microsofts touchbased operating system</s>
<s>though windows 8 will still work with a keyboard and mouse it enables a batch of new apps and features that work best with touch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ubis technology works well but when its used with a projector the shadows created by your hand can be a bit offputting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it took a little getting used to but with a bit of practice i found that flinging birds across a wall became second natureÂ </s>
