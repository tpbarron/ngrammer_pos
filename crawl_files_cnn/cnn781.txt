</p>

<p>
<s>the bottom line is its very disruptive very painful but at the end of the day these kinds of natural disasters typically dont show up in national economic data said mark zandi chief economist for moodys analytics</s>
<s>there will be a lot of offsetting effects both winners and losers</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>but estimates are that only about half of storm losses will be covered by private insurers</s>
<s>and while the federal governments national flood insurance program will fill in some of the gap for flood losses that are rarely covered by private insurers it wont fill the whole gap</s>
