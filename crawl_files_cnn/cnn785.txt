<s>new voice</s>

<p>
<s>getting a new voice at the table even in an obama administration will help things say economic policy gurus like tony fratto a former senior official in president george w bushs treasury department and white house who adds that hes a fan of geithner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>geithner served his president really well said fratto a partner at hamilton place strategies</s>
<s>but if obama wins it may be fortunate to have a different voice at the table since all the other dynamics are going to be the same</s>
