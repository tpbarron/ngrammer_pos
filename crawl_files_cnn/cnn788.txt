<s>coolchip cofounders steven stoddard left and william sanchez right impressed the judges at mit entrepreneurship competitions</s>

<s>cnnmoney  every time you watch a lady gaga video on youtube or get driving directions on google maps a server farm somewhere is heating up</s>
<s>the more you do online and the faster it happens the more energy it takes</s>
<s>data centers now consume about 2 to 3 of all electricity generated annually in the us thats the same amount it takes to power the state of new york  and demand keeps climbing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but most of the energy data centers use doesnt go directly to running servers</s>
<s>instead its dedicated to keeping them cool temperatures above 75 degrees fahrenheit can cause the chips inside the servers to malfunction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite decades of advances in computer technology the most common cooling strategy for servers hasnt changed much</s>
<s>a radiator sits on top of the servers chips drawing up heat that gets dispersed by a simple fan that branches off to the side</s>
<s>this is an old method  and an inefficient one  which means data centers still have to blast their air conditioning systems day and night just to keep servers working</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats where coolchip technologies comes in</s>
<s>the threeperson company in somerville mass launched last fall and is developing two new highefficiency heat sinks that could reduce cooling costs in data centers by up to 40 according to 28yearold chief executive and mit grad william sanchez</s>
<s>in may coolchip won mits clean energy prize netting about $230000 to fund its efforts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ironically right after we incorporated we had to move the research out of mit  to my garage sanchez says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mechanical fans have been around since the 17th century and theyre seldom improved upon</s>
<s>but the first of coolchips two heat sink models uses a circular aluminum fan that seems straight out of the space age</s>
<s>imagine something that looks like a tiny flying saucer  a disc with fan blades  floating over the heatconducting radiator that sits above the chips</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we manipulated the fluid dynamics to get it to lift and hover sanchez says</s>
<s>the spinning motion keeps it aloft</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sanchez plans to bring his initial heat sinks to market by late next year and to sell them at a retail price of $30</s>
<s>ultimately he hopes to offer a more advanced version  a combination of the current model and another design one devised by mechanical engineering researchers at mit and funded with about $24 million from darpa the pentagons research arm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sanchez and coolchip cofounder steven stoddard 26 met as engineering grad students at mit where they learned about technologies the school was developing with the hope that entrepreneurial students would commercialize them</s>
<s>that project portfolio included the darpafunded heat sink</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>coolchip licensed the technology</s>
<s>its biggest challenge now figuring out how to modify the device so it can be costeffectively manufactured</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats tough because the device includes very small delicate parts says ravi prasher program director at the federal governments advanced research projects agency for energy</s>
<s>a heat sink is a commodity and they have to figure out how to maintain their design yet manufacture at high volume he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neil rasmussen senior vice president of innovation at apc in west kingston ri was one of the clean energy prize judges</s>
<s>it doesnt take much to be a game changer in the heat sink industry he says</s>
<s>coolchips designs are innovative simply because they are smaller and more efficient</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you look at these big power systems rasmussen says the chips in them might be 14inch long and 116 of an inch thick but to get the heat out of them it takes something more than a thousand times larger</s>
<s> when he saw the coolchip design rasmussen says he was shocked that no one had thought of it before</s>
<s>it makes you wonder why people are doing it the same way theyve been doing it since the 1950s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>coolchips heat sinks could also be a boon for gamers who use computers with fast processors</s>
<s>the company is targeting that demographic through online retailers including frostytech and maximumpc and preorders are already coming in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another potential application for coolchips device is drawing warm air away from electric motors which often require impractically large heat sinks to keep temperatures tolerable</s>
<s>i think theres a lot of potential for wide commercialization rasmussen says</s>
<s>to be honest i couldnt find a single weakness in their concept</s>
