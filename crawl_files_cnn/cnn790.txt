<s>new york cnnmoney  mitt romney promises to pay for his $5 trillion in proposed tax cuts so they dont add to deficits  and would do so in large part by curbing tax breaks on the rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he also has promised not to raise taxes on the middle class</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not mathematically possible vice president joe biden said during the vice presidential debate on thursday</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romneys plan would give a big tax cut to the wealthy and hike taxes $2000 for middleincome folks with kids biden added</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paul ryan romneys running mate shot back it is mathematically possible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the country forgoes about $11 trillion in tax breaks a year ryan said</s>
<s>deny those loopholes and deductions to higherincome taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed so we can lower tax rates across the board</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats what the two sides are saying</s>
<s>the reality is far more complicated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>where does the $5 trillion come from</s>
<s>romney wants to cut everyones income tax rates by 20 slash the corporate tax rate even more repeal the alternative minimum tax and make investments taxfree for those making less than $100000 $200000 if married</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the independent tax policy center has estimated that romneys plan could reduce revenue by roughly $500 billion a year on average  or $5 trillion over a decade</s>
<s>of that an estimated $340 billion a year is due to his proposals to reduce tax rates and repeal the amt</s>
<s>related no tax cuts for the rich</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those numbers are relative to how much revenue the country would raise if the bush tax cuts which expire at the end of the year are extended</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how much money could romney raise by curbing tax breaks</s>
<s>it depends which ones he trims and how he does it</s>
<s>romney has spoken of some options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among them capping itemized deductions</s>
<s>hes suggested anywhere from $17000 to $50000 for a cap</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but capping itemized deductions alone wont come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts</s>
<s>all told people who itemized last year saved $147 billion without being restricted by a cap</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another reason some of the most expensive tax breaks are not itemized deductions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the romney campaign told cnnmoney that a deduction cap would be just one part of a broader strategy to curb tax breaks</s>
<s>other elements would include limits on personal exemptions and the taxfree benefit workers get when employers pay for their health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that last one is often the biggest tax break in any given year</s>
<s>in 2014 it will reduce federal revenue by an estimated $164 billion according to the congressional research service</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but romney has flatly ruled out curbing some other big tax breaks</s>
<s>one example is the low capital gains rate which disproportionately benefits the rich</s>
<s>that tax break is forecast to cost $71 billion in 2014</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax and budget experts note that its possible to pay for lower rates without hurting the middle class but only if one is willing to put all the tax breaks that affect higher income households on the table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>would the middle class face a $2000 tax hike under romney</s>
<s>without more specifics its impossible to say how romneys plan would affect the middle class</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the $2000 tax hike assertion that biden made comes from a tax policy center estimate based on certain assumptions about how tax breaks would be curbed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>specifically if tax breaks were reduced acrosstheboard by 58 for households making less than $200000 and are eliminated entirely for anyone making more than that then taxpayers with children making less than $200000 would pay on average $2000 more in taxes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but as the tax policy center and others that dispute its estimates have pointed out different assumptions can lead to a different conclusion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cant economic growth help pay for the tax cuts</s>
<s>yes but its impossible to know by how much</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for one thing it matters how quickly one assumes the economy will grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and tax reform is just one element that can affect the economy</s>
<s>theres no guarantee others might not be working against it when reform is implemented</s>
