<s>new york cnnmoney  apple finally unveiled its worstkept secret the ipad mini tablet on tuesday</s>
<s>the teeny device starts at $329 which leaves some breathing room for rivals cheaper 7inch devices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ipad mini announcement came months after the debut of $199 7inch tablets from amazon amzn fortune 500 google goog fortune 500 and samsung</s>
<s>amazons cheapest offering the kindle fire starts at $159</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those three rivals went for the jugular by undercutting apples original $499 ipad on price  effectively giving customers an option between lowend and highend tablets</s>
<s>tech analysts were watching closely to see if apple would aggressively go after the competition with a much cheaper ipad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple shares were down about 2 after the announcement while amazon and google were up slightly</s>
<s>barnes  noble bks fortune 500 which recently released its $199 nook hd gained more than 6</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before the ipad mini announcement analysts guesses on the tablets price were all over the map generally ranging from $249 to $349</s>
<s>and theyre split on what apple aapl fortune 500 hopes to achieve with the mini which features a 79inch screen</s>
<s>the traditional ipad clocks in at nearly 10 inches</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we see this as apple playing both defense and offense said shaw wu an analyst at sterne agee</s>
<s>theyre defending against 7inch tablets from its competitors plus going after even more potential pc buyers who instead opt for tablets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wu had expected the ipad mini to cost between $299 and $349</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the $329 price for the ipad mini is well above the low end of a target range from deutsche bank analyst chris whitmore who said one day before the announcement that a $250 price tag would be a barnburner especially during this holiday season</s>
<s> still he thinks the $250$350 price point is an underserved market segment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>projections from a group of jpmorgan analysts sorely missed they predicted on monday that the ipad mini would start at $249</s>
<s>the group waved off concerns about margins and possible competition with the ipod touch saying apples overarching focus is on grabbing a bigger share of the overall tablet market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the teeny ipad will appeal to more pricesensitive users and the ereader crowd the jpmorgan analysts wrote on monday</s>
<s>they specifically credited amazons kindle fire and googles nexus 7 with creating interest in smallerformfactor tablets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>amazon and google might have cut the price of their tablets if the ipad mini were cheaper</s>
<s>but now its not clear if they will need to do so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>laura didio principal analyst at research firm itic told cnnmoney in a recent interview that an ipad mini price of $249 or higher would allow competitors to keep their 7inch tablets at $199</s>
<s>but if apple had come closer to the $199 price point amazon  the most priceconscious competitor  could have been forced to drop its kindle fire price by $50 or more</s>
