<s>new york cnnmoney  the most recent polling confirms what both barack obama and mitt romney know that the shape of the us economy remains by a wide margin the single biggest issue facing american voters </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite talk of debt and deficit reduction that has dominated congressional debate for the last two years the subcategory of greatest concern to americans isnt federal spending its job creation </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all of those warnings about how america could easily become like greece arent resonating  what americans seem to want is a president and congress that will work marginally as hard on creating jobs as they seem to do fighting about debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to that end both candidates have made grand and potentially impossible promises </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it started with a claim by the romney camp that a republican administration would result in 12 million us jobs created in 4 years though he provided no details as to how that would be achieved </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the obama administration made the quick calculation that the a lofty unsubstantiated promise trumps the evidence at hand and within days proclaimed the romney pledge a low bar suggesting that that many jobs would be created no matter who was in the oval office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the facts tell a different story  the current rate of job growth in the us is about 2 million jobs a year so both candidates are talking about 50 growth in job creation over the next presidential term  putting aside how much influence a us president can actually have over job creation history provides some context about the relationship between job creation and economic growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related obama may be a job creator after all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s> the us has created 12 million jobs in 4 years 3 times before  the first was during world war two from august 1939 to july 1943 </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more recent history provides us with two examples</s>
<s>the first was from september 1983 to august 1987 during ronald reagans term in office when economic growth averaged 45  the second time was between august 1996 and july 2000 under bill clinton when gdp growth averaged 43</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the us is nowhere near that now and wont be anytime soon the most recent measure of us economic growth from the second quarter is 13 and the highest estimates for 2013 assuming the european doesnt deteriorate further is around 3 much lower than the 4 or higher that history suggests is needed to meet the claims </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>assuming the economy grows faster in the subsequent 3 years of the next presidential term it would still need to grow at a rate not currently projected for either candidates claims to come true</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it would likely serve the us voter better not to be presented with a blue skies version of the future that is unlikely to come to pass</s>
<s>rather a bold candidate may want to suggest that the us economic hole is deep and likely to take considerable time to be filled</s>
<s>it would serve voters further to hear specifics about how a higherthannormal number of jobs might be created  neither enhanced consumer confidence nor tax cuts will likely on their own add 50 to the projected base of job creation </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists on both sides when pressed point to a rebound in us home sales and prices combined with record low interest rates as a potential driver for employment  others suggest a massive infrastructure push but the appetite among us taxpayers for greater government intervention into the economy after the much maligned stimulus of 2009 is small</s>
</p>

<p>
<s> with less than a month to go until the election there will be an ebbandflow in the absolute influence of the economy on voters but concern over jobs have trumped all other issues economic or not for the last 4 years  americans are eager for a plan that will see that concern finally fade into the background</s>
