<s>apple is the most valuable tech stock by far</s>
<s>but is it towering too high above some of its competitors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul r la monica</s>
<s>other than time warner the parent of cnnmoney and abbott laboratories la monica does not own positions in any individual stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>asking the following question may be considered blasphemous to the throngs of mac geeks and ifaithful out there</s>
<s>but here goes are shares of apple aapl finally getting too expensive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple hit another alltime high tuesday coming close to $675 per share before pulling back a bit</s>
<s>the company is now worth approximately $620 billion</s>
<s>thats nearly twoandahalf times the market value of microsoft msft and almost three times what google goog is worth</s>
<s>those two companies are the only tech giants with a market capitalization even remotely close to apple</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so its fair to wonder if apples stock which is up 63 yeartodate has risen too far too fast</s>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>the good news is that apple shares are still reasonably valued</s>
<s>it doesnt have a tripledigit pricetoearnings ratio like cisco csco did in the late 1990s  a time when many on wall street and silicon valley were predicting that cisco would be the first tech to hit a market value of $1 trillion</s>
<s>apples stock is trading at 15 times fiscal 2012 earnings estimates a fair price for a company whose earnings are expected to increase by 22 annually on average over the next few years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but apple is no longer the slamdunk bargain it used to be</s>
<s>the earnings multiple is not just keeping pace with earnings growth it is expanding</s>
<s>when i wrote about apple nearing an alltime high just a few weeks ago shares were trading at 14 times earnings estimates</s>
<s>and when apples share price topped the $500 mark for the first time back in february i noted that the stock was trading for less than 12 times fiscal 2012 forecasts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with the end of apples fiscal year rapidly approaching it will soon be time to look at fiscal 2013 predictions as the best gauge for apples value</s>
<s>on that front apple is not dirt cheap</s>
<s>the stock trades at about 13 times fiscal 2013 estimates</s>
<s>whats more analysts have been cutting their earnings targets for next year following apples warning that its current quarterly earnings will be below estimates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now dont get me wrong investors shouldnt be nervous just yet</s>
<s>the company has $117 billion in cash</s>
<s>its finally using some of that mountain of moolah to pay shareholders a healthy dividend</s>
<s>doing so makes apple a stock that both growthhungry momentum investors and yieldstarved income investors can comfortably own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related apple and cisco show investors the money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and unless the upcoming iphone 5 or will it merely be the new iphone</s>
<s> looks like apples illfated newton from the early 1990s it seems unlikely that consumers are going to suddenly fall out of love</s>
<s>competitors like research and motion rimm and nokia nok may be on their last legs which can only help apple in the long run</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but investors would be foolish to ignore risks</s>
<s>regardless of what happens with the applesamsung patent infringement trial samsung and others that have joined the google android camp have emerged as tough competitors</s>
<s>microsoft which will soon start selling its surface tablet and windows 8 operating system seems to have rediscovered its innovative roots</s>
<s>intel intc is aggressively pushing ultrabooks as an alternative to tablets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple is in a business that requires constant product refreshes</s>
<s>there is no time to rest on ones laurels</s>
<s>as soon as the iphone 5 is out people will start wondering when the next ipad will be released</s>
<s>expect even more questions about when apple will finally reveal the longrumored apple tv product which may or may not be an actual television</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and what happens if another company creates a product that makes tablets look obsolete</s>
<s>just ask dell dell and hp hpq how sticking with pcs for too long has turned out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related now is the best time to trade in your iphone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when apples stock finally does begin to come down it will be because of competitive reasons says david darst chief investment strategist with morgan stanley smith barney</s>
<s>valuations are not stretched</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>true</s>
<s>shares of apple may not be overvalued at $670</s>
<s>as long as the companys sales and earnings continue to shine it could very well surpass $700 $800 and continue its march toward a quadrupledigit stock price and $1 trillion market valuation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the stock is no longer cheap and investors can be unforgiving</s>
<s>the one major negative that comes with being a stock that just about everybody loves and owns is that everybody might be quick to head for the exits if apple ever stumbles  or if investors suddenly decide that its time to dump tech and move elsewhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if you want to own apple dont go overboard</s>
<s>any sp 500 or nasdaq100 index fund will give you substantial exposure to the stock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in case you forgot cisco and microsoft  the company that used to claim the title as the most valuable company ever  are nowhere close to where they were trading more than a dozen years ago</s>
<s>apple isnt necessarily destined for the same fate but theres a saying about history repeating itself for a reason</s>
