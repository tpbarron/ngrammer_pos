<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  microsoft is staging a comeback  and unlikely as this sounds its one apple and google should be worried about</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsofts recipe relies on three key ingredients windows windows phone and xbox</s>
<s>the secret sauce which features a dash of bing and skydrive is still simmering</s>
<s>but microsoft is nothing if not patient and it thinks its trio of core consumer products will blend together in the next few years to form a major new ecosystem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres the big vision whether youre using your tv pc tablet phone or almost any other device that comes along youll be able to accomplish all the same tasks through all the same platform</s>
<s>the form factor will change but the core experience wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people are starting to see the same lookandfeel across the three screens and the cloud says craig beilinson director of microsofts consumer marketing</s>
<s>this is all going to get pretty blurry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a vision shared by apple aapl fortune 500 and google goog fortune 500 but their implementations are fundamentally different</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the linchpin of microsofts plan is windows 8 which is set to launch this fall</s>
<s>the new operating system features touchscreen integration and the interactive tilebased metro user interface which debuted in late 2010 for windows phone 7 and made its way to xbox last summer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that lets windows run  quite well according to early reviews  on a host of new devices including tablets table tops large touchscreen displays and convertible notebooks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft is also baking cloudbased services like windows live skydrive and bing into all of its consumer products</s>
<s>sign in on any device and youll have access to all of your content apps preferences and search history</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple and googles device ecosystems are more fragmented</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple says were in a postpc world</s>
<s>its solution puts mobile devices like the ipad and iphone at the forefront envisioning the pc as a wholly separate device and platform</s>
<s>macs integrate with ios devices but theres a clear schism in apples world view mobile devices are for content consumption macs are for creation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example its hard to build ipad apps on an actual ipad</s>
<s>to run apples xcode developer software you need a mac</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>googles model focuses on the web as the single platform of the future</s>
<s>its a deviceagnostic approach but it requires constant connectivity</s>
<s>once you go offline your connection to googles computing platform vanishes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>right now both are thrashing microsoft in key markets</s>
<s>microsoft has watched apple race past it in media and tablets</s>
<s>google captured search and the cloud and both companies overtook microsoft in smartphones</s>
<s>meanwhile sales of the pc  microsofts bread and butter  have stalled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that puts microsoft in an unusual position</s>
<s>its the underdog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facing an existential crisis microsoft is making radical changes</s>
<s>windows and office have clearly undergone some sort of genetic reengineering he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a lightly veiled swipe at google he added most big competitors dont want the disruption</s>
<s>when you make your money on the status quo you are incented to move slow or not at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft cant afford to move slow</s>
<s>it knows that in five years the pc wont be what it is today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your office desktop will probably still have a monitor a mouse and a keyboard but those are just accessories</s>
<s>as mobile devices get better and faster theyre taking over more of our computing tasks</s>
<s>soon a smartphone  or a tablet  could be your central device</s>
<s>plug it into your desktop dock in the morning then take it with you at night and youll have have an extremely portable allinone computer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the world for which microsoft is building windows 8</s>
<s>it can run everything from a touchscreen app like angry birds to resourceintensive software such as 3d games and video editing tools</s>
<s>that sounds simple but its an allinone approach microsofts rivals have chosen not to pursue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>windows 8 probably wont be an instant hit</s>
<s>its a dramatic change and corporate it departments  windows biggest customer base  are slow to shift directions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats ok with microsoft</s>
<s>its prepared to play the long game devoting years  and often billions of dollars  to cracking the markets it considers critical</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats why it was willing to lose money for so long on xbox which recently became the worlds leading game system</s>
<s>thats also why it is willing to plow billions each year into bing which remains a financial black hole</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were a company that has extraordinary patience says microsofts beilinson</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>patience is great but execution is critical</s>
<s>microsofts mobile track record is littered with some spectacular failures  like windows ce the mobile operating system designed to look and function like windows on the desktop</s>
<s>sound familiar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres signs microsoft has finally learned from its previous catastrophes</s>
<s>its consumer preview version of windows 8 is drawing cautiously optimistic reviews</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cnet reviewer seth rosenblatt calls it the most ambitious operating system ever with a speed and responsiveness that windows has never had before</s>
<s>gizmodo deemed it a daring and brilliant while the telegraph says its microsofts most radical release in a generation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all the reviewers point out a key question mark hanging over windows 8 developer support</s>
<s>the platform will only take off if software makers embrace it as a legitimate third player in the appleandgoogle field</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats why microsoft is throwing everything it has into creating a new ecosystem</s>
<s>it cant afford to be wrong</s>
