<s>paul ryans selection could spark a real conversation about fiscal policy  as long as romney doesnt run from his running mates controversial views and obama engages with them</s>

<s>howard gleckman is a resident fellow at the urban institute and editor of taxvox the blog of the nonpartisan research organization tax policy center</s>

<p>
<s>thank you mitt romney</s>
<s>your choice of house budget chairman paul ryan as your running mate might kick off the kind of serious fiscal debate the nation needs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>depending on how president obama responds such a discussion could set the stage for serious budget and tax reform in 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but lest reformers get too excited the ryan choice could also set back these efforts for years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres how the selection of ryan puts what had been a nasty and issueless campaign at a crossroads</s>
<s>romney must now defend ryans aggressive and extremely controversial tax and budget plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama however has two options</s>
<s>he can follow the gops 2010 playbook where republicans had tremendous electoral success by playing to the publics fear of change</s>
<s>their strategy caricature and demonize obamas health law wholl ever forget those phantom death panels without ever saying what they would do instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama could easily do the same with ryans wellknown and controversial tax and spending proposals</s>
<s>if he does and gets elected by discrediting all those spending cuts budget reform will end up being set back for at least another four years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>or the president could engage ryan and romney</s>
<s>hed still hammer the big changes they propose in medicare the deep cuts theyd make to social safety net programs and their steep tax cuts for highincome households</s>
<s>but unlike the republicans in 2010 hed go the extra step and propose his own alternatives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for instance if obama opposes ryans plan to shift medicare costs from the government to seniors he could tell us how hed control those expenses</s>
<s>and if he cant where hed get the money to continue to pay for them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that would open up an historic debate over both the role of government and how we collect taxes to support those programs we say we want</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the dream of policy wonks everywhere</s>
<s>and most important it might help build a consensus for the winners version of fiscal reform</s>
<s>do voters really support ryans vision of low taxes and small government</s>
<s>or do we want a government that helps the old sick and poor</s>
<s>and if we do how are we willing to pay for it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by honestly asking these questions a serious campaign might give the winner a mandate that could  maybe  break todays partisan gridlock</s>
<s>at least the odds would be better than if the candidates continue doing what they have been doing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>until this weekend romney acted as if he could get elected simply by blaming obama for a sluggish economy</s>
<s>as a result his agenda has largely been a platitudinous black box  a deficit reduction plan that never specified what programs hed cut a tax reform proposal that avoided all discussion of how hed pay for trillions of dollars in rate cuts and a foreign policy agenda entirely devoid of actual diplomatic ideas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama if anything was worse</s>
<s>his campaign was ignoring issues entirely and rather focused almost exclusively on painting romney as a latterday gordon gekko  an avaricious tax cheat whose only contact with real people was when he accidentally bumped into the maid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ryan may change this dynamic</s>
<s>in a recent interview for ryan lizzas terrific biographical sketch in the new yorker ryan talked about the importance of not just criticizing others but proposing alternative ideas i think youre obligated to do that</s>
<s>people like me who are reformminded ignore the people who say just criticize and dont do anything and lets win by default</s>
<s> thats ridiculous</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course ryan is running for vice president not president</s>
<s>and if romney wants him to softpedal some of his more controversial ideas hell have no choice but to do so</s>
<s>romney will try to run on his own less provocative tax and spending plan</s>
<s>obama will blast ryans</s>
<s>if the president stays in full attack mode any hope for serious debate will quickly fade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont know if having ryan on the gop ticket will change the campaigns depressing dynamic</s>
<s>but it wasnt going to change without himÂ </s>
