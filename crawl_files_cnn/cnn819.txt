<s>the purpose of life insurance is simple to make sure that your kids  or other people who depend on you for financial support  will be ok if you die prematurely</s>

<s>contrary to what all too many insurance agents will tell you you almost certainly dont need to have life insurance for your entire life</s>
<s>you need it most when youre a young adult with young kids when you have yet to build up assets that your family can fall back on if something happens to you</s>
<s>if you die while your children are still in diapers wheres the money going to come from to raise and educate them</s>
<s>right life insurance</s>
<s>once theyre grown up you no longer need it</s>
