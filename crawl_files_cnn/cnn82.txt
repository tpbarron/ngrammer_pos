<s>new york money magazine  im in my late 20s and am behind in preparing for retirement</s>

<p>
<s>im happy to see someone so young so concerned about planning for retirement</s>
<s>but lets not get carried away here</s>
<s>if youre still in your 20s its hard to imagine that you could have fallen very far behind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youre at the beginning of your career which means youve got a good 35 to 40 years of working saving and investing ahead of you</s>
<s>so even if youve done nada to date theres no reason to panic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said you dont want to put this off any longer and the best way to get started is to realize from the getgo that the single best way to assure yourself a comfortable retirement is to save as much as you can on a regular basis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats true whether youre behind and trying to get back on track or if youre already on course and want to stay there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately a lot of people are under the mistaken impression that smart investing is the surest route to retirement security</s>
<s>i suspect thats because the financial press spends so much time obsessing about the markets and giving the impression that you can easily boost your returns by deftly shifting your money around</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related maxed out my 401k</s>
<s>what next</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if only it were so</s>
<s>but the fact is that while investing is certainly important increasing the amount you save is a much more effective method of improving your retirement prospects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>speaking of saving it just so happens that the us senate has designated this week as national save for retirement week</s>
<s>if youre into florid legislative language with whereas this and resolved that you can take a look at the actual resolution</s>
<s>but if you prefer to do something more practical to jump start your retirement planning i suggest you do the following</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first get a handle on how much you should be salting away each year</s>
<s>with retirement still so far off theres no way to know precisely how much you need to set aside</s>
<s>but you want to at least arrive at a ballpark figure which you can do by going to our what you need to save tool and plugging in your age salary and the amount youve already saved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when youre further along in your career try a more robust retirement calculator that allows you to get a more customized assessment of whether youre saving enough how your savings are invested how much you expect to collect in social security and pensions and your planned retirement age</s>
<s>for now though a rough estimate is just fine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next make sure youre taking full advantage of taxadvantaged savings options as mitigating the tax bite can leverage your savings effort and help you build a larger nest egg</s>
<s>fortunately this is a message that appears to be getting through</s>
<s>when asked to identify the best retirementsavings vehicles as part of a recent wells fargo retirement fitness survey 71 of the 1000 people polled named a 401k or ira</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related should i quit my job and travel the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>clearly the 401k allows you to put away more bucks  a max of $17500 next year plus a $5500 catchup contribution for anyone 50 or older  plus it has the advantage of automatic payroll deductions and in most cases employer matching funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but with a current annual max of $5000 plus a $1000 catch up the ira can also be a powerful savings tool  and you may even be able to do both</s>
<s>if you can still afford to save after maxing out your 401k and an ira you can move on to taxefficient vehicles like index funds etfs and taxmanaged funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once youve got the savings side of the equation covered you can focus on investing</s>
<s>but your aim here isnt to stuff your retirement accounts with every investment the marketing gurus on wall street can come up with</s>
<s>rather you just want to create a basic diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds keep costs low and rebalance once a year so your portfolio doesnt get too stockheavy during bull markets or overweighted in bonds should stocks take a tumble</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line youve still got plenty of time to bulk up your nest egg and if you follow the plan ive outlined you should have no trouble doing so</s>
<s>but make sure you started now because if you wait too long you really will fall behind</s>
