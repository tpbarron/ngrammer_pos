<s>depending on whether the annuity is fixed or variable immediate annuities can have various drawbacks ranging from loss of purchasing power from inflation with a fixed annuity or high fees with a variable annuity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example a fixed annuity guarantees you a set payment for a long period of time  possibly the rest of your life</s>
<s>but you might live longer than you think</s>
<s>those payments you started getting when you first retired wont change at all and they might seem pretty measly after 40 years of inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a variable immediate annuity might keep your payments from being eroded by inflation  but then again they might not</s>
<s>payments bounce up or down each month depending on the performance of your underlying investments which can make budgeting tricky</s>
<s>and payments can drop substantially over the short term if the markets fall</s>
