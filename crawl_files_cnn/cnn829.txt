<s>an equityindexed annuity is a combination of a fixed and a variable annuity</s>
<s>the marketing pitch usually goes something like this equityindexed annuities give you the best of both worlds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>guaranteed return as with a fixed annuity you get the lowrisk appeal of a guaranteed minimum return usually 2 to 3</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with some upside but as with a variable annuity you also have a shot at higher gains if the stock market rises since an equity indexed annuitys return is also tied to the performance of a benchmark index such as the standard  poors 500</s>
