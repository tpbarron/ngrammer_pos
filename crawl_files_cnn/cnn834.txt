<s>a longevity annuity provides protection against outliving your money late in life</s>
<s>also known as an advanced life delayed annuity this type of annuity requires you to wait until you reach age 80 or so to begin receiving a payout</s>
<s>once the payout begins the annuity provides a guaranteed regular amount of income for the rest of your life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these are usually used as a supplemental retirement investment</s>
<s>you typically would invest just a portion of your retirement nest egg in a longevity annuity  say 10 to 25  and leave the rest in your other retirement accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as with any deferred annuity your money in a longevity annuity grows until you start receiving payouts</s>
<s>the later you choose to begin your payments the larger your payments will be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you die before you begin to receive payments your heirs get nothing</s>
