<s>president obama called on congress to extend the bush tax cuts for one year for everyone except highincome housesholds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  president obama and republicans battled monday over a familiar dividing line the bush tax cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while they disagree over taxing the rich both support extending the bush tax cuts for the middle class for one year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still middle class americans may end up paying more in taxes next year anyway</s>
<s>thats because neither side is pushing to extend the payroll tax cut</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the payroll tax cut is worth 2 of ones wages up to $110100 for 160 million working americans</s>
<s>it was originally intended as a temporary measure for 2011 but was then extended for this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a result a person making $50000 has enjoyed roughly $83 extra a month while someone making $110100 has been taking home an extra $18350 a month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on an annual basis if the payroll tax cut is allowed to expire those making $50000 will pay another $1000 in payroll taxes while those making $110100 and up will pay another $2202</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>revenue from the payroll tax is intended for social security which is a payasyougo system</s>
<s>and at this point the system uses every dollar of payroll tax revenue it gets to pay benefits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the estimated total cost of the payroll tax cut is roughly $120 billion a year</s>
<s>social security is not absorbing that loss however because the treasury department has been replacing the lost payroll tax revenue with money from general funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in reality its doing so by borrowing money thereby adding to the countrys debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so unless congress decides on a new way to fund social security the payroll tax cut cannot go on forever</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed treasury secretary tim geithner said as much before the senate budget committee earlier this year</s>
<s>this has to be a temporary tax cut</s>
<s>i dont see any reason to consider supporting its extension</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course that doesnt mean some in congress wont push for one  especially during an election year in which the economy is weaker than expected</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for now supporters of the cuts are keeping quiet said sean west us director of the eurasia group</s>
<s>they may well wait until after the election to push for it specifically</s>
