<p>
<s>neither obama nor romney likes the automatic spending cuts nor do they support the magnitude of scheduled tax increases</s>
<s>but they differ what they want congress to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  its one of the biggest decisions facing congress what to do about the fiscal cliff  the $7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts that start taking effect next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two major sticking points whether to extend some or all of the bush tax cuts and and how to replace the nearly $1 trillion in spending cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>handled poorly things will be a mess</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>handled smartly  well there likely will be just varying degrees of mess</s>
<s>thats because congress has now left virtually no time to arrive at a thoughtful bipartisan resolution before the changes go into effect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lawmakers are too busy waiting for the results of the november election before theyll address the issue seriously</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so how would the two men vying for the white house in 2013 handle things</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barack obama tax on rich is key</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>like many democrats and republicans the president doesnt like the automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts called for under the socalled sequester</s>
<s>he wants them replaced with a balanced approach to longterm deficit and debt reduction white house spokesman jay carney has said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time the white house budget office said the presidents senior advisers would recommend he veto any bill that seeks to avert the defense cuts while leaving intact the nondefense cuts or fails to ask the most fortunate americans to pay their fair share</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and carney has said obama will veto any package congress sends him that extends the portion of the bush tax cuts that apply exclusively to highincome households such as the top two income tax rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related fiscal cliff to help debt but cause recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the president himself however hasnt used the word veto</s>
<s> instead he has urged congress to work on those things we can agree on  namely to extend the bush tax cuts for the majority of americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>elsewhere obama has not pushed for an extension of another key part of the fiscal cliff the temporary 2 payroll tax cut passed at the end of 2010</s>
<s>but that doesnt mean he wont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well evaluate the question of whether we need to extend it at the end of the year when were looking at a whole range of issues carney said earlier this month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mitt romney give me 90 days</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in an interview with time magazines mark halperin in may romney said that if elected he would rather obama and congress postpone the tax increases and spending cuts for up to 90 days</s>
<s>that would give his new administration and the incoming congress time to address the issues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i would like to be able to deal with these issues on a structural basis on a permanent basis as opposed to a stopgap effort that would require unraveling and reevaluation he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since then the republican presidential nominee has made it clear many times that he doesnt favor the nearly $500 billion in cuts to defense spending over the next decade that are called for under the socalled sequester</s>
<s>indeed he doesnt favor any cuts to defense spending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and hes also made it clear that he doesnt want the bushera tax cuts to expire for anyone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time he has promised to balance the budget in eight years without touching defense or raising taxes</s>
