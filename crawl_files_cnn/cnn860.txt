<s>its electric</s>
<s>tesla shares rose monday on betterthanexpected sales of the model s but some investors arent convinced tesla is a great longterm bet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its been a good couple of days for elon musk and his electric car company tesla</s>
<s>last week automobile magazine named the companys model s as its car of the year</s>
<s> on monday morning tesla followed up that bit of good news with financial results that pleased wall street</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure tesla tsla is still losing money</s>
<s>and it actually posted a loss that was a bit larger than what analysts were expecting</s>
<s>but teslas sales topped forecasts and investors were happy with the companys guidance</s>
<s>shares rose more than 8 as a result</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>teslas stock has been on a wild rise this year</s>
<s>shares are lagging the performance of general motors gm and the rest of the worlds largest automakers which all have electric cars as well as hybrids to cater to the energyconscious consumer</s>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<s>toyota tm for example reported strong earnings monday morning following similarly good numbers from ford f and gm last week</s>
<s>it may be tough for tesla to compete with the giants from detroit and japan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its also important to note that tesla did hurdle a low bar monday</s>
<s>the company issued a sales warning back in september and said that production of the model s was slower than what wall street wanted to hear</s>
<s>unsurprisingly then traders on stocktwits are still divided about the longterm prospects for tesla</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>harryfend bigbuddha $tsla no profits for long time looks like an $amzn of hyped cars</s>
<s>fail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>greenchipjeff positive q3 for $tsla must really be frustrating for electric car doubters httpstkscocda8</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it may be a stretch to call tesla a failure</s>
<s>and any company could do a lot worse than being the amazon amzn of anything</s>
<s>but i get the point</s>
<s>both amazon and tesla look richly valued and are trading more on future potential as opposed to strong shortterm profits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time it may also be unfair to say that teslas results were completely positive</s>
<s>tesla is still losing money</s>
<s>and while sales topped forecasts they were still lower than a year ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related year of the electric car blows a fuse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors seem encouraged that tesla may be able to start ramping up production again</s>
<s>but even fans of musk admit that investors may be getting ahead of themselves until the company can prove its able to produce more vehicles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>slangwise tesla shares are up 2 ahead of the open</s>
<s>loss widens but elon  co say deliveries are ahead of schedule httptcotsjfolmz $tsla</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>missmot $tsla i really hope tesla succeeds and musk becomes the next rockefellercarnegie</s>
<s>how the stock is up tho is crazy</s>
<s>more cars please</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tesla wasnt the only clean energy that was doing well monday though</s>
<s>and at least one trader thinks that the rally in tesla as well as first solar fslr may be wall streets way of predicting the outcome of tuesdays presidential election</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>baselineace mr market seems to be expecting an obama reelection today $tsla $fslr</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont know if id go that far yet</s>
<s>but it does seem safe to assume that alternative energy stocks would get a bounce wednesday if obama is reelected</s>
