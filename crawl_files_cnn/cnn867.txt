<s>new york cnnmoney  the irs has raked in more than $5 billion from offshore tax cheats since 2009 through its voluntary disclosure programs</s>
<s>designed to lure in tax evaders with reduced penalties and the promise of avoiding jail time the programs require offenders to offer up information about their offshore bank accounts and to pay back taxes</s>
<s>the agency launched its first voluntary disclosure program in 2009 and its second in 2011</s>
<s>this january the agency introduced its third program</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far the irs has netted $5 billion in back taxes interest and penalties from 33000 taxpayers who fessed up to offshore accounts under the first two programs the agency announced tuesday</s>

<p>
<s>another 1500 voluntary disclosures have been made under the new program announced in january which is expected to bring in even more money for the agency once it has been collected</s>

<s>we continue to make strong progress in our international compliance efforts that help ensure honest taxpayers are not footing the bill for those hiding assets offshore said irs commissioner doug shulman</s>
<s>people are finding it tougher and tougher to keep their assets hidden in offshore accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the current program is open for an indefinite period and could be closed at any time</s>
<s>taxpayers disclosing offshore accounts are required to pay a penalty of 275 of the highest aggregate balance in their offshore accounts during the eight tax years prior to disclosing the accounts</s>
<s>thats up from the 25 penalty in 2011</s>

<p>
<s>taxpayers with smaller accounts may be eligible for lower penalty rates of 5 to 125 and as in the prior programs taxpayers who come forward through the program are able to avoid jail time</s>
<s>the program does however require tax evaders to fork over back taxes interest and late charges for up to eight years</s>

<p>
<s>tax evaders who dont voluntarily disclose their offshore accounts but are instead caught by the irs risk jail time and penalties of up to 50  or more if fraud is involved  of the total account balanceÂ </s>
