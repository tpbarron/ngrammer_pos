<s>new york cnnmoney  federal reserve chairman ben bernanke headed to capitol hill wednesday to give congress his semiannual report on the economy and what he had to say wasnt exactly rosy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the job market remains far from normal household income is flat and access to credit remains too tight for many people he said</s>
<s>meanwhile rising gas prices are likely to reduce consumer buying power and the housing market remains a drag</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all things considered the central bank is likely to keep monetary policy loose for the foreseeable future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at its last meeting in january the fed signaled that it plans to keep interest rates near record lows until the end of 2014 to help stimulate the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while that policy came under fire from house republicans wednesday bernanke stuck to his guns and fired back</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its arguable that interest rates are too high that theyre being constrained by the fact that interest rates cant go below zero</s>
<s> bernanke said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce</s>
<s> when asked about the job market bernanke pointed to data that shows about 43 of americas unemployed workers have been so for six months or more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the concern in particular is that people who are out of work for six months or more will be starting to lose skills bernanke said</s>
<s>and thats really one reason for urgency to try to get jobs created and try and bring the economy back to a more normal labor market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the feds two main goals  keeping prices stable and maximizing employment  are collectively referred to as its dual mandate</s>
<s>but the central bank is currently succeeding on only one of those fronts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>inflation excluding energy and food is currently around the feds target of 2 a year but the unemployment rate at 83 is still above what the fed considers normal between 52 and 6</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many republicans are concerned with how the feds stimulative policies could trigger a rapid rise in inflation and devalue the dollar</s>
<s>rising gas prices they say could be just the start</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rep ron paul  who often likes to wax poetic about going back to the gold standard  held up a oneounce silver coin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this ounce of silver back in 2006 would buy over four gallons of gasoline he said</s>
<s>today it will buy almost 11 gallons of gasoline</s>
<s>thats preservation of value</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke said he expects rising gas prices to be merely a temporary phenomenon pointing to tension with iran as the main cause</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont think the fed can do too much about price of gas he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bernanke also urged congress to focus on cutting federal debt over the longterm without derailing shortterm growth</s>
<s>he warned that the economy is heading toward a fiscal cliff as the beginning of 2013 brings both massive spending cuts and tax increases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we have a number of measures including both tax increases the expiration of the payroll tax cut the sequestration that comes out of the super committee negotiations bernanke said</s>
<s>all those things are hitting on the same day basically and thats quite a big impact</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal reserve predicts the economy will grow only 22 to 27 this year not much faster than it grew in the second half of 2011</s>
