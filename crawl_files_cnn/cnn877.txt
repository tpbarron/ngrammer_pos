<s>new york cnnmoney  in the era of the smartphone and tablet boom the hottest wireless commodities are airwaves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>verizon vz fortune 500 wireless said friday that it bought wireless spectrum licenses covering 259 million americans for a whopping $36 billion from a consortium of cable companies including comcast cmcsa fortune 500 time warner cable twc fortune 500 and bright house networks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more spectrum means more bandwidth for telecommunications companies to provide voice and internet service to their customers mobile devices</s>
<s>as smartphones and tablet sales have soared over the past several years consumers demand for data has grown exponentially</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spectrum is the raw material on which wireless networks are built and buying the spectrum now solidifies our network leadership into the future and will enable us to bring even better 4g lte products and services to our customers dan mead ceo of verizon wireless said in a prepared statement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but spectrum is becoming a scarce asset as carriers are simply running out of airwaves to cram data into</s>
<s>the federal communications commission has said that a current wireless spectrum surplus of 225 mhz will become a deficit of 275 mhz by 2014 see chart above</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats why the fcc has committed to freeing up 500 megahertz of spectrum over the next decade</s>
<s>but theres a catch that process includes voluntary auctions by a patchwork of television stations across the country that currently hold but arent using their spectrum</s>
<s>many arent willing to give up their valuable spectrum holdings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as that gets sorted out carriers arent just sitting on their hands</s>
<s>att t fortune 500 is seeking to buy tmobile primarily for its spectrum holdings sprint s fortune 500 has inked deals with 4g wholesale providers clearwire clwr and lightsquared and now verizon has purchased a big allotment of cable providers unused spectrum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beyond the cash infusion the deal makes longterm sense for the cable companies</s>
<s>as part of the deal comcast time warner cable and bright house can become wholesale providers using verizons network</s>
<s>that means they can bundle wireless service with their triple play cable internet and landline phone options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these agreements together with our wifi plans enable us to execute a comprehensive longterm wireless strategy said neil smit comcasts president of cable operations in a statement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wireless is a highcapital lowmargin business given the great expenses that go into maintaining and operating a network</s>
<s>since verizon is already doing that it made sense for the companies to sell their spectrum licenses to verizon in exchange for the option to wholesale the service down the road</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with this deal the cable industry tacitly acknowledges that they cannot do wireless on their own said david joyce analyst at miller  tabak</s>
<s>he noted that the move follows the lead of rival cable provider cox which exited its shortlived wireless initiative last month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its also a sign that none of the companies are interested in buying tmobile</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the att bid to buy the fourthlargest nationwide carrier appears to be hanging on by a thread some analysts had speculated that a cable provider like comcast or time warner cable might be interested in stepping in as a white knight</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by selling off their spectrum the cable providers are sending a signal that theyre interested in wireless but not interested in the costs that go into operating a network like tmobiles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to the terms of the deal comcast which owns 636 of the joint venture will receive approximately $23 billion from the sale</s>
<s>time warner cable will take home $11 billion and bright house networks will get $189 millionÂ </s>
