<p>
<s>we could not find a viable business model to become the fifth national wireless competitor said david cohen chief counsel to comcasts ceo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his remarks came wednesday afternoon during a senate antitrust subcommittee hearing on verizons proposed $36 billion wireless spectrum megadeal</s>
<s>under the blockbuster deal announced in december comcast and several other cable companies would cede a sizable bundle of spectrum to verizon vz fortune 500</s>

<s>wireless spectrum the invisible infrastructure over which cellular communications take place is a finite and much soughtafter resource</s>
<s>as smartphone and tablet sales soar wireless carriers are scrounging around for available airwaves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the large chunk held by comcast cmcsa fortune 500 time warner cable twc fortune 500 and bright house networks is one of the last remaining unused nationally available swaths of spectrum on the market</s>
<s>it amounts to an average of 20 mhz of spectrum covering 259 million americans  more or less the amount of spectrum verizon is currently using to deploy its new 4g network</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in exchange for selling the spectrum to verizon the cable company consortium would get the ability to sell verizons service to their customers on a wholesale basis</s>
<s>that would give them a quadplay option tv internet phone and wireless services all in one bundle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the key question for regulators is whether verizons purchase would essentially eliminate a major competitor from the industry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is the last swath of valuable spectrum that will be available for years to come said senate antitrust subcommittee chairman herbert kohl a democrat from wisconsin said at a hearing on the issue</s>
<s>after winning the battle against att t fortune 500 and tmobiles merger are we now about to lose the war</s>

<p>
<s>its critical that this spectrum gets put to use to expand the availability of mobile broadband said randal milch general counsel for verizon</s>
<s>its no secret were in a critical situation as demand is growing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>milch said verizon services more customers per mhz of spectrum than any other company and needs the additional spectrum to remain competitive</s>

<s>comcast came under attack by several senators for the seemingly damning words that comcast chief financial officer michael angelakis uttered in january at a citigroup conference</s>
<s>angelakis said we never really intended to build that spectrum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the word never was unfortunate cohen said because comcast looked at deploying a wireless network as a viable option</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when it became clear that it wouldnt pay off comcast looked at virtually every available wireless partner before settling on verizon he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>verizons rivals  including tmobile which strongly opposes the deal  say the sale would dangerously consolidate power in the wireless industry with verizon and att which are by far the largest two carriers in the united states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some compared it directly to the failed att and tmobile merger which regulators killed off late last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the deal is elegantly contrived and superbly clever but will deliver same insidious impact on wireless competition said steven berry ceo of the rural cellular association</s>
<s>the manipulation of spectrum resources is an effective tool in eliminating competition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by book value the verizoncable deal would actually be larger than the spectrum that would have been transferred in the atttmobile deal according to timothy wu a law professor at columbia university</s>
<s>the deal would also be the single largest spectrum transfer that the federal communications commission has ever considered</s>
