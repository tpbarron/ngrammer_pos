<s>go straight to the source the internal revenue service</s>
<s>form 1040es which you can find on irsgov offers a handy table on page 6 to figure out your tax bracket whether youre a single filer married filing jointly or separately or head of household</s>
<s>for example if you are a single filer with an adjusted gross income between $35351 and $85650 you can expect to be in the 25 tax bracket — at least for this year</s>
<s>with the bushera tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year its anyones guess where income tax rates will be as of january 1</s>
