<s>but tuition was expensive her parents couldnt help much with the then$46000plus in tuition and expenses and she didnt get enough financial aid to bridge the gap</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so during her first semester aiello found herself taking out an $18000 bank loan on which shed owe $6000 worth of interest before she paid back even a penny of it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when i found out someone would give me $18000 without a cosigner i was really excited  until later down the line when i found out how much i was going to owe aiello says</s>
<s>that was probably the biggest mistake i ever made</s>
