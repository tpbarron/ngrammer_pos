</p>

<p>
<s>the supreme court on thursday upheld the mandate to buy health insurance  ruling that the law imposes a tax and not a penalty as originally billed by supporters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance chief justice john roberts wrote for a divided court</s>
<s>the federal government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mandate goes into effect in 2014 and is just one of the provisions that will help pay for the affordable care act</s>
<s>the law will subsidize coverage for low and middleincome americans and expand eligibility for medicaid</s>
<s>the federal government is set to spend more than $1 trillion over the next decade to do so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are also a slew of spending cuts as well as other taxes and fees that will be paid by health sector companies and hospitals employers and consumers</s>

<s>medicare surtax starting in 2013 many individuals making more than $200000 a year $250000 if married will start paying more into medicare</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the health reform law changes the medicare tax in two ways it adds a surtax on wage income above a certain level and it creates a new medicare tax on investment income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some highincome households will only be subject to one of those changes and some will be subject to both</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>starting next year highincome individuals will pay another 09 percentage points on their earned income over $200000 $250000 if married</s>
<s>thats on top of the 145 they currently pay on all of their wages</s>

<p>
<s>new mandate to buy insurance starting in 2014 individuals must be insured or pay a penalty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the amount of the penalty rises annually from 2014 to 2016 and is adjusted for inflation thereafter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2014 the penalty will be no more than $285 per family or 1 of income whichever is greater</s>
<s>in 2015 the cap rises to $975 or 2 of income</s>
<s>and by 2016 the penalty would be up to $2085 per family or 25 of income whichever is greater</s>

<s>thresholds are higher for plans covering retirees and workers in highrisk jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the theory is that the socalled cadillac tax will encourage companies to choose lower cost plans and that will free up money to pay workers higher taxable wages</s>
<s>that in turn boosts revenue paid into federal coffers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>roughly 60 of large employers  those with more than 500 employees  believe their plans would trigger the tax unless they take action to avoid it according to a 2011 survey by mercer a human resources consulting firm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>about half of those employers however dont think they will be able to get the value of their plan below the threshold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while some employers offer highcost plans because generous benefits are part of their attraction and retention strategy others have highcost plans simply because they have an older or less healthy workforce or are located in a highcost area mercer wrote in its survey analysis</s>

<p>
<s>cap on flexible spending accounts starting in 2013 the taxdeductible amount a worker may contribute to a flexible spending plan will be set at $2500 and adjusted for inflation thereafter</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>money contributed to fsas may be used to pay for qualified health expenses but generally must be spent during the calendar year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and in 2011 the law narrowed the list of qualified expenses that an fsa could pay for</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>penalty for misuse of health spending accounts the health reform law imposed a 20 penalty for the use of a health spending account to pay for nonqualified expenses</s>
