<p>
<s>fears that a ban on the weapons might come back under democratic leadership drove gun enthusiasts to buy firearms when obama was first elected in 2008</s>
<s>the most reliable way to track the number of gun sales is via background checks and they spiked after the last election</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal bureau of investigation conducted 97848 firearms background checks on nov 28 2008 according to the national shooting sports foundation</s>
<s>thats the thirdhighest number of background checks ever recorded in a single day</s>
<s>the fbi conducted 127 million background checks during all of 2008 compared to 112 million the year before</s>
<s>theyve been climbing ever since</s>

<s>obama had largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term despite some highprofile mass murders by mentally unstable gunmen in crowded public places</s>
<s>in one of the most notorious mass shootings suspect james holmes allegedly shot at least 70 people including 12 fatally during a july screening of the dark night rises in a colorado movie theater</s>
<s>as part of his fourgun arsenal the selfdescribed joker allegedly used a semiautomatic rifle with a 100round drum which can be legally purchased online</s>

<p>
<s>although recent mass shootings brought the gun debate back to the forefront little has actually been done about it</s>
<s>but during the oct 16 presidential debate the moderator cnns candy crowley asked obama to clarify his past statements about keeping ak47s out of the hands of criminals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and the president answered with his most definitive gun control statement in years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters dont belong on our streets replied obama</s>
<s>and so what im trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally</s>
<s>part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obamas 2012 reelection already had an immediate impact on gunrelated stocks driving up shares of manufacturers like smith  wesson swhc and sturm ruger rgr as well as retailers like cabelas cab and big 5 sporting goods bgfv</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>keane said that future restrictions on these weapons could be tighter than the clintonera ban</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we would fully expect the ban to be more farreaching and more comprehensive and a further infringement of the second amendment rights of law abiding americans he said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but implementing such a ban would be difficult for obama</s>
<s>the bill would have to pass through the republicancontrolled house before it made it to a democratcontrolled senate</s>
