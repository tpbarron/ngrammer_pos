<s>many see us debt as a threat to national security</s>
<s>but they dont agree on what role defense spending should play in deficit reduction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the national debt was not on the official agenda for the third and final presidential debate which focused on foreign policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but both president obama and mitt romney acknowledged monday night what a chorus of former military leaders current administration officials and fiscal hawks have been saying that the countrys debt is a threat to national security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a nation with our current levels of unsustainable debt  cannot hope to sustain for very long its superiority from a military perspective or its influence in world affairs admiral michael mullen former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said last month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the concern if the debt continues to grow unbridled the us government will be constrained in its ability to pay for what it wants to do militarily and diplomatically</s>
<s>and it could limit the countrys leverage with foreign powers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>especially since other countries own close to half of all outstanding us public debt with china and japan leading the list of creditors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you cant be strong around the world unless youre strong at home said lawrence korb a senior fellow at the center for american progress who served as assistant secretary of defense under president reagan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if the bond market doesnt jack up us interest rates wildly interest costs on the countrys accumulated debt could top $900 billion by 2022</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the equivalent of onefourth of todays federal budget  and about $200 billion more than the united states is currently spending on defense annually</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related defense $2 trillion divides obama and romney</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by 2035 interest costs could consume close to 10 of the economy unless lawmakers make policy changes according to congressional budget office estimates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while national security spending is not the primary cause of the countrys debt problem it accounts for about a fifth of federal spending</s>
<s>and many defense and budget experts think the defense budget is filled with inefficiencies and waste that can be curbed without compromising national security if done smartly</s>
<s>no one for the record thinks the $500 billion of acrosstheboard defense cuts scheduled to start next year are smart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more the wars in iraq and afghanistan have been run on borrowed money  more than $1 trillion so far</s>
<s>and the decision to run up that tab was made before the country was hit by the 2008 financial crisis which added considerably to federal deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while lawmakers in both parties agree that debt will be a national security problem they disagree about just what role defense spending should play in deficit reduction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that division is partly evident in the differences between the presidential candidates defense spending proposals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama has proposed spending roughly $58 trillion on the pentagons base budget over the next decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under that scenario defense would account for roughly 11 of total federal spending in 2022  a little below where the cbo otherwise projects it would be</s>
<s>doing so would still leave the pentagon with funding levels higher than they were under president clinton and during the first term of president george w bush</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has set very ambitious deficitreduction goals  hes aiming for a balanced budget by the end of eight years</s>
<s>but he has ruled out any defense cuts as part of that strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact romney is proposing that the pentagons annual base budget be at least 4 of gdp</s>
<s>that means that over a decade hed spend $2 trillion more on defense than obama or more than $16 trillion relative to policies under current law</s>
