<s>new york cnnmoney  the looming spending cuts at the pentagon played a starring role in monday nights foreign policy debate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mitt romney said several times he would not cut our military budget by $1 trillion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at issue are changes to defense spending in president obamas budget as well as the impending sequester that will hit the pentagon starting on jan 2</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for his part obama said his budget isnt reducing our military spending  it is maintaining it</s>
<s> and he added the sequester will not happen</s>

<p>
<s>whos responsible for the defense cuts</s>
<s>both parties in congress and obama approved the sequester</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cuts are called for under the budget control act</s>
<s>the bca which was signed into law in august 2011 was how lawmakers chose to resolve their bitter fight over raising the countrys debt ceiling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the original idea was to pass something so distasteful it would light a fire under lawmakers to finally negotiate a deal to reduce deficits by at least $12 trillion over a decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but a super committee charged with doing so failed</s>
<s>under the budget law the next step was the sequester</s>
<s>the cuts would be evenly divided between defense and nondefense spending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now both parties and the obama administration say the cuts are a terrible idea  largely because they would be arbitrary and mostly across the board</s>

<p>
<s>how deep would the defense cuts be</s>
<s>it depends what you mean by cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to fiscal experts a cut means spending that falls below the level authorized by congress in the prior year  or even spending that stays at the same level because it hasnt been adjusted for inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the budget control act actually called for two rounds of changes to defense spending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first round which is already in effect would not be considered a cut</s>
<s> the bca set spending caps which shaved $487 billion off the pentagon budget over 10 years</s>
<s>but defense spending would continue to grow at the rate of inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney says he would reinstate the $487 billion obama incorporated it into his budget proposal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second round of changes the actual sequester would be a real cut</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>starting in 2013 defense budget authority would be sliced by 94 not including war funding</s>
<s>the cuts to some parts of defense would be higher because obama has exempted military personnel and veterans affairs from the sequester</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in dollars the congressional budget office projects that the pentagons base budget will fall to $491 billion in 2013 down from $554 billion in 2012</s>
<s>thereafter defense spending will grow with inflation</s>
<s>that would save roughly $500 billion over a decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pentagon will still be spending more in 2013 after sequestration than it did in 2006 at the height of the iraq war noted lawrence korb who served as assistant defense secretary under president reagan</s>
<s>related romneys balanced budget pledge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>will the cuts hurt defense</s>
<s>everyone from the top brass at the pentagon to republican critics of the budget control act has said the cuts could result in a hollow force</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the white house budget office has noted however that the defense department would be able to shift funds to maintain critical military readiness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed the operations and maintenance part of the defense budget  the area that most directly affects military readiness  is also the most fungible part</s>
<s>funds can be shifted to what is deemed most important</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a management issue not a readiness issue said gordon adams who was the senior white house budget official for national security under president clinton</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>adams said the cuts likely would be felt most heavily by general service personnel at the pentagon through attrition and furloughs and by service contractors those who provide everything from mess hall services to security guards</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of that means however that the cuts are advisable</s>
<s>after all they only exist because congress failed to reduce deficits in a smarter way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why cant congress just cancel the cuts</s>
<s>easier said than done</s>
<s>lawmakers need to negotiate a deal to avoid the defense cuts and the rest of the fiscal cliff  $7 trillion in tax increases and spending cuts that start taking effect next year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but both parties are still publicly holding the line on their demands</s>
<s>the republicans want to cancel the defense cuts and head off tax increases</s>
<s>the democrats want to increase taxes on the rich before they agree to replace the sequester with more gradual and less arbitrary cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just last week the white house was signaling again that the president would not sign legislation that cancels the cuts but extends the bushera tax cuts for highincome taxpayers</s>
