<s>bond king bill gross says its time for individual investors to get used to a new and slower dance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in his monthly investment outlook letter the founder of pimco and manager of the worlds largest bond fund pimco total return fund pttrx wrote that the age of credit expansion that led to doubledigit portfolio returns is over and the age of inflation has begun</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and that means investment returns from both stocks and bonds will be stunted gross said highlighting that even investment grade bonds are yielding just 175</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the shift comes as both financial institutions and households continue to go through a deleveraging process after having taken on too much debt</s>
<s>thats resulted in slow economic growth and in some countries even recession or depression</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gross also called out the federal reserve and other central banks for the current shipwreck thats led to record low interest rates without the economic bounce they were supposed to provide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a lender will not easily lend money to an obese overindebted borrower  that much is clear  but she will also not extend a check when the yield carry and return on investment is so low that it cannot compensate for historic business model overheads he wrote</s>
<s>when yields are too low and acceptable risk spreads are so narrow that top line interest revenue is increasingly marginalized then lending is at risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in response to low yields gross notes that banks have slowed lending activity and in the process they end up laying off workers closing bank branches and ultimately reduce the rate of lending or credit growth which propelled the global economy so effortlessly over the past century</s>

<s>in this new normal economy gross says lenders are dancing to the blue danube instead of the lindy and investors have to adjust their expectations to match the new tempo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>against that backdrop he urges individual investors to diversify their portfolios based on their age</s>
<s>own more stocks if you are young but more bonds if you are in your 60s like myself he wrote</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he also warns investors to be cautious of investing fees charged by investment advisors mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs</s>
<s>if overall returns are between just 3 and 4 investors cannot afford to give back 100 basis points especially since inflation typically provides a headwind not a tailwind to securities prices  both stocks and bonds</s>
