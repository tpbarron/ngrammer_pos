<s>recent sensational stories about crushing student debt burdens leave the impression that borrowing for college is unwise</s>
<s>the reality is that few students carry enormous debt loads</s>
<s>a recent report from the new york federal reserve bank showed that fewer than 1 in 30 students have debt loads above $100000</s>

<p>
<s>as both researchers and participants in the loan market we state  without hesitation  that borrowing for college is one of the best investments a young person can make</s>
<s>college graduates earn more than other workers</s>

<s>when a small number of consumers suffer the answer is not to upend the entire market but to tighten consumer protections</s>
<s>the mortgage crisis spurred an overhaul of financial regulation</s>
<s>it did not lead us to decry home ownership as not worth it or rally to forgive all outstanding mortgage debt</s>

<s>no undergraduate can acquire $70000 or $120000 in debt when borrowing from the federal stafford loan programs</s>
<s>the caps in these programs hold total debt to $31000 for dependent students and $57500 for older students</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>undergraduates who get deep into debt typically do so through private borrowing</s>
<s>this is where consumer protection comes in</s>

<s>in 2005 congress handed a valuable gift to the private loan industry loans made to students by private lenders were granted the same bankruptcy protection as federal loans</s>
<s>the survival of private loans in bankruptcy proceedings makes them an unusually safe bet for lenders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this creates a classic moral hazard problem lenders extend too much credit to borrowers likely to struggle in repayment since they know the borrowers can never escape the debt</s>
<s>congress should repeal the protection from bankruptcy that it extended to private lenders in 2005</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the overwhelming majority of students debt loads are much lower than what the press reports</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the fed study showed 43 of student borrowers have less than $10000 in debt and 72 have less than $25000</s>
<s>and the college board shows that in 200910 56 of those graduating with a ba</s>
<s>from a public college took out a loan</s>
<s>the average debt of these borrowers after adjusting for inflation was $22000</s>

<p>

<s>paid off over ten years monthly payments would be $217 at an interest rate of 34 the current subsidized rate or $253 if the rate goes up to 68 in july as scheduled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under the graduated payment plan the initial payment would be $140</s>
<s>another policy option would be to allow students to pay this debt over 20 years instead of 10 thereby cutting the monthly bill to just $126 $168 if rates go up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by way of comparison fed data show that the average new car loan is $27000</s>
<s>this corresponds to a minimum monthly payment of $500 assuming an excellent credit score which few students have</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the car loan would have to be paid off over five years no bank will let you spread a car loan over decades because a car has little market value after just a few years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but a college education pays off over a lifetime which is why paying for it over a long horizon makes sense</s>
<s>spread the payments over the lifetime of the asset a basic economic principle that we should keep in mind when designing student loan policy</s>

<p>
<s>college is a good gamble but not a sure bet</s>
<s>federal loans provide some protections payments can be deferred during school and unemployment</s>
<s>but some borrowers cant find a decent job or have medical problems that keep them from working to full capacity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>here the incomecontingent option makes sense with payments capped at 10 of discretionary income as of 2014 and the balance forgiven after 25 years</s>
<s>less than 8 of borrowers choose this option</s>

<s>there are good reasons not to go to college low grades in high school a fabulous job offer from facebook</s>
