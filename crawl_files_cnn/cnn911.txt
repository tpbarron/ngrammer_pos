<s>in the second quarter investors were unimpressed with the trend in gold prices which never rose or fell more than $100 per ounce according to the council</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the lack of a clear price trend generated a mixed response among gold consumers particularly in the investment arena the report reads</s>
<s>while some investors used this pause in the price to add to their investments others chose to liquidate and realize profits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>overall the decline in demand was most pronounced in china and india which together accounted for nearly half of global demand for gold jewelry bars and coins</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chinese investors were turned off by the tepid price action in the gold market while consumers in china were less willing to splurge on jewelry as the economy there slows</s>

<s>in india gold prices in rupee terms rose to a record high as the currency weakened against the us dollar weighing on consumer demand</s>
