<s>if your kid owes anything close to that federal loans provide a few options</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>incomebased repayment</s>
<s>bills are capped at 15 of discretionary income and for borrowers in public service the balance may be forgiven after 10 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>graduated repayment</s>
<s>knocks about 30 off the standard payment the first two years then raises it every two years so that the loan is paid off in a decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>extended repayment</s>
<s>grads owing more than $30000 can stretch loan terms from 10 years to up to 25 years for lower payments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of these choices heather jarvis a lawyer specializing in student loans prefers incomebased repayment almost everybody who qualifies should choose it</s>
<s>it gives the most flexibility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course if your child takes longer than 10 years to pay the loan he or she will foot more interest than with the standard option</s>
<s>fortunately federal loans have no prepayment penalty so your kid can make extra payments anytime</s>
</p>

<p>
