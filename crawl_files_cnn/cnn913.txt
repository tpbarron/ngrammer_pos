<s>new york money magazine  i think i get the idea of taking money off the table when it comes to investments</s>
<s>what i dont understand is when you should do it and how much</s>
<s>any advice</s>

<s>you hear this expression a lot around the investing world usually when people are worried about a possible market setback</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example i recently saw a money manager on tv tell viewers it was time to take some money off the table because he thought that the stock market which had gained roughly 10 the previous three months alone was getting too pricey</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but like many concepts that pass for wisdom in the investing world  dollarcost averaging being a prime example  this one doesnt hold up very well when you really think about it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets say that you take some money off the table by selling $10000 worth of stock from your investment portfolio</s>
<s>unless you actually spend the proceeds of that sale on living expenses or whatever you now have $10000 in cash that has to go somewhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whether you decide to put it in bonds real estate commodities gold or an fdicinsured savings account its still part of your portfolio  and the return you earn or dont earn on that money still counts as part of your portfolios overall performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so you havent really taken anything off the table</s>
<s> all youve done is move $10000 to a different place on the table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i dont make this distinction to be coy or to engage in semantics</s>
<s>i do so because the phrase taking money off the table creates the false impression that its okay to view different parts of your portfolio in isolation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but its not</s>
<s>youve got to look at the big picture because changes you make in one part of your portfolio necessarily affect the whole</s>
<s>and to truly understand the effect of any transaction youve got to consider what that move means for your investment holdings overall  and how any move leaves your portfolio positioned for the future</s>

<p>
<s>if you sell stock and put the proceeds into bonds youve tilted your portfolio more toward the conservative end of the risk spectrum</s>
<s>plow the proceeds into cash and youve moved even more in that direction</s>
<s>more importantly though youve changed the balance of risk and reward in your portfolio</s>
<s>essentially youre saying youre willing to give up more potential gain in return for less volatility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats fine as long as your decision is consistent with your longterm goals and tolerance for risk</s>
<s>but from what i see people who use the phrase taking money off the table arent talking about a longterm strategy</s>
<s>theyre reacting to something going on at the moment such as a fear among investors that the economy will falter or the market will drop</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>combine that urge to react to shortterm issues with the failure to appreciate how moves in one investment affect the portfolio in its entirety and investors who think in terms of taking money off the table can very well end up undermining their longterm investing strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to avoid that possibility i recommend you simply settle on an overall mix of stocks and bonds that makes sense for your situation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre saving for a goal thats decades away you might keep 70 to 80 of your portfolio in stocks even more if youre okay with seeing the value of your holdings bounce around a lot in the shortterm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if youre planning to tap your investments sooner youll want to hold less in stocks</s>

<p>
<s>once youve chosen the right blend for you stick with it except to rebalance periodically  say once a year  to restore your portfolio to its target allocation</s>
<s>if stocks outperform bonds one year you would sell some stocks and put the proceeds into bonds to get back to the right mix</s>
<s>this way youre not letting emotional reactions to market ups and downs dictate your investment strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i can imagine that some readers are now saying wait a minute</s>
<s>isnt rebalancing just another way of taking money off the table</s>
<s> the answer is no</s>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<s>for one thing rebalancing is systematic not based on subjective notions of investments being overpriced or poised for a setback</s>
<s>theres also no false sense that youre removing money from the investment equation when you rebalance</s>
<s>its clear youre taking money from one investment and putting it into another with the goal of maintaining a tradeoff between risk and return in your overall portfolio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally people generally talk about taking money off the table when they have a gain or when an investment has recently soared</s>
<s>with rebalancing its the relative proportions of the assets that dictate action</s>
<s>thus even if both stocks and bonds have a down year you would still rebalance by selling some of the asset that performed better and plowing the proceeds into the one that did worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line forget about this notion of taking money off the table</s>
<s> its misleading and potentially harmful</s>
<s>instead focus on creating and maintaining the mix of stocks and bonds thats right for you</s>
