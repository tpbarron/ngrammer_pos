<s>obama and romney both say they want to tame deficits and the national debt</s>
<s>but they have very different plans for doing it</s>
<s>and budget experts say both fall short</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  whoever wins the presidential election on nov 6 will be under pressure to tame federal deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>president obama and mitt romney werent asked about the subject directly during tuesdays town hall debate but they each signaled that they would try to get the countrys debt under control</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but how they would about that differs greatly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obamas goal is more restrained he wants to keep deficits from growing faster than the economy</s>
<s>romneys aim is to flatout balance the federal budget in eight years</s>
<s>related the candidates and the fiscal cliff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately budget experts say both candidates plans fall short</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obamas numbers are more realistic but they dont get us very far said robert bixby who runs the concord coalition a deficit watchdog group</s>
<s>romneys numbers get us a long way but they arent very realistic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama stop debt growing faster than gdp the presidents proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 would reduce annual deficits to below 3 of the size of the economy after a few years</s>
<s>the deficit this year is projected to be about 7</s>
<s>obama is trying to achieve whats called primary budget balance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that means all federal spending  except interest owed on the countrys debt  would be paid for by federal revenue</s>
<s>it also means annual deficits would no longer be growing faster than the economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from 2020 through 2022 obamas budget proposals would stabilize the debt held by the public at 76 of gdp according to an analysis by the congressional budget office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a necessary first step in making the budget sustainable but independent fiscal hawks would prefer the debt be stabilized at a lower level</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the next decade obamas budget would rack up $64 trillion in deficits  below the $10 trillion that would accrue if todays policies were extended</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>obama would achieve his deficit savings on both the spending and revenue sides of the ledger</s>
<s>he would also incorporate many of the spending caps established in the budget control act the 2011 compromise law that resolved the debt ceiling crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a result discretionary spending as a share of the economy would fall to the lowest level in 50 years but overall spending would average 225 over the next decade</s>
<s>thats below where its been in the past few years but above the historical average of 208</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after the first decade however the presidents budget would not constrain the growth in debt because his budget does not include broad reforms to medicare  which is one of the biggest drivers of the countrys debt over the long term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beyond 2022  the fiscal position gradually deteriorates mainly because of the aging of the population and the high continuing cost of the governments health programs the white house budget office noted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related $3500 fiscal cliff tax hit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney cut cap and balance just how big of an effect romneys economic proposals would have on deficits depend on details he has yet to offer and on how much economic growth his plans would generate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>broadly the gop nominee wants to cut both tax rates and spending while reforming the tax code and entitlement programs</s>
<s>that combination his economic advisers and others say could spur economic growth</s>
<s>that in turn could generate new revenue which helps reduce deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>specifically romney has promised to cap government spending at 20 of gdp and balance the budget by 2020</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he has ruled out raising taxes so he would achieve these goals by cutting spending although not on defense</s>
<s>indeed by some estimates he would increase defense spending by more than $2 trillion over a decade relative to what obama has proposed and by more than $16 trillion relative to policies under current law  an increase he has promised to pay for with other spending cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at a minimum then to balance the budget he might need to cut funding nearly in half across many areas of government by 2020</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the revenue side romney has promised to cut todays income tax rates by 20 repeal the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax and make investment income tax free for those earning less than $200000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>romney has promised to pay for those changes through higher economic growth and by curbing tax breaks</s>
<s>this week he mentioned that one way to rein in tax breaks is to cap the amount in itemized deductions at no more than $17000</s>
<s>its unclear without more details how much revenue such a proposal would raise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>without offsets his tax plan could reduce revenue by $5 trillion over a decade according to tax policy center estimates</s>
<s>so thats the hole he would need to fill just to ensure his tax changes dont increase deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the committee for a responsible federal budget estimates that even if romney accomplishes that his economic plan would still leave debt as a percentage of gdp around 85 at the end of the decade</s>
