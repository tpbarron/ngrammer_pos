<s>new york cnnmoney  more than half of the worlds smartphones run android</s>
<s>that sounds like a pretty comfy perch for google but its a precarious one  and the historical tides that made android such a stunning success are starting to swing in the opposite direction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on wednesday google goog fortune 500 is slated to unveil the latest version of android at its developers conference</s>
<s>expect some victory laps</s>
<s>the fouryearold mobile operating system is the center of a thriving ecosystem and google has seamlessly integrated most of its key products into android including search gmail chrome maps voice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that gives google a prime position in the fastgrowing mobile realm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but androids success is partially accidental</s>
<s>the software only took off when verizon wireless released the motorola droid in late 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>verizon vz fortune 500 needed a weapon to counter atts thenexclusive deal with apple</s>
<s>it threw all its weight behind the droid which was the first true iphone competitor on the nations most popular phone network</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>kickstarted by verizon android went on to become a strong iphone alternative for virtually all other hardware makers and wireless carriers</s>
<s>googles mobile os held a 59 share of the smartphone market as of last quarter idc analysts said</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>androids climb is about to end idc thinks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>androids smartphone market share will peak this year at about 62 before slowly declining over the next five years the research group predicted earlier this month</s>
<s>though android is expected to remain dominant idc believes that competitors like the iphone and microsofts windows phone will chip away at androids stranglehold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>analysts forecasts are often laughably wrong  four years ago no one expected google to be a mobile phone power player  but this time google has cause to be nervous</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple aapl fortune 500 googles mobile archnemesis is leading the assault on androids empire</s>
<s>the iphone accounted for roughly half of verizons smartphone sales last quarter and more than threequarters of atts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but apple is now coming at android in the fastgrowing prepaid market as well where google had long been the only smartphone player</s>
<s>leap wireless leap cricket and sprints s fortune 500 virgin mobile both announced this month that they will offer the iphone on their prepaid services</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plus googles partners  the same handset makers that catapulted android into the spotlight  have new reasons to be wary of their ally</s>
<s>google completed its acquisition of motorola mobility a month ago putting it into direct competition with its partners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google swears it will play nicely but the saberrattling has already started</s>
<s>samsungs new ceo kwon ohhyun hinted last week that he would like samsung to be more in control of its own destiny</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in his inaugural speech to his new staff kwon called for a focus on creating new customer experiences and on strengthening soft capabilities in software user experience design and solutions according to a wall street journal report</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a spokesman from google declined to comment for this story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the uncertainty google faces in the smartphone space is nothing compared to the giant question mark surrounding its tablet initiative</s>
<s>the ipad will account for 62 of the worlds tablets this year idc estimates compared to 36 for android</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a trend heading in the wrong direction</s>
<s>last year android held 38 of the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsofts msft fortune 500 surface tablet coming this fall is a fresh threat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so in a way is the amazon amzn fortune 500 kindle fire which sold well during the holidays and is the only rival tablet to make any headway against the marketleading ipad</s>
<s>it runs a heavily customized version of the opensource android software and it steers users toward amazons own app store  not googles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thanks to customers sluggish android adoption software developers havent exactly embraced googles tablet initiative</s>
<s>there are 225000 apps specifically designed for the ipad but there are so few tabletspecific apps for android that google doesnt even make the number available</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that causes a chickenandegg problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apps are key to tablet users which is why we have not seen great hardware from asus and samsung sell in big volumes so far said carolina milanesi analyst at gartner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google has tried to fix some of androids problems</s>
<s>it developed a much more featurerich and dynamic version of android called ice cream sandwich that works the same on tablets and smartphones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but only 7 of android users are actually using ics six months after it was released to the public</s>
<s>carriers like verizon and att often wait many months before deploying updates to their customers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google is widely expected to unveil a new tablet of its own design this week a move aimed at catalyzing androids growth</s>
<s>the wall street journal also reported recently that google is hatching plans to directly sell unlocked android smartphones on its website which will will work on any carrier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google will unveil jelly bean the next version of android this week</s>
<s>it will show off some flashy advancements in the software and attempt to trump apple and microsofts recent improvements to their own mobile operating systems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of those moves  new devices new sales channels new software  will matter if androids rivals stop its momentum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>up to now android has benefited from the fact that if you wanted an alternative to iphone there was nothing else said gartners milanesi</s>
<s>things are changing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>are androids capable of fearÂ </s>
