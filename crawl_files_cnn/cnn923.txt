<s>the average tax hit $11 million per employee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats a very rough estimate based on facebooks roster of just over 3500 employees and its recent disclosure that it plans to set aside an eyepopping $4 billion to cover tax bills this year</s>
<s>for many employees taxes will consume around 45 of their sudden wealth facebook said in its latest regulatory filing</s>

<p>
<s>tech companies even those not yet public traditionally reward their employees with stock grants or options that vest over time</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>but facebook pioneered a new form of employee equity using restricted stock units rsus that dont turn into actual stock until theres a liquidity event  in this case the companys ipo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebooks goal was to stay below a legal limit on how many shareholders a company can have before its required to publicly report its financial results</s>
<s>the tactic worked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the sec gave its blessing to facebooks approach which was then copied by two other buzzy startups zynga znga and twitter</s>
<s>the maneuver helped facebook postpone its ipo date until now</s>
<s>twitter has yet to file for an ipo</s>
<s>zynga went public in december</s>

<p>
<s>but the new stock units have created an unusual side effect thousands of current and former facebook employees will have their shares vest in a tight window about five to six months after facebooks ipo</s>
<s>in that onemonth span facebook plans to issue around 277 million shares to settle its rsu obligations</s>
</p>

<s>heres the kicker the irs taxes rsus as ordinary income on their full market value when they vest</s>
<s>the logic is hey the companys giving you valuable stock</s>
<s>thats part of your regular compensation and you should pay taxes on it when you get the shares not when you sell them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that means that facebook employees will owe federal and state taxes this year on their full windfall even if they choose to hang on to most of their shares</s>

<p>
<s>with stock options theres a lot of planning you can do around taxes  exercise some hold some spread out the timing says ray thornson a san franciscobased managing director of tax firm wtas</s>

<s>like most companies that issue rsus facebook is handling the tax logistics for its employees</s>
<s>it plans to withhold a big chunk of its employees shares  122 million  and sell them on the open market to cover the tax hit</s>
</p>

<s>so if a facebook employee is set to receive 10000 shares and falls into the 45 tax bracket including both state and federal charges the employee will actually receive 5500 shares and facebook will sell off the other 4500</s>
