<s>the flight out of us stocks continued last week with investors yanking $36 billion of domestic stock mutual funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors continued to bail out of us stock mutual funds last week despite a rally in the market fueled by an upbeat july jobs report and hopes that central bankers will soon step in to support financial markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors pulled $36 billion out of us stock mutual funds during the week ended aug 8 according to investment company institute</s>
<s>while the pace of outflows slowed considerably from the prior week when investors yanked nearly $57 billion out of stock funds it still marks the 25th week out of the last 27 that us stock mutual funds have bled money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact since the beginning of the year investors have pulled almost $67 billion from us stock mutual funds</s>
<s>by comparison these funds lost in the neighborhood of $40 billion during the first seven  months of 2010 and 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so where is all the money going</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bond funds remain hot according to shelly antoniewicz senior economist at ici</s>
<s>in total bond mutual funds drew in $72 billion during the latest week</s>
<s>so far this year bond funds have attracted more than $184 billion</s>
<s>in comparison bond funds pulled in less than $80 billion during the first seven months of 2011</s>

<p>
<s>fear  greed index back in extreme greed territory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hybrid funds which invest in both stocks and bonds have also been popular among investors adding $800 million in the latest week and $33 billion so far in 2012</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>weve been seeing this pattern for quite a while and there are demographic and secular factors in play said antoniewicz</s>
<s>she noted that as baby boomers get older and hit retirement age they are shifting money from stocks to bonds since they become more interested in preserving their capital instead of increasing it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover theres a general decline in the willingness of investors to take risks across all age groups</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we interpret that to mean that theyre less willing to hold equities said antoniewicz</s>
<s>that doesnt mean theyre completely fleeing equity markets but they are diversifying more and paring back exposure to stocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but as investors flee stock mutual funds theyre also embracing exchangetraded funds or etfs which allow investors to buy exposure to an index commodity or a basket of assets</s>
<s>etfs trade on an exchange just like stocks and are also often cheaper and more tax friendly than traditional mutual funds</s>
<s>while the etfs are only a tenth of the size of the mutual fund industry etfs have exploded in recent years and continue to grow at a rapid pace</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related 6 bestperforming etfs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in july etf assets grew by $162 billion</s>
<s>so far this year etfs have lured in more than $88 billion according to state street global advisors which is one of the largest managers of etfs</s>
<s>fixed income etfs have pulled in nearly $34 billion while largecap stock etfs like those that track the sp 500 have pulled in $11 billion</s>
