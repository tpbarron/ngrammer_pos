<s>google is playing a risky game of monopoly as it leverages its search industry dominance to jumpstart its products in other fields like social networking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  theres nothing illegal about being so big that you dominate a market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but when google goog fortune 500 unveiled a new feature last week called search plus your world some antitrust experts believe google stepped over the line</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>googles new feature risks abusing the companys dominant position in the search market to stifle competition from its rivals</s>
<s>that could be against the law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google runs a very high risk of being found in violation of antitrust and competition laws said ted henneberry a partner at orrick herrington  sutcliffes antitrust group</s>
<s>the issue raised by googles new announcement is how it potentially increases its dominance and furthers its discriminatory treatment of rivals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>search plus your world tailors search results to each individual user by tapping into googles social network google</s>
<s>search results now include google posts and profiles</s>
<s>noticeably absent from the feature are the much larger social networks of facebook and twitter or any other social service</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google insists that its users benefit from search plus your world and that the company has no legal duty to boost its rivals services</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the laws are designed to help consumers benefit from innovation not to help competitors said adam kovacevich a spokesman for google</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>generally thats true</s>
<s>antitrust law does not stipulate that companies need to bend over backwards to help rivals</s>
<s>even a monopoly has the right to develop new features and functions and the practice of bundling products together is not in itself illegal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but legal experts say dominant companies like google are in fact required to go out of their way to ensure fairness to competitors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a rule a company can favor its own products over someone elses but there are limits to that general rule when a company is a monopolist said sam miller a partner at sidley austin and the former lead prosecutor for the united states in one of its first antitrust cases against microsoft</s>
<s>sidley ironically counts microsoft msft fortune 500 as a client though miller is not currently involved with any cases for the software giant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is google a monopoly</s>
<s>with control of twothirds of the us search market according to comscore scor experts say it is legally within the realm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>market share is short hand for whether a company has monopoly power and 65 or more is a good indicator miller said</s>
<s>that level gives a company the ability to keep prices above competitive levels</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at a senate antitrust committee hearing in september google chairman eric schmidt acknowledged that googles market share is within that area of being monopolistic though he said hed prefer to let the judges  actually do such a finding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if google were to be considered a dominant firm cutting facebook and twitter out from its new search service could be seen as an anticompetitive  and illegal  act</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google claims that there are technical limitations that curb its ability to include competitors content in search plus your world</s>
<s>the company says facebook and twitter for instance do not let google crawl their sites for information</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google once partnered with twitter and featured tweets in its realtime search results</s>
<s>that alliance ended in july when googles contract with twitter expired</s>
<s>meanwhile facebook is searchable exclusively on microsofts bing engine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>googles kovacevich said google is looking to include additional types of content in search plus your world in the future</s>
<s> antitrust experts say thats besides the point</s>
<s>by bundling search with google google is in effect requiring companies to join google in order to get placed highest in its search results</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebook and twitter are shut out of that process</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>locking out competition is among the potential violations that the federal trade commission is currently investigating in its ongoing probe of google</s>
<s>the company first made the antitrust probe public in june</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>antitrust authorities grow concerned when a companys success is achieved or maintained by cutting out rivals said jeff schmidt a partner in law firm linklaters competition and antitrust practice</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>schmidt was formerly the director of the ftcs bureau of competition</s>
<s>until he left in 2008 he led the regulators oversight of google</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when issues of competition arise google frequently counters that there is plenty of competition on the internet</s>
<s>as the company often states rivals are just one click away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we believe that our improvements to search will benefit consumers by better surfacing social content said googles kovacevich</s>
<s>the great thing about the openness of the internet is that if users dont like our service they can easily switch to another site</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but some legal experts say its not quite that simple</s>
<s>microsofts decadelong bogglingly complex series of antitrust battles left reams of tech industry case law in their wake</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>antitrust theories launched in the microsoft litigation are destined to give google trouble at least in the short run said keith hylton antitrust professor at boston universitys school of law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google could also have a hard time proving that its new service is beneficial</s>
<s>reaction so far has been tepid at best</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if its in the consumers best interest its not damaging to competition said eric goldman director of the high tech law institute at santa clara law school</s>
<s>but by adding all that stuff to its search page thats not necessarily helpful</s>
<s>if we lose faith in googles motivation we begin to question why theyve done what they did</s>
