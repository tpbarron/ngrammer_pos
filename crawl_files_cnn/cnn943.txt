</p>

<p>
<s>the hard sell you may get at funeral homes can happen when youre arranging the burial too</s>
<s>theres a crucial difference at the cemetery there are no federal statutes like the funeral rule to protect you and few states have regulations about sales practices either</s>
<s>only six states require price lists for example says the funeral ethics organization</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet equally big bucks are at stake</s>
<s>a single plot runs about $1500 to $6000 depending on where you live according to ibisworld and youll pay from $600 to $2000 or more for cemetery workers to dig and recover the grave youll pay more if the burial is on a weekend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then theres the grave marker which could mean $250 for a basic headstone or thousands for an elaborate bronzed personalized monument</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to boost sales cemeteries are also expanding offerings for cremation customers  only 15 buy merchandise and when they do they spend $700 on average vs $1600 by families opting for a traditional burial according to janney capital markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the more common products a niche which is a recess in a wall where families can store an urn with cremated remains and a bench $3000 at one fort lauderdale cemetery or a bench estate for multiple family members $15000 in a scattering garden where relatives can spread the deceaseds ashes and later visit</s>

<p>
<s>although no state or federal agency tracks cemetery complaints carolyn jacobi of eternal justice a cemetery consumer advocate says she gets as many as 40 calls a day from families detailing problems similar to those heard about funeral homes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a typical one says jacobi operators telling families they have to buy a grave marker from the cemetery not an outside vendor</s>
<s>or a cemetery says the law requires a burial vault average price $1195 to prevent the earth from sinking as the casket deteriorates</s>
<s>its the cemetery not regulators that requires the container which makes the grounds easier to maintain a $400 concrete box called a grave liner is as effective jacobi says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related death be not a ripoff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since cemeteries unlike funeral homes are not required to give you a price list you also cant tell if youre being charged fairly jacobi says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a sales manager at memory gardens memorial park in medford ore lost his license last year after a judge found he had charged an elderly couple $495 each to dig and then fill in urn garden plots</s>
<s> the price on the cemeterys internal list $95</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the manager also slipped in a nonexistent $75 processing fee according to oregon cemeteryboard records violating laws on misrepresentations</s>
<s>the managers lawyer dean alterman says the mispricing was an honest mistake and the state overreacted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consumer advocates say cases like this underscore the need for oversight</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>the international cemetery cremation and funeral association iccfa says examples of wrongdoing are real but not pervasive enough to justify more regulation</s>
<s>it would be legislation by anecdote says executive director robert fells adding the group does encourage members to disclose prices and offers training to improve sales practices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the one aspect of cemeteries that states do regulate ensuring that the money consumers pay for ongoing maintenance called perpetual care is invested properly</s>
<s>most states require that a percentage of revenue from plots be set aside in a trust  10 in virginia and 15 in michigan for example  that pays for upkeep of the grounds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but some cemeteries may collect the money and not do the job according to state regulators in texas for example poor care and maintenance are the most common consumer complaints says deputy banking commissioner stephanie newberg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fells acknowledges that inadequate funding sometimes hinders proper upkeep by law he notes cemeteries can tap only the income from the trust not the principal and low interest rates have eaten into returns</s>
<s>this particularly affects independent cemeteries which make up 64 of the industry the remainder are three large chains and cant spread costs among multiple facilities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what you should do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>follow your own cemetery rule</s>
<s>although not required to do so by law the cemetery should give you a price list on request says fells</s>
<s>also ask for its rules in writing carlson says</s>
<s>when cemeteries hedge carlson explains its a red flag that theyre making things up as they go along</s>
</p>
