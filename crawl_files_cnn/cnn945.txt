<s>sopas backers say the sweeping antipiracy bill is needed to squash sites like the pirate bay left but the tech industry says the bill is rife with unintended consequences</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the tech industry is abuzz about sopa and pipa a pair of antipiracy bills</s>
<s>heres why theyre controversial and how they would change the digital landscape if they became law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what is sopa</s>
<s>sopa is an acronym for the stop online piracy act</s>
<s>its a proposed bill that aims to crack down on copyright infringement by restricting access to sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sopas main targets are rogue overseas sites like torrent hub the pirate bay which are a trove for illegal downloads</s>
<s>go to the the pirate bay type in any current hit movie or tv show like glee and youll see links to download full seasons and recent episodes for free</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>content creators have battled against piracy for years  remember napster</s>
<s> but its hard for us companies to take action against foreign sites</s>
<s>the pirate bays servers are physically located in sweden</s>
<s>so sopas goal is to cut off pirate sites oxygen by requiring us search engines advertising networks and other providers to withhold their services</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that means sites like google wouldnt show flagged sites in their search results and payment processors like ebays ebay fortune 500 paypal couldnt transmit funds to them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both sides say they agree that protecting content is a worthy goal</s>
<s>but opponents say that the way sopa is written effectively promotes censorship and is rife with the potential for unintended consequences</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>silicon valley woke up and took notice of the implications when sopa was introduced in the house of representatives in october</s>
<s>but its very similar counterpart pipa the protect ip act flew under the radar and was approved by a senate committee in may</s>
<s>pipa had been scheduled for a vote on january 24</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but after a massive pushback from tech companies and their supporters both sopa and pipa were officially postponed on january 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>isnt copyright infringement already illegal</s>
<s>yes</s>
<s>the 1998 digital millennium copyright act lays out enforcement measures</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets say a youtube user uploads a copyrighted song</s>
<s>under the current law that songs copyright holders could send a takedown notice to youtube</s>
<s>youtube is protected against liability as long as it removes the content within a reasonable timeframe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when it gets a dmca warning youtube has to notify the user who uploaded the content</s>
<s>that user has the right to file a countermotion demonstrating that the content doesnt infringe on any copyrights</s>
<s>if the two sides keep disagreeing the issue can go to court</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem with dmca critics say is that its useless against overseas sites</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sopa tackles that by moving up the chain</s>
<s>if you cant force overseas sites to take down copyrighted work you can at least stop us companies from providing their services to those sites</s>
<s>you can also make it harder for us internet users to find and access the sites</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but sopa goes further than dmca and potentially puts site operators  even those based in the us  on the hook for content that their users upload</s>
<s>the proposed bills text says that a site could be deemed a sopa scofflaw if it facilitates copyright infringement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that very broad language has tech companies spooked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sites like youtube which publishes millions of useruploaded videos each week are worried that they would be forced to more closely police that content to avoid running afoul of the new rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>youtube would just go dark immediately google public policy director bob boorstin said at a conference last month</s>
<s>it couldnt function</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tech companies also object to sopas shoot first ask questions later approach</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bill requires every payment or advertising network operator to set up a process through which outside parties can notify the company that one of its customers is an internet site is dedicated to theft of us</s>
<s>property</s>
<s> once a network gets a notification it is required to cut off services to the target site within five days</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>filing false notifications is a crime but the process would put the burden of proof  and the legal cost of fighting a false allegation  on the accused</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the antisopa trade group netcoalition put it in their analysis of the bill the legislation systematically favors a copyright owners intellectual property rights and strips the owners of accused websites of their rights</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>who supports sopa and whos against it</s>
<s>the controversial pair of bills sopa and pipa have sparked an allout war between hollywood and silicon valley</s>
<s>in general media companies have united in favor of them while techs big names are throwing their might into opposing them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sopas supporters  which include cnnmoney parent company time warner twx fortune 500 plus groups such as the motion picture association of america  say that online piracy leads to us job losses because it deprives content creators of income</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bills supporters dismiss accusations of censorship saying that the legislation is meant to revamp a broken system that doesnt adequately prevent criminal behavior</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but sopas critics say the bills backers dont understand the internets architecture and therefore dont appreciate the implications of the legislation theyre considering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in november tech behemoths including google goog fortune 500 and facebook lodged a formal complaint letter to lawmakers saying we support the bills stated goals</s>
<s>unfortunately the bills as drafted would expose lawabiding us internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities and mandates that would require monitoring of web sites</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>where does the bill stand now</s>
<s>sopa was once expected to sail quickly through committee approval in the house</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but tech companies who largely oppose the bills mobilized their users to speak out</s>
<s>wikipedia and reddit launched site blackouts on january 18 while protesters hit the streets in new york san francisco seattle and washington dc google goog fortune 500 drew more than 7 million signatures for a petition that it linked on its highly trafficked homepage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bills lost some of their congressional backers as a result of the backlash</s>
<s>both sopa and pipa were tabled on january 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the bills do come back up for discussion they will likely be extensively reworked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one major tenet of the original sopa legislation has already been removed</s>
<s>as originally written sopa would have required internet service providers isps to block access to sites that law enforcement officials deemed pirate sites</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the white house said its analysis of the original legislations technical provisions suggests that they pose a real risk to cybersecurity and that it wouldnt support legislation that mandates manipulating the internets technical architecture</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the white houses statement came shortly after one of sopas lead sponsors texas republican lamar smith agreed to remove sopas domainblocking provisions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what are the alternatives</s>
<s>one option of course is that congress does nothing and leaves the current laws in place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>alternative legislation has also been proposed</s>
<s>a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the online protection and enforcement of digital trade act open on january 18  the same day as the wikipedia site blackout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among other differences open offers more protection than sopa would to sites accused of hosting pirated content</s>
<s>it also beefs up the enforcement process</s>
<s>it would allow digital rights holders to bring cases before the us international trade commission itc an independent agency that handles trademark infringement and other trade disputes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>california republican darrell issa introduced open in the house and oregon democrat ron wyden introduced the senate version</s>
<s>opens backers had posted the draft legislation online and invited the web community to comment on and revise the proposal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sopa supporters counter that the itc doesnt have the resources for digital enforcement and that giving it those resources would be too expensive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>smith one of sopas lead sponsors released a scathing statement about open immediately after it was introduced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the open act does not do enough to combat online piracy and may make the problem worse smith wrote</s>
