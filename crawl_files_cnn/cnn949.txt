<s>funeral homes know your rights</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its the funeral rules most basic requirement provide cost information over the phone and an itemized price list in person so that consumers can pick the specific goods and services they want and compare costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats important given the wide disparity in funeralhome prices even in the same area</s>
<s>an analysis of 10 major cities by everest a funeralplanning service found that the difference in cost for a traditional funeral between the least and most expensive establishments within five miles of each other averages 164</s>
<s>see chart on the first page</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet a surprising number of funeral homes still fail to follow the rules  27 of the 507 locations visited by the ftc in the past four years up from an average noncompliance rate of 13 over the four years prior</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in new york city one of the few cities or states with their own regs 30 of facilities visited earlier this year did not have readily accessible price lists</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and when a city investigator posing as the daughterinlaw of a terminally ill man phoned funeral homes for pricing 60 didnt provide it as required by new york city law</s>
<s>stunning says consumer affairs head mintz</s>
<s>the violators paid fines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the funeral rule also gives you the right to buy only the specific goods and services you want</s>
<s>many families complain though that funeral directors pressure them to buy a package says lisa carlson executive director of the funeral ethics organization a nonprofit advocacy group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>often these packages include a lot of stuff you dont need as a way to get you to pay more she says</s>
<s>extras such as grief counseling digital tributes and expensive floral displays can easily ratchet up the price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a common tactic in selling such bundles says ed markin author of an affordable funeral is to present three price points</s>
<s>most people dont want to be considered cheap or overly extravagant he says so funeral directors know the family will typically choose the middle option and price accordingly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related senior victims lose big money to financial abuses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and while federal law requires the price list to be presented to the customer carlson says its not uncommon for it to be included within a jumble of other package pricing in an effort to confuse the consumer with too much information</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>scott gilligan general counsel of the nfda says that more choice is not meant to confuse the customer and often packages are offered at a discount</s>
<s>its the same thing that mcdonalds does on its value menu he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a funeral home may also imply that state or local law requires a particular service such as embalming according to consumer advocates</s>
<s>the truth is most states almost never require embalming and if a body does need to be preserved refrigeration is just as effective says josh slocum executive director of the funeral consumers alliance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because embalming brings in nearly $700 on average and as much as $3000 however a funeral director might just forget to enlighten you about the facts says slocum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dan rohling a consumer advocate and former cemetery investigator from california says homes are under pressure to squeeze as much profit from every customer they can</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with 43 of funeral shoppers now choosing cremation over traditional burial vs just 26 in 2000 the profit per sale earned by independent funeral homes  the vast majority of the business  has fallen 27 in the past 10 years the federated funeral directors of america reports</s>
<s>exacerbating the crunch the industry has high fixed costs including for embalming rooms which are required by 37 states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related seniors beware the sales pitch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>financial pressures are also one reason the ftc has filed so few lawsuits against violators of the funeral rule  only six enforcement actions have been taken in the past 12 years</s>
<s>with limited resources to pursue costly litigation the agency instead mostly diverts offenders into a threeyear program that provides ongoing training and monitoring for compliance they also pay fines average $6000 per violator</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given the scope of the problem relative to identity theft and other consumer complaints we are absolutely doing enough says roberto anguizola assistant director of the ftcs marketingpractices division</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consumer advocate slocum says since the ftc doesnt release the names of offending funeral homes or details about the violations the agencys effectiveness is hard to judge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what you should do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>check prices at three homes minimum</s>
<s>four out of five consumers dont shop around when planning a funeral aarp reports</s>
<s>dont feel pressured to go with the first place you see or the one everyone you know used you can compare costs by phone or online in less than a day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ask about both the mandatory basicservices fee which covers the time and overhead of the funeral director and staff and itemized charges for the additional services you select</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>get help with the search</s>
<s>if collecting multiple quotes feels too daunting try efuneralcom or everests pricefinder tool good for pricing up to eight homes in your area $29 everestfuneralcom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you can also sometimes get discounted rates through your local branch of the funeral consumers alliance funeralsorg</s>
