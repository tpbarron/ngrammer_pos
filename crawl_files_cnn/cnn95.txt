<s>i am a cosigner of my daughters private college loans for a balance of $65000</s>
<s>i have been paying the minimum requirement each month but i have come to realize that she is unlikely to be able to pick up these payments on her own so i will be paying these loans at an accelerated rate</s>
<s>should i consider my payments a gift</s>
<s>will this affect the student loan interest deduction on my federal return</s>

<p>
<s>as cosigner of the loan the debt is a joint liability and therefore it is your obligation along with your daughters to pay it off</s>
<s>because it is your debt it cannot be considered a gift says janet hagy of hagy  associates an accounting firm in austin tex</s>

<p>
<s>that said you can claim any interest that you pay on a qualified loan on your tax return up to $2500</s>
<s>the irs provides information on student loan interest deduction in chapter four of its publication 970 found at irsgov</s>
