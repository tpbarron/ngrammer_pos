<s>problems with prepayments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>prepaid arrangements promise to save your family money and stress by allowing you to plan a funeral and lock in prices years early</s>
<s>you choose the arrangements and pay the bill upfront</s>
<s>the money goes into a trust account or an insurance policy until the services are needed</s>
<s>good deal eh</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not so much</s>
<s>with charges ranging from difficulty getting refunds to mismanagement of funds prepaid contracts are high on the list of complaints about the deathcare industry the money survey of states found</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>yet prepaid sales are up sharply</s>
<s>at service corp international sci the largest funeral chain prepaid contracts rose 28 to $11 billion over the five years ending in 2011 according to the companys financial statements</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that success is due at least in part to clever marketing that combines standard sales pressure with emotional tugs</s>
</p>

<s>and if you signed up by months end youd get a 20 discount  on what was unclear since no price lists were handed out</s>
<s>asked about the appropriateness of those sales tactics an sci spokesman simply said the product was a good deal for consumers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>signing up often seems like a lowrisk proposition since providers usually promise you can transfer your contract to another facility</s>
<s>however seven states dont guarantee the right to transfer your contract and two more allow it only if you relocate  you cant just change your mind according to a 2011 nfda report</s>
<s>depending on the state you may also have to pay fees to make the switch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>laws also differ about how much if any refund youre entitled to</s>
<s>if your contract allows you to cancel you may pay a fee ranging from interest earned on the account to 25 of its value</s>
<s>loopholes in the terms may further reduce your refund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>states require funeral homes and cemeteries to set aside a percentage of the money customers prepay</s>
<s>but some allow providers to keep funds paid for merchandise if they can show theyve delivered it  sending an urn to your home or storing a casket for you in a warehouse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>advocates say some places inflate the value of the merchandise to avoid setting aside or refunding your money</s>

<p>
<s>the department of insurance is still investigating to see whether the practice continues says spokeswoman marianne goodland</s>
<s>neptune says that it follows all rules on trusts and refunds and the situation in colorado was an isolated incident</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its also possible to shell out thousands more on a prepaid contract than the funeral costs</s>
<s>that can happen when you buy an insurance policy and pay over time instead of in a lump sum as jo swigers family discovered</s>
</p>

<s>cost $15688 in premiums</s>

<s>after her mom died in 2011 daughter ann bauer learned that the policy which had a savings account that grew over time would pay out only $10807</s>
<s>i dont understand how they can call that an insurance policy says bauer an account manager at a san diego radio station</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lincoln vice president shirley grossman says most of its customers are younger and have time for benefits to grow and adds that lincoln no longer sells multiplepayment policies to customers over 85</s>
<s>but anyone who pays over time can expect to pay 40 more than the arrangements price says william stalter a kansas lawyer who helps funeral homes create prepayment plans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally regulators report frequent and rising instances of mismanagement and fraud with prepaid contracts a december report from the government accountability office found</s>

<s>what you should do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just say no</s>
<s>you dont need to buy a special product to set aside money for final arrangements</s>
<s>you may have enough life insurance to cover the bills</s>
