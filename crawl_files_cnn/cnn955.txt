<s>new york cnnmoney  if youre considering an upgrade to windows 8 this fall microsoft just made the option much cheaper</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the software giant announced monday that anyone running windows xp or a more recent version can upgrade to windows 8 pro for just $40</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats significantly less than what microsoft typically charges customers to update their operating systems</s>
<s>for instance the cheapest upgrade version of windows 7 for those running older editions of windows costs $120 on microsofts online store</s>
<s>even upgrading from one windows 7 version to another will set you back at least $65</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft msft fortune 500 said the $40 upgrade fee is a promotional rate that will last through the end of january 2013 and it will require that users download windows 8 over the internet</s>
<s>a dvd version will be available in stores for $70 throughout the promotion</s>
</p>

<s>apple aapl fortune 500 has charged just $29 to upgrade to the last two versions of mac os x and when the newest update called mountain lion goes on sale later this month the company will charge just $20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nearly 85 of macs are running the latest mac os 107 lion or the previous version mac os 106 snow leopard according to net applications</s>

<p>
<s>that rapid adoption hasnt been matched by microsoft customers</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>upgrading an aging pc to a brandnew version of windows is usually a bad idea  windows can be a notorious resource hog  but windows 8 could be the exception</s>

<p>
<s>but microsofts primary concern is getting a critical mass of users so that its new app store will thrive</s>
</p>

<s>microsoft has most of the key apps covered but its offerings are nowhere close to the hundreds of thousands of apps that apple and google have for their smartphones and tablets</s>
</p>

<s>the company is running a separate promotion on its website under which customers who buy a windows 7 pc between june 2 2012 and jan 31 2013 can get a windows 8 pro upgrade for $15</s>
</p>

<p>
