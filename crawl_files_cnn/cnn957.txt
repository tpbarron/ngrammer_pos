<s>new york cnnmoney  the pc needs saving</s>
<s>with windows 8 microsoft believes it has the magic cure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it just might</s>
<s>ive been testing a consumer preview version of windows 8 for the past week and its unlike anything ive ever seen in a pc operating system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the stunning metro interface just begs you to touch and interact with it</s>
<s>beautifully designed apps ultrasimple navigation and instinctive commands make it hard to believe metro came from the same company that brought us windows vista</s>
<s>interactive live tiles and an intuitive app store simplify the pc</s>
<s>windows 8 is as easy to use as the ipad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats exactly what microsoft intended</s>
<s>as pc sales slump amid a surge in tablets okay ipads microsoft msft fortune 500 is creating an operating system that lets hardware makers reimagine the pc for a tablet world</s>
<s>the software is slated to go on sale later this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but lets be clear under the veneer of its redesign windows 8 is still very much a pc operating system</s>
<s>it features the familiar desktop and taskbar youve learned to love  or hate  over the years and it works just as well with a keyboard and mouse as it does with a touchscreen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats the key difference between apples aapl fortune 500 ipad strategy and microsofts windows 8 approach</s>
<s>apple made a complementary gadget while microsofts software is designed for a catchall device</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ipad is the simplest entry point to what apple calls the postpc world but pcs havent outlived their usefulness just yet</s>
<s>most people still go to their pcs for tools like microsoft office and more complex content creation tasks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thats where microsoft sees uncharted territory</s>
<s>it wants windows 8 to power each users primary device which can be as portable and intuitive as the ipad but also be able to perform all the intricate tasks that todays tablet users flock to their pcs for</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft does that by making the desktop itself into an app</s>
<s>the pc boots to the metro interface which serves as the start screen and main backdrop for windows 8</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>metro is ideal for everyday tasks like web browsing email photo sharing social networking and casual gaming</s>
<s>but when you need to manage files edit a document or do anything else you wouldnt typically try on an ipad a tap or click on the desktop app launches what looks and feels like the windows 7 interface</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is windows 8 a perfect solution</s>
<s>not quite but its getting closer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what i liked windows 8 meets microsofts goal of producing a fast and fluid operating system</s>
<s>its so lightweight in fact that even on a fiveyearold battered dell laptop with a puny intel intc fortune 500 centrino processor windows 8 booted up in 16 seconds</s>
<s>by contrast my iphone 4s takes 27 seconds to start up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the app store is well designed and the metro apps are of the same quality youd expect from the ipad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there were some bugs as youd anticipate from a preview version of the software but getting out of a stalled program has never been easier</s>
<s>just tap the windows key and youre back to the start screen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my favorite feature was the builtin search mechanism which allows you to just type to find and launch a program or file</s>
<s>adios ctrlr</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what i didnt like my main gripe is a design oddity the word start is permanently displayed in the upper left hand corner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it wouldnt be as irksome if start did anything but you cant click on it tap it swipe it or interact with in in any way</s>
<s>it just sits there staring at you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to actually launch the start menu options you have to swipe from the right of the screen or hit windows keyc thats the only way to bring up the clock wifi status or battery life</s>
<s>maybe those things could be displayed at the top of the screen instead of start</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if thats my biggest quibble so far microsoft might be onto something big</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line windows 8 wont kill the ipad</s>
<s>its not trying to</s>
<s>its trying to save the pc</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anyone 25 or older probably remembers the way windows 95 reimagined what a pc could do</s>
<s>windows 8 does that again to a much greater degree</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not hard to envision waking up to your alarm in the morning reading a book on the train creating spreadsheets at work playing angry birds on your ride home and watching netflix in bed  all on the same windows 8 deviceÂ </s>
