<s>new york money magazine  im 41 and feeling a bit burned out after 10 years at my current job so im thinking about taking a year or so off to travel</s>
<s>i have no dependents no debt to speak of and ive got about $750000 in savings</s>
<s>still i worry that if i leave my job i may not be able to find another later on</s>
<s>what do you think  am i insane for wanting to quit my job in the current economic environment</s>

<p>
<s>insane</s>
<s>not at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im sure there are plenty of people out there who would jump at the chance to get away from the workaday grind if they had anything close to the resources you do</s>
<s>indeed many people operating on far thinner margins still manage to take time off to rejuvenate themselves or explore new career possibilities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so if you really feel burned out  as opposed to being in a temporary funk  i dont see anything wrong with tapping into your financial cushion now as opposed to waiting another 25 years until you retire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course there is some risk involved</s>
<s>theres certainly no guarantee that youll be able to find a new job that gives you a salary and benefits comparable to what youre currently making </s>

<p>
<s>if the economy is still struggling when youre ready to reenter the workforce finding any job could take quite a while</s>
<s>between 2007 and 2011 the median length of time it took an unemployed person to find a new job nearly doubled from 52 weeks to 10 weeks according to a recent bureau of labor statistics report</s>
<s>these figures dont include the unemployed who unable to find work gave up</s>
<s>those discouraged job seekers spent a median of 214 weeks before throwing in the towel</s>

<p>
<s>as the economy improves however so should the ability of workers to move in and out of jobs</s>
<s>as long as you have skills that are valuable to an employer  and i assume you must if youve been able to earn enough to support yourself while socking away so much dough  i think your worry that you may not be able to find a job is overblown</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>taking some time away might even work in your favor</s>
<s>by giving you the opportunity to recharge a break may help you become a more motivated and productive worker and possibly enhance your future earning ability</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>research also shows that a hiatus may give you the chance to acquire professional and other skills you may not have had a chance to build otherwise</s>
<s>such benefits are probably why nearly a quarter of the firms on fortunes 2012 list of the top 100 companies to work for offer fully paid sabbaticals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if you have to settle for a job that doesnt pay as well your chances of ending up impoverished later in life dont strike me as very high given the amount of money youve already managed to set aside</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lets say that between living expenses taxes and just having a good time gallivanting around you withdraw $150000 from your nest egg during your year off</s>
<s>assuming you earn enough you dont ever have to dip into the remaining $600000 you should be able to live pretty well in retirement just on that sum plus investment returns alone</s>
<s>you wouldnt even have to save another cent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with just a modest 5 annual return for example $600000 would grow to roughly $19 million by the time youre 65 which is enough to generate about $75000 in inflationadjusted income throughout retirement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i think its far more likely that youll be able to find a decent job continue to save and build an even bigger retirement stash</s>
<s>but even if thats not the case its not as if youll have to go into survivalist mode to get by</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres one other reason you may want to go ahead with your wish to take a year off it may make you happier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i certainly dont want to discount the importance of working hard saving diligently and making sure we meet our financial obligations</s>
<s>but theres more to life than just making the most money you can or racking up the largest possible 401k balance</s>
<s>you also want to enjoy yourself and feel fulfilled</s>
<s>if leaving the workaday world for a while will help you achieve a better lifework balance i say go for it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before you do though youll probably want to do a little planning</s>
<s>estimate how much you think youll need to spend during your year off and figure out which accounts you can best tap for cash</s>
<s>as much as possible you should draw from savings accounts and the like rather than investment accounts to avoid paying taxes on investment gains</s>
<s>ideally you should also avoid tapping 401ks and iras since withdrawals may trigger penalties in addition to taxes</s>

<p>
<s>youll also want to make sure you have health insurance either by maintaining coverage from your employer via cobra or by buying a policy from a private insurer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>think too about how you actually want to spend this time off so you get the most out of it</s>
<s>you can find suggestions for different types of sabbaticals as well as personal stories from people whove taken one by going to yoursabbaticalcom</s>
<s>and rather than just walking off the job you may want to try negotiating a paid sabbatical or at least the option of returning to your company</s>
<s>if youre unsuccessful hey youre no worse off</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bottom line it seems to me that youre in a pretty unique position to be able to pull off something that many people can only dream about</s>
<s>but ultimately youll have to decide whether the gains from going ahead with your plan outweigh the risks</s>
