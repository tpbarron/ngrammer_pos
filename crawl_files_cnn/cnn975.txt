<s>new york cnnmoney  verizon has decided to block its customers from installing googles new highprofile wallet application on the carriers smartphones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>welcome to the opening shot in the war over who will get a piece of the action as your smartphone becomes your mobile wallet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a year ago verizon att t fortune 500 and tmobile teamed up with discover dfs fortune 500 and barclays bcs to form a mobile payments company called isis</s>
<s>using a technology called nearfield communications or nfc the forthcoming isis mobile wallet will let consumers store multiple credit cards and make payments with a wave of their phone</s>
<s>theyll also be able to check balances receive coupons and use rewards points at the point of sale</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google wallet is a nearly identical nfc service</s>
<s>unveiled by google in may the service requires two pieces an nfc chip and googles app</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first phone to feature native google wallet support is samsungs nexus s which went on sale last year with a builtin nfc chip</s>
<s>in september google wallet went live and the samsung nexus s became googles mobile payments guinea pig</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres the catch sprint s fortune 500 along with mastercard ma fortune 500 and citigroup c fortune 500 threw its support behind google wallet and partnered with google</s>
<s>verizon and the other major carriers are backing team isis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the two technologies can coexist happily</s>
<s>mastercard for example has partnered with both isis and google wallet</s>
<s>phones can easily support both options letting customers download either or both payment apps and choosing which they prefer to use</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but with billions at stake in the mobile payments revenue stream every player in the ecosystem is moving very very cautiously</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is an opening salvo in what is likely to be a very long war for the mobile consumer wallet said carl howe analyst at yankee group</s>
<s>i think this is perhaps a very good indication that google is now a very close frenemy of verizon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the samsung galaxy nexus set to go on sale later this month was supposed to be the first android device on the verizon network to feature google wallet</s>
<s>its the third of googles hero android smartphones which are designed by google explicitly to show off the cuttingedge features of its android operating system</s>
<s>google partners with manufacturers on the phones  samsung in this case  and releases them under the nexus brand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but a google goog fortune 500 spokesman said tuesday that verizon wireless has asked the search company not to include this functionality in the product</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>googles spokesman declined to discuss verizons reasoning or comment further</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>verizon vz fortune 500s spokesman jeffrey nelson countered that the company does not block apps</s>
<s> the problem verizon says lies in google wallets technology</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google wallet is different from other widelyavailable mobilecommerce services nelson said in a prepared statement</s>
<s>in order to work as architected by google google wallet needs to be integrated into a new secure and proprietary hardware element in our phones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its true that google wallet needs to access a special nfc chip built into the device</s>
<s>verizon didnt explain why that was a problem particularly because googles technology has been working just fine on sprints network for several months</s>
<s>but verizon said it is continuing commercial discussions with google about the issue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>were working to provide expanded services that will provide the best security and user experience in the market around mobile commerce nelson continued</s>
<s>we expect to provide access to an open wallet when those goals are achieved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its not a direct answer but its possible to read between the lines</s>
<s>since verizon said it is working to provide access to an open wallet and not specifically googles wallet app its likely that verizon is hoping to favor its own mobile payments option over googles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both isis and wallet are theoretically open services meaning any card company carrier manufacturer or even mobile operating system can participate</s>
<s>but so far each has mostly gone its separate ways</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>verizons blocking of google especially ironic because google and verizon fought together to lobby the federal communications commission to allow carriers to determine what services can be used on smartphones running on their networks</s>
<s>that agreement is coming back to haunt google</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last year as the industry thrashed out socalled net neutrality rule google and verizon stuck a controversial compromise they jointly agreed that open internet proposals should not apply to the mobile market</s>
<s>their position was that the wireless field is more competitive and changing more rapidly than the wireline broadband market and shouldnt be constrained by added regulation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fcc ended up drafting rules that closely mirrored those suggested by google and verizon</s>
<s>those rules went into effect nov 20</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>can verizon permanently keep googles wallet off its smartphones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>probably not</s>
<s>when the public pressure  and pointed queries from washington watchdogs  grows intense enough tech industry rivals tend to make their peace</s>
<s>apple aapl fortune 500 for example finally got over its claimed technical objections and let rival services like google voice onto its iphone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but verizon can drag its feet  and its latest chess move indicates that its not giving google a mobile payments headstart without a fight</s>
