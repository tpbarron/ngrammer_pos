<s>new york cnnmoney  the gi bill was designed to help veterans but the biggest beneficiaries seem to be the forprofit private schools that are raking in taxpayer dollars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the department of veterans affairs bankrolls four years of higher education for veterans who have served since september 11 2001</s>
<s>the va paid out $44 billion for tuition and fees in the two academic years spanning 2009 to 2011</s>
<s>forprofit private schools raked in 37 of those funds but educated just 25 of veterans according to the us senates health education labor and pensions help committee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so what are taxpayers getting in return</s>
<s>according to the va the graduation rate is just 28 at forprofit schools like university of phoenix and devry university for all students not just veterans</s>
<s>that compares with a graduation rate of 67 at nonprofit private schools and 57 at public schools</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the gi bill covers all tuition at public schools and up to $17000 per year at private schools</s>
<s>but tuition at many private schools far exceeds that so veterans take out loans to cover the balance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the average tuition at a forprofit school is steep  six times higher than a community college and double the cost of a fouryear public school according to sen tom harkin of iowa chairman of the help committee</s>
<s>and students at forprofit schools have a loandefault rate of 47 according to the senate committee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2010 after hearing complaints from constituents about problems with forprofit schools harkin conducted an undercover investigation</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>during that same twoyear span the va paid about $20 million to the university of california and another $15 million to the state university of new york</s>
<s>even less money went to esteemed  and hard to get into  nonprofit private schools like harvard which received $36 million from the gi bill and princeton university which received $173000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>troublesome allegations have been levied against forprofit privates</s>
<s>the white house accused some institutions of recruiting brain damaged veterans without providing academic support encouraging vets to take out costly loans from the schools themselves withholding information about graduation rates and engaging in misleading recruiting practices on military installations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in april the white house issued an executive order against these types of activities since the post911 gi bill became law there have been reports of aggressive and deceptive targeting of service members veterans and their families by some education institutions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>itt tech devry university kaplan and the art institutes didnt return calls for comment</s>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<s>some veterans have also complained about losing credits when they transfer from forprofit privates to other schools</s>
<s>gunderson blamed that problem on the schools that refuse to accept the credits</s>
</p>

<p>
