<s>a traditional ira is a taxdeferred retirement savings account</s>
<s>you pay taxes on your money only when you make withdrawals in retirement</s>
<s>deferring taxes means all of your dividends interest payments and capital gains can compound each year without being hindered by taxes  allowing an ira to grow much faster than a taxable account</s>

<s>traditional iras come in two varieties deductible and nondeductible</s>
<s>whether you qualify for a full or partial tax deduction depends mostly on your income and whether you have access to a workrelated retirement account like a 401k</s>
