<s>theres a lot in store for small business owners in president obamas health reform law</s>
<s>they should keep a close eye on the upcoming supreme court decision</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new york cnnmoney  the health reform law is chock full of new rules and benefits for small businesses  and all are now on the line at the supreme court</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 2010 affordable care act includes everything from a different way to shop for insurance to a tax credit that rewards employers for insuring workers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the supreme courts decision on the laws constitutionality is due out later this month even as soon as monday</s>
<s>generally speaking there are three main possible outcomes health care reform could be upheld entirely or struck down entirely or the court could do away with only some provisions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are so many facets to the law that even partial survival could yield some benefits to entrepreneurs such as the tax credit</s>
<s>thats why john arensmeyer who leads the proreform group small business majority said striking down the whole law would be a nightmare</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all the benefits will go away arensmeyer said</s>
<s>well be thrown right back into the unsustainable system weve had to date</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the justices elect to keep some parts while knocking down others the 906page law could become even more confusing than it is now</s>
<s>heres a list of key provisions  and what could happen to small businesses if theyre maintained or discarded</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fines starting in 2014 the law requires any company with at least 50 fulltime employees to provide insurance or pay fines</s>
<s>the size of the penalty depends on a formula in the law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if one or more workers turns to the government for help buying insurance the company will be assessed a penalty of at least $40000 depending on the size of its workforce</s>
<s>if this provision vanishes theres one less rule for small businesses to worry about</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the rule affects 200000 small businesses a tiny fraction of the nations approximately six million employers</s>
<s>more than 96 of small businesses fall below the 50employee threshold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>individual mandate this is perhaps the most controversial part of the law before the court</s>
<s>it forces every person to purchase some sort of health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mandate counter balances another provision one that forces insurers to take on people with preexisting conditions</s>
<s>the idea of the mandate is to force healthy people who otherwise might not get insurance to join the pool of the insured thus diluting the cost of health care</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the mandate disappears but the 50plus employee rule stays insurance costs could skyrocket for small businesses who will be forced to provide workers with insurance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>exchanges starting in 2014 companies with up to 100 workers will have the option to buy lower cost health insurance through employeronly exchanges set up by the states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre called small business health options programs and these exchanges are intended to bring down the cost of health care for small firms</s>
<s>they will make it possible for business owners to compare similar insurance plans  just as consumers shop for other services</s>
<s>they also could help small firms by allowing them to effectively add their employees to a much larger pool of insurance customers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal law ordered states to create them and a dozen have already started</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>striking down this provision wouldnt necessarily stop states from creating exchanges</s>
<s>but it would do away with federal grants helping them do so making the process more difficult for some impossible for others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax credits since 2010 some small businesses have received tax credits rewarding them for providing workers with health insurance</s>
<s>eligible companies must have no more than 25 workers and pay average salaries of $50000 or less</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>losing the tax credits would mean no more help from the federal government which averaged $2700 last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but it has turned out to be an underwhelming tax credit</s>
<s>employers say applying for the credit involves a lengthy complicated formula that sometimes yields very little financial help</s>
<s>only 170300 companies received it last year for tax year 2010 even though the government estimates between 14 million and 4 million are eligible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 80 rule for insurers since 2011 insurance companies have been required to spend at least 80 of every dollar on medical care and not administrative costs  or refund the difference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this rule known as the medical loss ratio is especially important for small businesses</s>
<s>administrative costs typically have taken up a much larger chunk of small companies insurance costs when compared to large companies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the rule has already been shown to work at least in california where 4400 companies received $35 million in refunds from insurance company unitedhealth this month</s>
<s>unitedhealth was forced to return the money to comply with the 80 rule</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>eliminating the ratio would drive up insurance costs for many small companies</s>
