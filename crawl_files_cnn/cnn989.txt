<s>france and germany may be the standouts when it comes to economic growth in europe</s>
<s>but thats not saying much</s>

<s>investors seemed relieved by the latest gdp figures out of europe tuesday</s>
<s>but why</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sure i guess the numbers could have been a lot worse</s>
<s>but the eurozones overall economy shrunk by 02 from the first quarter to the second quarter</s>
<s>and germanys economy rose by only 03 compared to the first quarter</s>
<s>keep in mind that germany is supposed to be the star of europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if europe were a baseball team germany might have a batting average of  only 255  and that only looks good because france which reported no change in gdp is batting 240 while greece spain italy and portugal are struggling to stay above 200</s>
<s>being the best of a sorry lot doesnt necessarily mean you are good</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>making matters worse its hard to imagine how much longer germany can continue to prop up the rest of europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists for brokerage firm brockhouse cooper in montreal noted in a report tuesday morning that it is no secret that germany is heavily tradedependent</s>
<s> the economists expressed concerns that germany wont be able to boost domestic demand enough to buffer against the storm circles in the rest of europe and warned that germany should prepare for a rocky road ahead as the countrys trade partners remain in rough shape</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the germans themselves seem increasingly nervous about the rest of europe as well</s>
<s>a report issued tuesday by the the centre for european economic research in mannheim indicated that economic sentiment in germany was at its lowest level of the year a sign that germans expect their economy to slow further over the second half of the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if germany cant support the eurozone who can</s>
<s>france</s>
<s>thats unlikely</s>
<s>so investors should not get fooled into thinking that the debt crisis is over just because longterm bond yields in spain and italy have retreated from the peak crisis levels</s>
<s>more importantly european central bank chief mario draghi should not get lulled into a sense of false security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while draghi obviously would prefer for sovereign nations to fix their own fiscal problems its increasingly clear that some european leaders lack the political will or economic knowhow to effectively do so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>related ecb ties bond market aid to government cuts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>draghi still needs to leave all options on the table including more aggressive purchases of debt from the most troubled southern european nations</s>
<s>it would also behoove draghi to continue putting pressure on germany to reconsider its position regarding the issuance of common european debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>germany has been reluctant to consider socalled eurobonds because those bonds would likely fetch much higher interest rates than germanys ultralow yield of about 15 on its 10year bund</s>
<s>but thats shortsighted</s>
<s>the biggest folly of the eurozone is that the various members share a currency but not debt</s>
<s>this would be akin to the united states having no federal treasury bonds and instead merely having 50 different bonds and notes for each of the states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats more germany also clearly benefits from the fact that its neighbors are in such sorry shape</s>
<s>if there was no euro and we went back to a world of drachmas lire pesetas escudos and francs the deutsche mark would undoubtedly be much stronger than nearly all the other individual european currencies</s>
<s>and that would hurt germanys exporting power around the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>germany may not like subsidizing the rest of europe</s>
<s>but the alternative may be scarier</s>
<s>so hopefully draghi can show just how super he is by convincing angela merkel to work even more closely with frances francois hollande and other key european leaders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>remember that the european crisis has been going on since the beginning of 2010</s>
<s>weve all been waiting for an epic collapse of a nation or big financial institution to shake europe to its core like the united states was in 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet that may never happen</s>
<s>instead of greece spain or italy subbing for lehman fannie mae and aig we may continue to get a slow bleed unless europe finally decides that the only way out of the economic malaise is through actual unified action</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>until theres strong evidence of true cooperation investors would be silly to buy into any hype about a european recovery</s>
<s>but as the chart below shows investors in french and german stocks clearly are holding their nose and hoping for the best</s>
