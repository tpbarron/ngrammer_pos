<s>the postal service could run out of cash in october</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>washington cnnmoney  without help from congress the postal service will not only default on payments for retiree health care benefits but it could lack cash for operations by midoctober</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as of midnight wednesday the postal service was in default  for the first time in its history  on a $55 billion payment owed the federal government to prepay health care benefits for retirees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while the postal service is in big financial trouble due to fewer people sending mail and the mandate to prepay retiree benefits the default is largely symbolic</s>
<s>the agency will skip that payment and another $56 billion payment due sept 30 while continuing to pay employees and contractors to deliver the mail on time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however by oct 15 the agencys cash crunch could result in a $100 million shortfall according to david c williams the services inspector general</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we concur with the postal services projections that it might not have sufficient cash to fund its operations in october 2012 and at other times during fiscal year 2013 williams wrote in a july 25 memo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the timing is significant because experts dont expect congress to make much headway on saving the postal service until after the november election</s>
<s>while the senate passed a bill in april the house has yet to take up its version</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the postal service runs out of money in october it may be brief according to the service and the inspector generals office</s>
<s>the service is expecting an uptick in mail volume and revenue thanks to the 2012 presidential election and the holiday season to help make ends meet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if election and holiday mail dont come through financial shortfalls could be worse the inspector general warns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the postal service has a backup plan to conserve cash so itll be able to deliver mail on time and keep the lights on at post offices</s>
<s>it would skip paying into the federal retirement system and would skimp on workers compensation payments due to the department of labor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stiffing the retirement system wouldnt be so bad since the postal service has overpaid that program to the tune of $114 billion</s>
<s>both bills in congress would allow the service to recoup that money in order to pay off other debts including a $127 billion loan from treasury</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but shortchanging the workers compensation payments could have consequences the inspector general warned</s>
<s>the department of labor may not have enough in reserve for its program which compensates federal employees who have been injured on the job</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>postal service chief financial officer stephen j</s>
<s>masse said officials hadnt made a decision about whether to take any extraordinary cash preservation measures and would monitor the cash situation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>postal watchers expect the house to take up a bill authored by rep darrell issa a california republican after nov 6</s>
<s>if the bill passes then the two chambers would meet to resolve differences between the bills</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theyre not going to be doing anything other than posturing before the election said anthony conway executive director of the alliance of nonprofit mailers</s>
<s>while i think issa has the votes its a tough vote to take right before the election</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>conway says he expects congress will eventually step up and rescue the postal service before the agency is forced to contemplate the kind of insolvency that would prevent workers from being paidÂ </s>
