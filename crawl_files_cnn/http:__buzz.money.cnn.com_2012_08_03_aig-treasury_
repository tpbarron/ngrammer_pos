<p>American International Group (AIG) said it will buy back up to $3 billion of its stock from the U.S. Treasury Friday as part of the government's offering of $4.5 billion of the insurer's shares on the open market.</p>

<p>The stock sale will move the U.S. government closer to a point where it would own just half of the insurer's shares outstanding. The Treasury Department currently holds a 61% stake in the company. AIG said that Citigroup (C), Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the banks working on the stock offering.</p>

<p>Shortly after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2008, AIG was also teetering on the edge. The U.S. government offered AIG an $85 billion lifeline that eventually ballooned to $182 billion.</p>

<p>AIG's stock was halted mid-day Friday following the Treasury news, but shares moved higher once they resumed trading. The stock finished the day up 1.6%. It has been a good year so far for AIG. Shares have gained 35% in 2012. On Thursday, AIG reported a second-quarter profit of $2.33 billion, ahead of analysts' expectations.</p>

<p>The rebound for AIG has been good for the government and taxpayers as well. The stock closed Friday at $31.34. That's nearly 10% higher than the Treasury Department's break-even price of $28.72 a share for its investment.</p>
