<p>HSBC reported Monday that it turned a profit of $5 billion in the third quarter, a figure held down by the scandal-plagued bank's efforts to absorb a series of fines and penalties.</p>

<p>The London-based firm set aside $800 million to pay fines that may result from the bank's alleged links to drug cartels and terrorist groups. In the second quarter, the bank set aside an initial $700 million for the same purpose.</p>

<p>In July, a U.S. congressional committee issued a report detailing a lack of oversight at HSBC which resulted in thousands of suspicious transactions with clients of dubious repute.</p>

<p>Among other issues, the report noted that in 2007 and 2008, HSBC's Mexico unit shipped $7 billion in cash to the bank's U.S. affiliate, a volume of shipments that law enforcement officials said could reach that size "only if they included illegal drug proceeds."</p>

<p>HSBC Mexico had a number of high-profile clients linked to drug trafficking, the report said, as well as "a huge backlog of accounts marked for closure due to suspicious activity, but whose closures were delayed."</p>

<p>The report also found that HSBC worked extensively with Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Bank, some owners of which have been linked to terrorism financing, according to a CIA report quoted by the subcommittee. Some evidence suggests Al Rajhi's "key founder" was "an early financial benefactor of al Qaeda," the report said.</p>

<p>Even with $1.5 billion set aside to pay for its alleged indiscretions, more may be needed. In a statement released Monday, chief executive Stuart Gulliver said that U.S. authorities have "substantial discretion" on how to resolve the charges, and that no agreement has been reached.</p>

<p>"Indeed," Gulliver said, "the final amount of the financial penalties could be higher, possibly significantly higher, than the amount accrued." After the report's release, the bank issued a statement acknowledging it had "sometimes failed to meet the standards that regulators and customers expect."</p>

<p>HSBC also earmarked $353 million to compensate customers sold payment protection insurance, bringing the banks total hit for the quarter to $1.15 billion. The bank has been under fire for misleading clients regarding the purchase of certain kinds of insurance that prevented most policyholders from filing a claim.</p>

<p>In addition, the bank is being scrutinized for its alleged role in the Libor rate-rigging scandal. HSBC was subpoenaed in August by New York's attorney general.</p>

<p>Barclays, the first bank to settle with regulators, paid U.K. and U.S. regulators $453 million in penalties for rigging Libor. The bank's CEO resigned in the wake of that announcement.</p>
