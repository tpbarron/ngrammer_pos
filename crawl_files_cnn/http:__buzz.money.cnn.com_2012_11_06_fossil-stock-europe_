<p>Fossil's stock took a beating Tuesday, making it the second-worst performer on the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP), after the company reported weak revenue and cut back its sales outlook for the current quarter.</p>

<p>Fossil (FOSL) reported third-quarter sales of $684.2 million, falling short of the $713.1 million analysts had expected. Earnings fared better. Fossil beat earnings-per-share forecasts by 9 cents. But Europe, once again, reared its ugly head and took a big bite out of the company's sales.</p>

<p>A stronger U.S. dollar was also to blame for the sales shortfall, which Fossil said resulted in a decrease of $22.2 million in overall third-quarter sales.</p>

<p>One bright spot remains Asia, where sales rose nearly 27%.</p>

<p>Still, that wasn't enough to keep investors and StockTwits traders from weighing in.</p>

<p>firstadopter: $FOSL call: their retail stores in Europe getting better due to traffic from new jewelry offerings (wholesale biz is where weakening is)</p>

<p>Wholesale sales were barely higher so if Fossil can make it up with foot traffic to its stores then there is room to turn things around before year-end. And even though the company trimmed back its sales forecast, Fossil still expects a 12% increase in the fourth quarter. That's not too shabby.</p>

<p>bradloncar: $FOSL makes a quality product for a good price. Not the type of company I'd want to short regardless of an earnings report or two.</p>

<p>That might be a very good point. Just six months ago, Fossil's stock sank nearly 40% for the exact same reason: Europe. But fast forward to August, when the stock rallied 30% on a strong earnings report.</p>

<p>But not everyone was sold on Fossil's ability to turn things around.</p>

<p>Berserker $FOSL When is the last time you saw a fossil commercial? 1996???</p>

<p>Fossil has made some notable acquisitions and shouldn't be written off just yet. Earlier this year, Fossil acquired Skagen, which makes watches and other accessories. And the company has had a long-standing relationship with Michael Kors (KORS), DKNY, Armani and others.</p>
