<p>Whole Foods (WFM) warned shareholders that it will take a one-time charge for losses related to Hurricane Sandy. Investors raced out of the stock, causing it to drop more than 5% Thursday.</p>

<p>The Sandy-related worries forced investors to ignore an otherwise solid quarter in which sales spiked 24%. Sales at stores open for more than one year jumped 8.5%, and profits rose 49%. Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said the retailer's pace of opening new stores continues to increase.</p>

<p>With today as a glaring exception, investors have generally been as giddy about the grocer's stock as many consumers are at its perpetually packed salad bars. The stock is up more than 30% this year.</p>
