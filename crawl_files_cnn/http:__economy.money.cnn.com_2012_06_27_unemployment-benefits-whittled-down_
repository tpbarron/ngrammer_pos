<p>Many long-term unemployed will begin seeing their federal jobless benefits disappear starting this week.</p>

<p>Although Congress reauthorized federal emergency unemployment benefits earlier this year, lawmakers reduced the weeks the jobless can collect payments. The cutbacks come in two phases -- one now and another in September.</p>

<p>This round affects the jobless in at least 24 states, while all Americans will be affected in the fall.</p>

<p>Now, those who live in states with unemployment rates below 6% are eligible to receive a maximum of 46 weeks of benefits, down from 60. (This includes up to 26 weeks of state benefits.)</p>

<p>Those in states with unemployment rates between 6% and 7% will receive up to 60 weeks, down from 73.</p>

<p>And the jobless who live in states with unemployment rates between 8.5% and 9% will be eligible for as many as 73 weeks, instead of 79.</p>

<p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities laid out the number of weeks residents of each state are eligible for in this map:</p>

<p>These changes are on top of the disappearance of the federal extended benefits, which lasted up to 20 weeks. Nearly half a million people have already lost these benefits this year, and payments will likely end in the remaining four states over the summer.</p>
