<p>The decline of union membership has been a key driver of income inequality in recent decades, a new report found.</p>

<p>The drop in unionization accounts for roughly a third of the growth in wage inequality among men and a fifth among women between 1973 and 2007, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.</p>

<p>The share of the workforce represented by unions declined from 26.7% in 1973 to 13.1% in 2011. This contributed to the increase in inequality by lowering wages for middle class workers, according to EPI.</p>

<p>A non-partisan Congressional Budget Office report last year showed that the average household income for the nation's top 1% more than tripled, while middle-class incomes grew by less than 40% between 1979 to 2007.</p>

<p>The pullback in unionization has also been a primary cause of the growing wage gap between white- and blue-collar men, as well as between college-educated and high school-educated men.</p>

<p>"Unions reduce wage inequalities because they raise wages more at the bottom and in the middle of the wage scale than at the top," said Lawrence Mishel, EPI's president.</p>

<p>Declining unionization has hurt men more than women because men were more likely to have been in unions in their heyday.</p>

<p>Union workers are paid a premium of 13.6% thanks to their collective bargaining contracts, according to EPI.</p>

<p>Blacks and Hispanics enjoy premiums of 17.3% and 23.1%, respectively, while whites have a 10.9% bump. Men see a 17.3% premium and women 9.1%.</p>

<p>This advantage is calculated by comparing hourly wages between union and non-union workers who are otherwise comparable in terms of experience, education, industry and other factors.</p>
