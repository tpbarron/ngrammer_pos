<p>As we prepare to cover the jobs report on Friday, we're looking for real people to share their stories about the job market. Did you get a job recently? Tweet your story to @CNNMoney with the hashtag #igotajob.</p>

<p>With 12.5 million Americans still unemployed, it's tough out there to say the least. But as I monitor Twitter, I'm encouraged to find some uplifting stories.</p>

<p>Take for instance Janel Porter of Louisville, Ky. who searched for two years and finally landed a job as a data entry worker at Humana. It's a temp job, but she's thankful for the fresh start.</p>

<p>hey twitter! i've got a job!!! finally--begins monday. i'll be a data entry person...— JustPerfectBeauty (@jstprfectbeauty) September 26, 2012</p>

<p>Then there's Jack DeManche of Boston, Ma. who was hired as a social media manager for DailyBreak.com, soon after he graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>

<p>@AnnCensky I studied Communication at @UMassAmherst and now I head up the social media and user experience for @DailybreakInc!— Jack DeManche (@GenuineJack) September 26, 2012</p>

<p>Congratulations to these Tweeters, and remember to share your story with @CNNMoney too. Economists surveyed by CNNMoney predict the next jobs report will show employers created 110,000 jobs in September.</p>
