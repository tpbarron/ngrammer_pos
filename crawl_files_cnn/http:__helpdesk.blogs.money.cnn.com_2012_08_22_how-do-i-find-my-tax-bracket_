<p>How can I find out which tax bracket I'm in? — Joe</p>

<p>Go straight to the source: the Internal Revenue Service. Form 1040-ES, which you can find on irs.gov, offers a handy table on page 6 to figure out your tax bracket whether you're a single filer, married filing jointly or separately, or head of household. For example, if you are a single filer with an adjusted gross income between $35,351 and $85,650, you can expect to be in the 25% tax bracket — at least for this year. With the Bush-era tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year, it's anyone's guess where income tax rates will be as of January 1.</p>
