<p>I've read that junk bonds can act more like stocks than bonds. When do they? — Douglas Earle</p>

<p>All bond prices rise and fall as a result of interest-rate changes, but junk bonds are also sensitive to something else, notes Matt Conti of Fidelity Focused High Income Fund: shifts in how investors feel about the ability of the company issuing the bond to repay borrowers. So news that would hit a shaky company's stock — poor earnings, say — would hammer its debt too.</p>

<p>Junk bonds pay higher interest rates than so-called investment-grade debt does because their risk of default is higher (still, over the past year, junk's default rate has been about 3%). Today, junk's 5% to 12% yields are tempting. Just keep in mind that if investors sour on the company or the economy, junk bond prices can fall sharply — as they did in 2009, when junk bonds fell 26% in value.</p>
