<p>We may emigrate overseas, and there is a possibility that my daughters may not attend higher education in the U.S. If that is the case, can 529 funds be used overseas, or would I need to withdraw the funds and incur the penalties? — James M.</p>

<p>Many overseas institutions are eligible under the 529 rules, according to Joseph Hurley, a CPA and founder of Savingforcollege.com. You can search a list of eligible institutions provided by the U.S. Department of Education at the Federal Student Aid website (https://fafsa.ed.gov/FAFSA/app/schoolSearch). Under the "State" tab, select "Foreign Country" and hit "Search." You'll find about 450 school listed, ranging from Aarhus University in Denmark to York University in Toronto.</p>

<p>If an international institution qualifies for 529 funds, you can use your plan to cover tuition, mandatory fees, and — if your plan allows — other costs such as room and board. Not all 529 plans are created equal, however, and if you have a pre-paid 529 plan (as opposed to a 529 savings plan) you may not be able to apply the full value of the plan to out-of-state — or out-of-country — institutions.</p>

<p>If you do decide to withdraw the money from your plan to use for a non-eligible institution, or for non-eligible expenses, you will have to pay income tax and a 10% penalty on any earnings you withdraw.</p>
