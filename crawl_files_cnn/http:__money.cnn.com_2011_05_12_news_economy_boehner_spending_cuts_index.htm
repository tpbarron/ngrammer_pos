<p>House Speaker John Boehner has said "everything is on the table" except tax increases. That makes a deal on debt hard to reach and debt reduction hard to accomplish.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Trillions in spending cuts. No tax increases. No kidding.</p>

<p>That is House Speaker John Boehner's opening bid in negotiations over raising the debt ceiling.</p>

<p>Politically, the Boehner parameters aren't likely to fly. President Obama and other Democrats have already made clear they want to reduce debt through a combination of spending cuts and increased tax revenue.</p>

<p>But practically, can the country live with a regimen of spending cuts alone? It's unlikely, since the changes could end up being too severe to be palatable, fiscal experts say.</p>

<p>Just to keep the country's total debt where it is now -- around 60% of GDP -- without tax increases, lawmakers would need to cut spending today by 35% or about $1.2 trillion, according to the Government Accountability Office.</p>

<p>That's almost as much as what the country spends on defense and other discretionary spending -- i.e., nearly everything Americans expect their federal government to do outside of providing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that stabilizing public debt at 60% likely won't be enough because it's still well above the country's historical average -- which is under 40%. Translation: Even more cutting would be necessary in subsequent decades.</p>

<p>Another reason that a spending-cuts-only debt-reduction plan may not be the best option: It likely would require less of a sacrifice from the wealthy than from everyone else.</p>

<p>And any plan lawmakers agree to has to be seen as credible by the markets since the push to bring deficits down is driven by a fear that bond investors at some point may turn tail on U.S. Treasurys.</p>

<p>A Reuters survey this week suggests that spending cuts alone wouldn't fly. A majority of bond firm economists and fund managers said that tax increases, in addition to spending cuts, must be part of the solution.</p>

<p>It's not clear how many trillions Boehner and the GOP will aim for in spending cuts or over what time period.</p>

<p>Capitol Hill aides believe lawmakers will seek a $2 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, and Boehner has said spending cuts will need to exceed any debt ceiling increase.</p>

<p>If the GOP's demands for spending cuts end up in the $2 trillion range over 10 years, that would be on par with the amount of spending cuts called for by President Obama's bipartisan debt commission, not including interest savings.</p>

<p>The commission proposed $1.2 trillion worth of discretionary spending cuts that leaned most heavily on defense. It also called for $400 billion in health savings and roughly $300 billion in mandatory spending cuts, said Marc Goldwein, policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget who also worked on the fiscal commission staff.</p>

<p>But here's the catch: The Democrats who supported the proposal did so because it was part of a comprehensive plan that included revenue increases.</p>

<p>It's also not clear whether Republicans will eventually agree to curb tax breaks, which many consider a form a government spending through the tax code. The elimination of such breaks -- a key element in the debt commission's proposal -- is a way to raise more revenue without actually raising tax rates. (Blowing up the tax code.)</p>

<p>Sen. Jon Kyl, who is part of the debt ceiling negotiations led by Vice President Joe Biden, suggested in a radio show with Larry Kudlow that the debt ceiling talks may not be the best forum to discuss tax reform.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure this is the place to do that.... We will not consider tax increases as a part of this discussion," Kyl said. "As a result, it's a little difficult to talk about pro-growth tax reform because one of the elements is the elimination of ... tax expenditures. When you do that somebody's taxes actually go up."Â </p>
