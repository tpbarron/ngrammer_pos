<p>John Krech, 45, Minneapolis Then: Business team leader at 3M. Now: Inventory-management software developer.</p>

<p>(Money Magazine) -- While managing supply lines for 3M, John Krech realized that existing inventory-management software was using outdated financial formulas.</p>

<p>So around 2006, the numbers junkie began filling his bedroom walls with equations, aiming to create something better.</p>

<p>He quit 3M in April 2008 and by year's end introduced desktop software to help small, inventory-heavy businesses determine how much to order and when.</p>

<p>In 2011, he replaced that with Right On Inventory Order Management, now offered as an app for Intuit's Quick Books. (He's applied for a patent.)</p>

<p>Given demand so far -- and Brighton's price of $30 per user per month -- Krech expects revenue to leap from $126,000 in 2010 to $500,000 this year; he hopes to pay himself $100,000, nearly matching his old salary.</p>

<p>"Solving a problem by creating something has been tremendous," he says. "I've found my calling."</p>

<p>1. By drawing on his nest egg.</p>

<p>Krech figured he'd need $350,000 to get off the ground. But potential investors wanted too big a stake, and loans were hard to come by.</p>

<p>So he emptied his 401(ok), despite a hefty tax bill, a 10% penalty, and the risks to his retirement.</p>

<p>2. By living sparely.</p>

<p>A divorced dad of two, Krech cut personal expenses by 40%, which included selling his house and moving in with his fiancee.</p>

<p>He reasons he's "living for a few years like most people won't, so I can live the rest of my life like most people can't."</p>

<p>3. By building on a successful platform.</p>

<p>Creating a Quick Books app provided him access to a ready-made audience. And the monthly fee regulates revenue.</p>

<p>Besides, he notes, "by positioning myself with Intuit, I'm in a position to be an attractive acquisition." Â </p>
