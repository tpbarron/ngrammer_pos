<p>Former PayPal employees Stephanie Tilenius and Osama Bedier, seen here at this week's Google Wallet launch, are at the center of a lawsuit alleging trade-secret theft.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- PayPal and its parent company eBay sued Google this week. The company claims that two of its former top executives violated their contracts by sharing confidential information with Google and by negotiating with Google despite a clear conflict of interest.</p>

<p>California courts are famously unfriendly to employee non-compete agreements -- which means eBay will have a hard fight to prove its case. Here's a timeline of what eBay says happened, based on the details provided in its lawsuit.</p>

<p>March 12, 2001: Stephanie Tilenius joins eBay's staff and signs the company's non-disclosure agreement (NDA), agreeing not to solicit any eBay (EBAY, Fortune 500) employees for one year after leaving the company and not to disclose confidential eBay information.</p>

<p>Nov. 13, 2002: Osama Bedier begins work at PayPal and signs an NDA. He eventually becomes a vice president in charge of bringing mobile payment technology and services to retailers.</p>

<p>Oct. 16, 2009: Tilenius resigns as eBay's vice president of North America and global products, and she reaffirms the NDA she signed in 2001. Though she stops working for eBay on a full time basis, she stays on as a consultant for the company.</p>

<p>July 15, 2010: Tilenius begins attempting to lure Bedier away from PayPal to work for her at Google.

<p>Aug. 25, 2010: Tilenius asks Bedier in a Facebook message if he wants to speak with Google Senior Vice President Jeff Huber.</p>

<p>Nov. 12, 2010: Google sends Bedier a formal offer of employment, but he does not immediately accept it.</p>

<p>Nov. 19, 2010: Bedier asks Tilenius whether he could bring PayPal co-workers over to Google with him in an e-mail saying, "If folks want to join me on day one -- how possible is this?"</p>

<p>Nov. 27, 2010: Tilenius sends Bedier a text message saying "By next week there will be more information I can share and you will see how the role at Google could be expanded considerably."

"We respect trade secrets, and will defend ourselves against these claims."Â </p>
