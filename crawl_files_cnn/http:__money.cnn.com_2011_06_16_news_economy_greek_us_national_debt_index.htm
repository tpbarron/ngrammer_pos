<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Deficit hawks often cite Greece's debt nightmare as a cautionary tale for the United States.</p>

<p>But is the United States really like Greece?</p>

<p>The differences between the countries, after all, give the United States some built-in advantages when it comes to managing its debt.</p>

<p>The U.S. economy? Gargantuan. Greece's economy? Tiny.</p>

<p>Plus, the United States' earning capacity is greater since it has a more diverse economy than Greece does, said Barry Anderson, who used to run a budgeting and public expenditures division at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>

<p>There are also big differences in the countries' currencies.</p>

<p>The dollar is the world's reserve currency and is managed by a single government.</p>

<p>The euro, by contrast, is used by 17 sovereign countries. Therefore, Greece's monetary policy is set not according to Greece's needs but by the needs of stronger economies -- especially Germany -- that prefer higher interest rates as a bulwark against inflation.(See correction below.)</p>

<p>The OECD, meanwhile, estimates that U.S. net debt will reach 75% of the country's economy this year. That number includes federal, state and local debt but excludes debt owed to government trust funds such as Social Security.</p>

<p>Greece's debt, by contrast, will be around 125%.</p>

<p>So what's the concern for the United States exactly?</p>

<p>"The real fundamental similarity is trend. Both [countries' fiscal situations] are bad and getting worse," Anderson said.</p>

<p>That's because both the United States and Greece have aging populations and mature economies that aren't likely to grow as much as they have in the past.</p>

<p>Simply assuming that the United States will remain forever immune from the perils of too much debt is not a winning strategy, deficit hawks warn.</p>

<p>Of course, that's a hard case to make when investors embrace Treasuries every time they get spooked by turmoil in Europe. Events in Greece in recent days have driven the 10-year Treasury yield below 3%.</p>

<p>In other words, the United States continues to get the benefit of being a "safe haven" compared to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>But experts believe that investors won't always give Americans the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>"The markets do react late, but when they react they react pretty sharply," said Carlos Cottarelli, director of fiscal affairs at the International Monetary Fund, during a Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget conference this week.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, investors' fears that Greece would ever default were considerably lower than they are today. So it's not surprising that the yield on 10-year Greek bonds is now pushing 18%, up from 6% at the start of 2010, according to Bloomberg markets data.</p>

<p>But even if U.S. rates don't rise soon -- and some say they won't because investors fear slower economic growth -- that doesn't mean markets can't find other ways to hurt the United States, Anderson said.</p>

<p>Investors might choose to punish the dollar if they start to believe Congress doesn't have the political will to do what's required to put the U.S. budget on a more sustainable track.</p>

<p>And a substantially weaker dollar would have all sorts of negative repercussions, including a possible credit downgrade from ratings agencies, said Michael Pond, managing director of fixed income strategy at Barclays Capital, at the CRFB conference.</p>

<p>The bottom line: The U.S. is not Greece in many ways. But it's also not immune from the punishing effects of debt.</p>
