<p>Snooki is launching a new line of flip flops, sunglasses and additional slipper styles later this year.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- With her tan, pouf and penchant for pickles, Snooki has made her mark on America.</p>

<p>But now Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, star of MTV's hit "Jersey Shore," is taking her fame a step further with a line of flip-flops due out this fall.</p>

<p>The reality star is following on the heels of the signature slippers she launched last year with a collection of wedges, sandals and thongs well suited for the beach.</p>

<p>The footwear will retail for $15 and $50, and come in a variety of classic Snooki styles from a pickle pattern to leopard print.</p>

<p>"Anything new is exciting for the industry, and when there's a celebrity behind it, it tends to do fairly well," said Brian Curin, president of the retail chain Flip Flop Shops.</p>

<p>The well branded Polizzi is currently in Florence, Italy, filming the fourth season of "Jersey Shore." She is also planning a line of sunglasses that will be available later this summer.</p>

<p>Her best-selling book "A Shore Thing," will be released in paperback June 28, and additional slipper styles are also coming soon, according to her manager, Danny Mackey at Neon Entertainment.Â </p>
