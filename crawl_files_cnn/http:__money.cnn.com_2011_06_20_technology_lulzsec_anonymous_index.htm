<p>LulzSec has adopted a pirate logo and theme for its running commentary about its hack attacks.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Hacking groups Lulz Security and Anonymous have teamed up to target governments around the globe in what they're calling "Operation Anti-Security."</p>

<p>LulzSec unveiled its new partnership in a blog post declaring "immediate and unremitting war." The revolution will be tweeted: #AntiSec lit up Monday with comments about the campaign.</p>

<p>"Top priority is to steal and leak any classified government information, including e-mail spools and documentation," LulzSec declared in its post. "Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments."</p>

<p>The group first targeted the U.K.-based Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA), crashing the site Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>"The Lulz Boat Tango down - soca.gov.uk - in the name of #AntiSec," LulzSec tweeted regarding the attack.</p>

<p>The onslaught that crashed SOCA is called a "distributed denial of service" (DDoS) attack. It's an unsophisticated but effective way of knocking a website offline by directing a firehose of traffic at the site.</p>

<p>DDoS attacks are a favorite tool of Anonymous, a decentralized global group of "hacktivists" that use a linked network of PCs to crash the websites of those they deem enemies. The group has used such attacks to take down websites including Mastercard and Visa.</p>

<p>LulzSec is a previously unknown hacking collective that burst onto the scene last month with a series of attacks against high-profile sites. Its hacks -- which so far have hit targets include Sony (SNE), PBS, and the U.S. Senate -- typically involve actually breaking into targeted sites and grabbing internal data from their servers. A DDoS attack, in contrast, doesn't compromise a website's security defenses -- it simply overwhelms its servers. LuzSec itself seemed to recognize that a DDoS attack wasn't a very threatening start to what it claims will be an historic cyberwar.</p>

<p>"DDoS is of course our least powerful and most abundant ammunition," the group tweeted Monday. "Government hacking is taking place right now behind the scenes. #AntiSec"Â </p>
