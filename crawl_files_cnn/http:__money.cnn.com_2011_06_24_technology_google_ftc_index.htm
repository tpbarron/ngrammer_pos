<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Google went on the defensive about its business practices on Friday as it acknowledged that is the subject of a government probe.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission formally notified Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) this week that it is investigating the company, Google acknowledged in a blog post. Google did not disclose the nature of the inquiry, and said it's "unclear exactly what the FTC's concerns are."</p>

<p>It's likely an antitrust probe, as the company has been subject to many smaller antitrust investigations in the past. This one appears far more wide-reaching.</p>

<p>In its blog post, Google brushed off the notion that it's a search Goliath. It reitered its oft-stated line: "The competition is only one click away."</p>

<p>"We recognize that our success has led to greater scrutiny," the company said. "Using Google is a choice -- and there are lots of other choices available to you for getting information."</p>

<p>The company claims to have lived by its "don't be evil" credo since its founding.</p>

<p>"These are the principles that guide us, and we know they'll stand up to scrutiny," the company said.</p>

<p>Google dominates search in the United States, controlling about two-thirds of the market, according to comScore. It also licenses the world's largest smartphone operating system, and its share of U.S. display advertising revenue recently eclipsed long-time leader Yahoo (YHOO, Fortune 500), according to IDC.</p>

<p>As a result, the company has faced increased regulatory scrutiny. This year alone, a federal judge rejected Google's settlement to create a universal online book library, the Department of Justice heavily scrutinized the company's recent purchase of flight data software company ITA, and Google set aside $500 million for a potential settlement with the DOJ regarding the company's advertising practices. The DOJ is currently studying Google's proposed $400 million purchase of digital advertising toolmaker Admeld.</p>

<p>The Senate's antitrust subcommittee wants to hold a hearing within the next few weeks on "competition issues pertaining to Internet search" -- and it has threatened CEO Larry Page and Chariman Eric Schmidt with subpoenas if they decline to testify.</p>

<p>The company has faced more regulatory scrutiny outside this country as well, most notably from the European Union, which is currently investigating Google for possible antitrust violations.Â </p>
