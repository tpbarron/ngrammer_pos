<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Netflix is rapidly expanding its international service, with plans to launch in 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean later this year.</p>

<p>The new markets -- which include Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean -- will give those members access to Netflix content in Spanish, Portuguese or English. They'll be able to watch "American, local and global TV," Netflix said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The new markets will be streaming-only -- which is Netflix's plan for all international markets, a company spokesman said.</p>

<p>Netflix (NFLX) launched its instant streaming service in the U.S. in 2007, eight years after it launched its DVDs-by-mail service. U.S. Netflix customers can buy a streaming-only subscription for $7.99 per month, or mix streaming and mailed DVDs under plans starting at $9.99 per month.</p>

<p>Netflix made its first international foray in Canada late last year. The company has said for months that it was planning to soon launch in two more international markets.</p>

<p>The Canadian market has been somewhat slow going. In Netflix's first-quarter earnings report, it said it ended the period with about 800,000 Canadian subscribers -- the low end of company forecasts. Netflix said it expects to have 1 million subscribers by the end of the summer.</p>

<p>Canadian telecoms' severe bandwidth caps make streaming video very expensive in the nation.</p>

<p>Netflix had previously said it expected $50 million in operating losses in the second half of the year in the international sector. But in its first-quarter report, it upped that forecast $50 to $70 million in losses -- "which we are comfortable with given the size of the opportunity."Â </p>
