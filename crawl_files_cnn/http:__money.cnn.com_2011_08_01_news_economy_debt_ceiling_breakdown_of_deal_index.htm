<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- There's plenty in it for everyone to hate.</p>

<p>But it will be law by the end of Tuesday.</p>

<p>The debt ceiling deal passed by the House on Monday and by the Senate Tuesday will keep the country out of default and reduce deficits by at least $2.1 trillion over a decade.</p>

<p>Whether the deal might also avert a first-ever credit downgrade for the United States is not clear, since ratings agency Standard & Poor's indicated it was looking for a credible, bipartisan plan that had at least $4 trillion of debt reduction.</p>

<p>The plan includes no tax or entitlement reform measures up front, although theoretically it leaves the door open to both.</p>

<p>A debt ceiling increase of between $2.1 trillion and $2.4 trillion: The framework will raise the debt ceiling immediately by $400 billion, then by another $500 billion after September.</p>

<p>After deep cuts are enacted by the end of the year, it will be increased by another $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion.</p>

<p>All told, the increases should cover the Treasury's borrowing needs until 2013.</p>

<p>At least $2.1 trillion in spending cuts: The framework will immediately cap domestic and defense spending, resulting in cuts of $917 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>The framework then calls for more deficit reduction -- between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion worth -- to be determined by the end of this year and imposed over 10 years.</p>

<p>Bipartisan debt-reduction committee: That second round of deficit reduction would be proposed by a special bipartisan joint committee of Congress. The committee has until Thanksgiving to come up with its proposals and those proposals would be guaranteed by an up-or-down vote without amendment by Dec. 23.</p>

<p>If the committee proposes and the Congress approves between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion in cuts, the debt ceiling will be increased dollar for dollar.</p>

<p>If the committee deadlocks or comes up with less than $1.2 trillion in cuts, or if Congress votes down the committee's proposals, the debt ceiling will be raised by $1.2 trillion.</p>

<p>While it appears the committee will be free to consider entitlement and tax reform -- and dare we say it, tax hikes -- practically speaking it's more likely members would hit an impasse over these measures just as they have, oh, every other day this year.</p>

<p>Across-the-board cuts as trigger: If the committee deadlocks or fails to come up with at least $1.2 trillion in debt reduction, the sword of Damocles will fall on most forms of spending in the federal budget.</p>

<p>Specifically, as much as $1.2 trillion in across-the-board cuts would kick in -- evenly divided between defense and non-defense spending. (Video: U.S. is 'debt man walking')</p>

<p>Exempt from this round of cuts, however, will be programs that aid low-income Americans, according to Democrats' fact sheets. These include Social Security, Medicaid, veterans' benefits and pensions, food stamps and Supplemental Security Income.</p>

<p>While Medicare would not be exempt, the framework would restrict cuts to no more than 2% of the program's cost. And the cuts that occur would not affect Medicare benefits nor would they increase seniors' costs, according to the White House fact sheet.</p>

<p>Required vote on balanced budget amendment: In theory, the across-the-board cuts could be avoided if instead both chambers of Congress pass a Balanced Budget amendment to the Constitution and send it to the states for ratification before the end of the year.</p>

<p>But for a host of reasons, political and substantive, that's very unlikely to happen.Â </p>
