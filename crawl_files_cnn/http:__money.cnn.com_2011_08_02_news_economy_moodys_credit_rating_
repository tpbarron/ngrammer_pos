<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Credit rating agency Moody's said Tuesday the United States will keep its sterling AAA credit rating for the time being, but lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to "negative."</p>

<p>A "negative outlook" indicates the possibility that Moody's would downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two.</p>

<p>The rating agency, which had placed U.S. debt rating on review for a possible downgrade last month, said the political deal to raise the debt ceiling has now "virtually eliminated the risk of such a default."</p>

<p>Even with the risk of default gone, Moody's said lawmakers need to take additional steps -- and keep to their promises.</p>

<p>The second round of spending cuts included in the debt ceiling deal need to be enacted, Moody's said, while expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of the so-called trigger mechanism.</p>

<p>"Should the new mechanism put in place by the Budget Control Act prove ineffective, this could affect the rating negatively," Moody's said in a statement.</p>

<p>And the United States should lower its debt-to-GDP ratio. Moody's said it expects to see debt stabilize at 73% of GDP by the middle of the decade and then decline.</p>

<p>And interest rates must remain under control. If borrowing costs for the U.S. government spike beyond expectations, that would "also be negative" for the rating.</p>

<p>The United States enjoys its AAA rating in part for having always stood behind its debt and paid its bills on time. As a result, U.S. Treasury bonds are considered the world's safe-haven investment.</p>

<p>Rating agencies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- analyze risk and give debt a "grade" that reflects the borrower's ability to pay the underlying loans.</p>

<p>The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States a AAA rating in 1917.</p>

<p>The move by Moody's comes after an ugly debate in Washington over whether to raise the country's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.</p>

<p>Congress reached an agreement on Sunday, as the Treasury Department was days away from reaching its borrowing limit. President Obama signed the eleventh-hour bill Tuesday.</p>

<p>S&P has yet to weigh in on the debt ceiling deal.Â </p>
