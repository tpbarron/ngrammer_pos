<p>Lesley Bowers, 62, Lewes, Del. Then: Radio station ad sales manager. Now: Owner of a pet accessories store.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- When the industry she knew started going to the dogs, Lesley Bowers decided to follow suit. After 20 lucrative years in radio sales -- at her peak, she doubled her $100,000 salary with a bonus --she began tiring of the pressure. "It was becoming too bottom-line driven," she says.</p>

<p>After deciding to quit, the devoted dog owner began tossing around the idea of a pet accessory boutique. Setting an example for a college finance class she was teaching at Howard University in 2004, Bowers wrote up a business plan.</p>

<p>A year later she opened P.U.P.S. ("Pawsitively Unique Pet Shop") of Lewes, which carries everything from organic treats to NFL team collars.</p>

<p>This year she expects sales of $250,000 and will take a salary for the first time -- about $20,000. It's been a big shift, but Bowers wasn't unprepared: "I'd never opened a store," she jokes, "but I had changed formats in radio."</p>

<p>1. By minimizing her investment.</p>

<p>Starting out with a tiny 250-square-foot space -- and rent of $650 a month --Bowers took just $10,000 from savings for inventory and overhead. Her husband, Sam, a TV ad salesman turned carpenter, handled renovations.</p>

<p>2. By keeping her second job.</p>

<p>Bowers still teaches at Howard, taking in $36,000 a year. With their house paid for and her stepchildren grown, that income plus Sam's carpentry earnings covers the couple's expenses, allowing her to reinvest most of her earnings.</p>

<p>3. By marketing creatively.</p>

<p>Bowers devised inexpensive attention-getting events. Among them: an annual BarkFest (including a pet pageant), a Yappy Hour (complete with Mutt-inis), and even a dog reenactment of the royal wedding (the town mayor officiated).</p>
