<p>Goodbye, AAA.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Credit rating agency Standard and Poor's made good on its saber-rattling on Friday, and downgraded U.S. debt.</p>

<p>The move is unprecedented -- and the effects unclear.</p>

<p>So what exactly is going on here?</p>

<p>Rating agencies -- S&P, Moody's and Fitch -- analyze risk and give debt a "grade" that reflects the borrower's ability to pay the underlying loans. The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where U.S. debt has stood for years.</p>

<p>Moody's first assigned the United States a AAA rating in 1917. The country's new S&P rating is AA+ -- still strong, but not the highest.</p>

<p>The downgrade puts the U.S. debt rating on par with that of Belgium, but below countries like the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>

<p>Why did this happen now? S&P gave two primary reasons for downgrading U.S. debt: The nation's fiscal path and its broken political system.</p>

<p>The agency has been harping on those two issues for months. S&P argues that the U.S. debt-to-GDP trajectory is unsustainable, and that the politics involved are so caustic that lawmakers are unable to make the tough choices needed to correct the problem.</p>

<p>During the debt ceiling debate, lawmakers blew their big chance to make a difference.</p>

<p>To avoid a downgrade, S&P said the United States needed to not only raise the debt ceiling, but also develop a "credible" plan to tackle the nation's long-term debt.</p>

<p>The agency has indicated it preferred a deal that would have reduced deficits by $4 trillion over ten years. Instead, lawmakers settled for a measure that will cut only $2.5 trillion.</p>

<p>What does a downgrade mean for my finances? Well, it's tough to say. Remember, this has never happened before to the United States.</p>

<p>And it doesn't necessarily mean disaster for your money. The United States has not been downgraded to "junk" status, like say, Greece. The rating is still very high -- just not tops.</p>

<p>Bottom line -- it's not going to help matters, especially with the economy already in a soft patch.</p>

<p>Some reaction is expected in the stock market. Major indexes around the world were battered last week, and a downgrade can only increase uncertainty and fear.</p>

<p>It's unclear how the Treasury market will react. Some experts think yields could spike -- and that could impact consumers by leading to rate hikes on items like car loans, mortgages and student loans.</p>

<p>But others predict investors will shrug off the downgrade. Why? Because the U.S. fiscal situation is well known, and S&P is not basing its rating on any information that is not already available.</p>

<p>Can the U.S. return to a AAA rating? It can! But it will be tough, and it won't happen for a while.</p>

<p>John Chambers, the head of sovereign ratings at S&P, told CNN that his agency's decision is likely to have a long-term impact.</p>

<p>"Once you lose your AAA, it doesn't usually bounce back," he said.</p>

<p>It's unclear exactly what steps are needed to change S&P's mind. A source familiar with the discussion said Friday evening that the rating agency had not discussed a return to AAA status with the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Was this avoidable? Yes.</p>

<p>S&P has gone out of its way to point to the political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling as a key reason for the downgrade.</p>

<p>That puts the blame squarely on lawmakers -- and the political culture they cultivate and participate in.</p>

<p>"The first thing [lawmakers] could have done is to have raised the debt ceilng in a timely manner so that much of this debate had been avoided to begin with, as it had done 60 or 70 times since 1960 without that much debate," Chambers said.</p>

<p>Is one party to blame over the other?</p>

<p>"This is a problem that's been a long time in the making," Chambers said</p>

<p>In a sign that message had not been received, lawmakers and candidates for political office issued a slew of partisan statements Friday night, casting blame and throwing rhetorical stones just hours after the downgrade was announced.Â </p>
