<p>Marci Zimmerman, 48, Phoenix. THEN: Executive at a nonprofit. NOW: Owner of a tattoo-removal salon.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- Marci Zimmerman was sitting in the stands at a baseball game one blazing hot afternoon in 2003 when she saw something that made an indelible impression on her.</p>

<p>Surrounded by sweaty fans shedding their shirts, and "looking around at all the bad tattoos, I thought, 'Someday, tattoo removal is going to be a huge business,' " she says.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, Zimmerman, an executive at the nonprofit Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, tested her hypothesis.</p>

<p>She scoured research reports (including one showing that about 20% of tattoo bearers regret their markings); studied removal methods; and interviewed plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and tattoo artists to find out where they sent folks who wanted their tats taken off.</p>

<p>"I followed the trail," she says, "and didn't see any business like what I wanted to do." Zimmerman had previously led marketing efforts at the Marriott hotel chain, and her experience in hospitality gave her the idea for a clinic that looked like a spa.</p>

<p>"I wanted to create a space that was warm and inviting, and didn't look like just another medical office."</p>

<p>In 2009, she quit her job and plunked down $9,000 for a two-week class about laser technology.</p>

<p>Soon after, she signed a lease on a $1,500-a-month, 1,200-square-foot space in central Phoenix; put down 20% on a $100,000 laser; and contracted a doctor to operate it.</p>

<p>Delete -- Tattoo Removal & Laser Salon opened in November 2010. Charging $100 per four square inches of work, the salon took in $16,000 its first month; this June, sales hit $70,000, thanks to Zimmerman's marketing efforts.</p>

<p>This year, she expects revenue of $400,000. Next year, with plans to open two more outlets, she projects taking a salary of $100,000, two-thirds of what she used to earn. Her ambitious goal: to build a business worth $15 million in five years by opening around 50 stores.</p>

<p>While working toward that plan, Zimmerman is having an adventure getting to know her customers. (One of her most memorable clients: the guy who came in to have the word "slumlord" removed from his knuckles.) As she says, "Every tattoo has a story behind it." Â </p>
