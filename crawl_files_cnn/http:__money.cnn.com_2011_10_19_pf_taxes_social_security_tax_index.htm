<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Seniors got good news on Wednesday: Their Social Security checks will go up 3.6% next year because of a cost-of-living increase.</p>

<p>That also means an estimated 10 million high-income workers may be paying a bigger tax bill.</p>

<p>That's because the inflation that justifies the benefit increase also will raise the amount of income subject to the portion of the payroll tax supporting Social Security.</p>

<p>Currently workers pay the tax on the first $106,800 of income. Starting next year, they will pay it on the first $110,100.</p>

<p>Normally the tax rate is 6.2% for workers and 6.2% for employers. Those who are self-employed pay the full 12.4%.</p>

<p>But this year workers have only paid 4.2% thanks to a temporary payroll tax holiday that Congress passed last December.</p>

<p>It's not clear yet what the rate for 2012 will be. If President Obama has his way, it will be temporarily cut even further -- to 3.1%. Otherwise it may be maintained at 4.2% or revert to 6.2% as it is scheduled to under current law.</p>

<p>This year, people making $110,100 are paying $4,486 into Social Security.</p>

<p>Next year, if the rate reverts to 6.2%, they'd pay $2,341 more.</p>

<p>If the rate stays at 4.2%, they'd pay $139 more.</p>

<p>And if it's reduced to 3.1%, they'd pay $1,073 less.</p>

<p>Proponents who support an extended payroll tax holiday say letting it expire would hurt the economy.</p>

<p>Opponents say the idea is not very effective as economic stimulus.</p>

<p>To help close Social Security's long-term financing shortfall, budget experts have recommended increasing the amount of income subject to the payroll tax.</p>

<p>One proposal is to raise the cap to a level where the payroll tax is covering 90% of wages earned in the country, as it used to for years.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, Obama's fiscal commission proposed raising the cap gradually so that it covers 90% of wages by 2050. Under that proposal the taxable maximum would be $190,000 in 2020, up from the $168,000 currently projected.Â </p>
