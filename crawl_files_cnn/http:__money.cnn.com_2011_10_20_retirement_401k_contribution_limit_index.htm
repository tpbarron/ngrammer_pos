<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- You'll be able to contribute more tax-free money to your 401(k) next year, the IRS announced Thursday.</p>

<p>The contribution limit for employees participating in pension plans -- including 401(k)s, 403(b)s, most 457 plans and the federal government's Thrift Savings Plan will be $17,000 for tax year 2012.</p>

<p>That's $500 higher than the $16,500 limit this year, and marks the first increase since 2009, the IRS said. The reason? Rising inflation.</p>

<p>And pension contribution limits aren't the only amounts the agency has had to boost due to the rising cost of living.</p>

<p>Starting in 2012, taxpayers will also be allowed to claim personal exemptions of $3,800 -- up $100 from 2011, the IRS also announced Thursday.</p>

<p>The new standard deduction will be raised by $300 for married couples, by $150 for singles and by $200 for heads of household. Tax bracket thresholds will also be higher for 2012.</p>

<p>The maximum Earned Income Tax Credit is $5,891 for 2012, up from $5,751 in 2011. And the qualifying income limit has been boosted as well -- to $50,270 in 2012, from $49,078 this year. Several other tax benefits -- including the foreign income deduction and the annual deductible amounts for Medical Savings Accounts -- will also go up.</p>

<p>Other benefits, including the additional standard deduction for blind people and senior citizens, remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Many senior citizens will be helped in another way next year, however. Social Security recipients will receive a cost of living adjustment of 3.6% starting in January -- the first raise in three years. Â </p>
