<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- An increasing number of colleges are charging more than what the average American earns.</p>

<p>The number of colleges and universities with tuition and fees totaling more than $50,000 for a single year rose to 123 for the 2011-2012 year -- up from 100 institutions in the previous year. Meanwhile, the national average wage for American workers stands at a little less than $42,000 a year, according to the Social Security Administration.</p>

<p>In the 2009-2010 academic year, only 58 schools charged more than $50,000 a year, according to College Board data analyzed by the Chronicle of Higher Education. And the year before that, only five colleges dared to put such a high price on their institutions.</p>

<p>Among the elite club of colleges with combined tuition, fees, room and board exceeding $50,000 per year are Ivy leagues like Harvard and Yale, along with liberal arts colleges including Whitman, Williams, Vassar and Oberlin.</p>

<p>Sarah Lawrence College is this year's most expensive school, with a price tag of $59,170. Rounding out the top five most expensive schools are Landmark College (a two-year college in Vermont for students with learning disabilities), New York University, Columbia University and Harvey Mudd College.</p>

<p>Here's the full top ten list:</p>

<p>- Sarah Lawrence College: $59,170</p>

<p>- Landmark College: $57,330</p>

<p>- New York University: $56,787</p>

<p>- Columbia University, School of General Studies: $56,310</p>

<p>- Harvey Mudd College: $56,268</p>

<p>- Wesleyan University: $56,006</p>

<p>- Claremont McKenna College: $55,865</p>

<p>- Johns Hopkins University: $55,742</p>

<p>- Berklee College of Music: $55,615</p>

<p>- Bard College: $55,592</p>

<p>Students were dealt some major tuition hikes. This school year, 39 schools on the list raised tuition, fees room and board by more than 4%, and seven increased costs by more than 5%. The biggest jump, of 10.1%, was seen at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, followed by Berklee College of Music, which raised costs by 8.3%.</p>

<p>Last year, costs rose by more than 4% at 34 schools, and by more than 5% at six schools.</p>

<p>While no public institutions made it into the $50k club this year, that doesn't mean they haven't been hiking tuition.</p>

<p>Given severe budget cuts at many public schools, many state colleges and universities have boosted tuition drastically in the past year. So, while California State University still only costs $9,022 in in-state tuition for a year, that's a whopping 21% increase from the previous year.Â </p>
