<p>Unemployment should ease slightly in 2012, but there are a few concrete steps you can take to help land a job in the new year.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- The unemployment rate is expected to remain uncomfortably elevated in 2012: 8.5%, vs. 9.0% this fall. Yet recruiters and hiring managers say the job market won't be nearly as bad next year as it's been.</p>

<p>Hiring is picking up in several sectors, led by manufacturers that are benefiting from a weak dollar, and technology firms gearing up to meet growing demand from businesses upgrading their software and systems. Health care remains a hiring stalwart, and even nonprofits, which were hit especially hard by funding cuts in 2009 and 2010, are expected to rebound.</p>

<p>The market should also turn up for skilled workers and top performers, as companies are having a surprisingly tough time finding them. And if you're employed, there's some good news too: 97% of organizations plan pay hikes in 2012 -- modest though they may be.</p>

<p>The action plan: Prove to your boss -- or a new employer -- that you have expertise that's in demand</p>

<p>Fill the market's gaps. The shortage of skilled professional workers is a real opportunity. Think you're lacking a key skill set? Find out if there's a job-rotation program at your firm. And work toward certification or training in areas of need at your company.</p>

<p>"It's not easy to find the time to invest if you're working or job hunting, but that kind of initiative gives you a clear advantage," says Geoff Hoffmann, chief operating officer at executive recruiting firm DHR International.</p>

<p>Cover your gaps. If you're unemployed, you'll have a hard time landing jobs with big employment gaps on your résumé. So work your network -- start with your former employers to land project or consulting work, says Jodi Glickman Brown, CEO of Great on the Job.</p>

<p>Raise your profile. You already know how valuable social media are for job hunting. But they can be used to land a promotion or a better-than-average salary bump as well.</p>

<p>For example, use LinkedIn's new skills tool to peruse profiles of higher-ups and top performers at your firm to see what experience they highlight.</p>

<p>Don't know them personally? See if you have mutual connections to meet in person for career advice. Internal networking is hugely valuable: Hiring managers often prefer internal candidates (they're less costly), and referrals from current employees carry weight. </p>
