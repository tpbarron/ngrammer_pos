<p>In 2012, aim to save more, but don't rule out borrowing or applying for rewards cards.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- Let's face it: 2011 was pretty abysmal when it came to savings rates, and 2012 won't be much brighter.</p>

<p>The average savings account barely pays 0.2%, while money-market funds haven't surpassed 0.02% since March. With the Federal Reserve promising to sit on short-term interest rates until at least 2013, don't expect any help from Uncle Sam when it comes to saving.</p>

<p>That means in the coming year, it will be up to you to eke out what little you can in savings rates -- and to preserve those yields from rising bank fees.</p>

<p>While households in general have become smarter about managing their debt --the average card balance dropped by $500 to about $7,000 in 2011 -- "savings don't look particularly healthy," says Richard Barrington of MoneyRates.com. The personal savings rate isn't near its 2007 lows, but it dipped to 3.6% in September. And the pattern of recent months suggests it will continue in that direction next year.</p>

<p>The action plan -- Save wisely, borrow judiciously, and take what the market is giving you</p>

<p>Search for yield. Online banks, with less overhead, are a great place to start. Savings accounts at American Express (AXP, Fortune 500) or Discover Bank (DFS, Fortune 500) yield 1% -- no great shakes but five times the national average.</p>

<p>Also, check out high-yielding checking options at a local bank, where you can often find rates above 2%. There are trade-offs, though. For instance, to get that rate, you may have to commit to making at least 10 debit card transactions a month and sign up for direct deposit.</p>

<p>Search for the best rates where you live at money-rates.com/rewardschecking.htm. Call the bank about terms and qualifications that may apply. Also, visit bankrate.com to make sure the banks you're considering earn at least three stars for safety.</p>

<p>Don't rule out borrowing. "Expect to see aggressive offers from banks, whether it's for a mortgage or a credit card," says Sherief Meleis, a partner at Novantas. In November, for example, the average home-equity loan was charging 6.98%, and credit card APRs went as low as 7%. Be advised, though: Lending standards aren't loosening.</p>

<p>Apply for a rewards card. Your excellent credit score qualifies you for the crème-de-la-crème of offers. Sign-up bonuses are up 25% -- and are expected to stay that way for the coming year, according to NerdWallet.com, which tracks credit card offers.</p>

<p>Don't wait too long to apply; with debit card reform passed, legislators are likely to turn to credit cards next. And who knows how that will affect your perks. </p>
