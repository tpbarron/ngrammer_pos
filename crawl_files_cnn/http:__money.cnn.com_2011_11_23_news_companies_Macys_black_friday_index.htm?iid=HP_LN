<p>Shoppers mob the first floor at Macy's in New York's Herald Square in the first minutes of Black Friday.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Macy's first-ever midnight Thanksgiving opening for Black Friday drew a boisterous crowd -- and even a few protesters -- to its iconic flagship store on Herald Square in New York.</p>

<p>The shoppers began to gather in numbers by early Thursday evening and swelled to an estimated 10,000 just before the doors opened, according to Macy's spokesman Jim Sluzewski.</p>

<p>Good cheer was the rule, despite the hours-long wait to get in.</p>

<p>The buyers came eager to take advantage of deep discounts on clothing, appliances, perfume, jewelry and other goods, including some one-to-a-customer, while-supplies-last deals that promised to be gone by normal opening time.</p>

<p>The store was offering such deals as a free digital video camera with the purchase of $65 worth of fragrance; $199 diamond stud earrings set in white gold; and 40% off selected coffee and espresso makers and tea kettles.</p>

<p>One promotion involved a limited-edition fragrance gift set from Justin Bieber featuring his holiday CD and an exclusive bonus track.</p>

<p>The shoppers seemed glad to be there.</p>

<p>"[Black Friday] is a great holiday," said Keith Kaplan, a grad student at Columbia, who also works for Mashable, a social media news web site. "I love it. It's a fantastic way to boost the economy."</p>

<p>Kaplan didn't even mind the line. "It's good to meet new people," he said. "It's an adrenalin rush."</p>

<p>There were people from all over the world, led by large contingents from China, Western Europe and South America. Gift-buying was only one reason they came.</p>

<p>"We just want to see the madness first hand," said Terry Theo, who was in town from London for a week's vacation with his wife, Maria, and had waited on line for about two hours to witness this slice of Americana.</p>

<p>Many of the overseas visitors seemed to relish the outing more as an anthropological exercise than a buying opportunity.</p>

<p>Pauline Meyer from Switzerland, who was shopping for handbags, said, "We're here to see the event."</p>

<p>Henry Lin, visiting from Guangzhou, China, said, "I'm here to observe American culture -- and maybe, buy a coat."</p>

<p>There was a lot to see.</p>

<p>A group of three family members from Sweden -- Emma, Freda and Emil Askestad and their friend Jonathan Peduru-Aratchi -- stood on 34th Street as a small group of Occupy Wall Street demonstrators swung past chantng an anti-corporate message in their wake. There was a preacher condemning consumerism, hordes of journalists shooting videos and a phalanx of city police keeping the peace.</p>

<p>The Swedes took it all in before breezing inside in search of, mostly, clothes.</p>

<p>There were some serious shoppers, such as Mauricio Rosado and Rafaella Pinto from Brazil. Rosado, who owns a construction company, and Pinto, a law student, were looking for clothes, handbags, perfumes and watches. They were finding bargains compared with what they would spend back in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>"The prices are very, very different here," said Rosado, "much better."</p>

<p>A group of four former high school classmates from the Shanghai American School, in town for a reunion, were in high spirits as they waited for the doors to open. They were more into the shopping than people watching.</p>

<p>"We're on a mission to buy clothes," said one, Eilidth Lindsay-Sinclair, who's now a student at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Stephanie Springer and her brother Zachary were a rare find in this crowd -- area residents. They live in Port Jervis, N.Y., about an hour and a half away. Stephanie, who's an accountant, said she planned to buy some clothes for herself and gifts for family and friends.</p>

<p>"I'm doing OK, and I plan on spending about the same amount for gifts this year that I spent last," she said.</p>

<p>When the doors opened at the stroke of 12, the crowds quickly funneled into Macy's, with the streams of people heading quickly for the escalators.</p>

<p>The shoppers were orderly but they looked very determined as they hit the sales floors en masse.Â </p>
