<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Heading out for some shopping on Friday morning? You'll have some company.</p>

<p>Some 23% of Americans say they plan to go shopping on Black Friday, up from prior years, according to a CNN/ORC International poll.</p>

<p>The increased turnout could provide a much-needed boost to retailers looking to jumpstart sales in an otherwise weak economy. Only 37% say they plan to spend less on gifts this year than last year, compared to roughly half in 2009.</p>

<p>The figures are in line with a positive trend in retail sales in recent months. Retail sales went up 0.5% in October after increasing 1.1% in September, according to the Commerce Department.</p>

<p>The National Retail Federation has increased its estimate for the total number of shoppers over Black Friday weekend by 10% this year. Last year's turnout was 212 million.</p>

<p>The tough economic times will still take a toll on holiday shoppers, however. Nearly half say that current economic conditions will make this holiday more stressful than in previous years, including 56% of Americans who make less than $50,000 a year.</p>

<p>About 85% rated economic conditions in the country today as poor, including 51% who described them as "very poor."</p>

<p>The poll was based on interviews with 1,019 adult Americans conducted between November 18 and 20, with a sampling error of plus or minus 3%. The question about whether the holidays will be more stressful this year had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5%.Â </p>
