<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- I'm 57 and hoping to retire at 68, but I'm behind on my retirement savings. Should I invest as if I were younger and shift more into stocks to help increase my 401(k)? -- Jeff Branstrator, Greensboro, N.C.</p>

<p>At first glance, your strategy of loading up on equities to quickly bulk up your 401(k) and retire on schedule sounds smart. After all, stocks usually generate the highest returns.</p>

<p>Problem is, stocks' impressive long-term gains are sometimes interrupted by decade-long stretches when they languish. Far from churning out their historical 10% annualized gains since 1926, stocks lost 10% from the beginning of 2000 through the end of 2009.</p>

<p>Worse yet, equities periodically go into gut-wrenching nosedives, like the 50%-plus plunge from 2007 to 2009. Hit a patch like that as you near retirement, and a stock-heavy portfolio may work more like an anchor than a life preserver.</p>

<p>Even if you're fortunate enough to skirt a market stall or a hammering, shifting to a more aggressive allocation may not be the panacea you think. Saving more and postponing your retirement by a few years if you can -- many workers retire earlier than expected -- are safer and more effective than any portfolio moves you can make.</p>

<p>To illustrate, take the case of a hypothetical retirement saver who's also 57 and has $400,000 saved. While that nest egg seems sizable and far exceeds what many have, it falls short of widely used benchmarks for his age.</p>

<p>As you can see from the graphic, funneling more dollars into his 401(k) every pay period nudges up his chances of reaching his retirement goal -- but only marginally so. That's largely because retirement is near. Starting to salt away more, say, in his early fifties would have had a bigger impact.</p>

<p>Getting aggressive with his portfolio helps too but carries more uncertainty and the risk of a lower income if a bear market strikes again. The extra savings option is a better move, but neither shift ensures a secure retirement at age 65.</p>

<p>What really helps is what you're already planning to do: working longer. This strategy has a two-pronged effect: More time on the job means more years of 401(k) contributions and investment re-turns; plus working three years longer increases the Social Security benefit by 25% or so.</p>

<p>So rather than going pedal-to-the-metal with your 401(k) investments, I recommend that you put 60% of your portfolio in a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks and the rest in bonds -- a reasonable mix at your age. Then hike your savings rate, and stick with your plan to work longer.</p>
