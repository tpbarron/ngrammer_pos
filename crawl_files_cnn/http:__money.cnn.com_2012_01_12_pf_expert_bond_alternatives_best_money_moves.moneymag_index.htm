<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Our 401(k) and Roth investments are in stock index funds and commodities. We own no bonds. With a pension and Social Security, can we keep forgoing bonds? -- D.F., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Because your Social Security and traditional pension will churn out a steady income that's similar to the interest payment on a bond, you could theoretically go 100% stocks.</p>

<p>Whether you should depends on how you answer two questions.</p>

<p>The first is how much of your retirement expenses will be covered by Social Security and your pension. You can get the answer by consulting a budgeting worksheet, such as the interactive one that's part of Fidelity's Retirement Income Planner tool.</p>

<p>If it's all or nearly all and you're not depending on your investments for income, you can skip bonds, in theory. "Even if you ran into a string of 2008-size losses," says Morningstar global chief investment officer Tom Idzorek, "you would still have enough income to maintain your living standard."</p>

<p>If you're fortunate enough to find yourself in that position, you still have to deal with this second question: How much are you willing to see your retirement savings sink?</p>

<p>Conditions in the stock market can get ugly fast.</p>

<p>This past decade began with a 49% price drop and ended with a 57% one. So even with what Idzorek refers to as the "capacity" to bear the risk of an all-stock portfolio, you have to decide whether you have the tolerance: Could you sleep at night knowing that you could lose half of your savings?</p>

<p>Assuming the answer is no, you need to own bonds too.</p>

<p>Of course, very few retirees are lucky enough to cover all their expenses with a pension and Social Security. When you depend on your portfolio to provide any part of your income, you need to settle on a stock and bond mix that safely provides a sufficient payout.</p>

<p>As you can see in the graphic, a retiree who expects half his income to come from a pension and Social Security can go with a stock-heavy portfolio. But the more you devote to stocks, the greater the hit you'll take when the market tanks. And no pension will change that.</p>

<p>Adding more bonds won't hurt the chances your money will last -- and could help you sleep better.Â </p>
