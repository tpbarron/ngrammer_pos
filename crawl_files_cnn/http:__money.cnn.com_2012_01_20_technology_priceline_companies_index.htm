<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It's game over for William Shatner's "Priceline Negotiator." He will be killed in a fiery bus crash in a commercial set to air on Monday.</p>

<p>But it takes more than that to kill off Capt. Kirk. The online company says its ties with the actor aren't necessarily over.</p>

<p>"We only killed off the negotiator," company spokesman Brian Ek said Friday. "William Shatner is still under contract."</p>

<p>Shatner told CNNMoney he's also in the dark about Priceline's (PCLN) plans.</p>

<p>"They're leaving me on the same cliffhanger you're on," he said. "They're careful to mention that I still have a contract." He said there is about a year left on his current deal.</p>

<p>Ek said Priceline decided to have Shatner's character make such a spectacular departure as a way of drawing more attention to the company's published-price offering, which is much less well known than its name-your-own-price service.</p>

<p>Shatner's 14-year run with Priceline is one of the more enduring celebrity spokesman relationships in Madison Avenue history.</p>

<p>"He's not at the top, but he's close to the top," said Ek, who pointed to Michael Jordan's time with Hanes (HBI) and Nike (NKE, Fortune 500), and Bill Cosby's long-running campaign for Kraft's (KFT, Fortune 500) Jello as among the few relationships that lasted longer.</p>

<p>Shatner said he understood when Priceline informed him of plans to kill off his character.</p>

<p>"All advertising is an attempt to bring attention to their product," he said. "I know that's the case. It's a matter of good business."</p>

<p>And he said he's busy even without doing additional spots. The 80-year old actor, best known for his Captain Kirk character in Star Trek, opens a one-man biographical show on Broadway next month.</p>

<p>Shatner said he's proud of his association with Priceline, and the way the company bounced back from its troubles after the bursting of the Internet bubble ten years ago.</p>

<p>Company filings said that he had been given warrants for 65,000 shares of the stock. Those shares were worth about $10.7 million soon after the company's initial public offering, but Shatner said lock-up rules prevented him from selling at that point.</p>

<p>He picked the wrong moment to unload them. Shatner said he sold all those shares around the time that the stock bottomed out in value a few years later, and that he never bought additional shares.</p>

<p>Even with a reverse 1-for-6 split that the company implemented in 2003, that stake would be worth about $5.6 million today if he had held onto the shares.Â </p>
