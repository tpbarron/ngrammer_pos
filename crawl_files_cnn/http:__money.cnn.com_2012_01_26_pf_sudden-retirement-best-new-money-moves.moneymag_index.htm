<p>Roxann & Ed Parker, 59 and 63, O'Fallon, Mo. Retired.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- We spoke to five families who face challenges that could keep them from meeting their financial goals. With a few tweaks to their game plan, they can get back on course. Here, the Parkers' story -- and the recommended financial fixes.</p>

<p>Ed Parker never planned on retiring early. But in 2009, at age 61, he was laid off from his job as a manager at a Caterpillar dealership and realized he was ready to end full-time work. His wife, Roxann, had retired a decade earlier from her job at a department store, and travel plans beckoned.</p>

<p>To stay busy, Ed volunteered at a local hospital and was offered a part-time job, which gives him an income of $900 a month. The Parkers live in an inexpensive area, and pay only $265 a month for their mortgage. That habit, plus Ed's income, his severance package, and taking Social Security at 62, meant that the couple haven't had to tap their retirement savings.</p>

<p>Now that the severance package is finished, financial worries are creeping in. They aren't sure how much they can afford to withdraw from their savings each year ($455,000 in two traditional IRAs and $47,000 in a brokerage account), when Roxann should take Social Security and whether they can still afford luxuries like a trip to the West Indies. "We just want to make sure we're doing the right thing," says Ed.</p>

<p>Their finances</p>

<p>The problem</p>

<p>Though the Parkers live simply, not having a coherent plan for making withdrawals risks over-spending. "It's important to get this right now," says financial planner Michele Clark of Chesterfield, Mo., "because the first few years of withdrawals have the biggest impact on the portfolio."</p>

<p>The good news is that their 60%-stock/40%-bond mix is right on target, but too big a chunk in intermediate-term bonds leaves them vulnerable to a big drop if interest rates rise.</p>

<p>The advice</p>

<p>Create a spending plan. At Clark's request, the Parkers came up with a detailed budget for 2012: $45,200 for living expenses. Subtracting Ed's post-tax Social Security payment ($19,143) and salary ($10,800) means they will need to withdraw $15,252 from investment accounts.</p>

<p>That's less than 3% of their portfolio -- well under the 4% most planners suggest -- but other expenses are on the horizon: They would like to take that trip to the West Indies soon ($5,000) and within four years will need a new car and camper trailer.</p>

<p>Tap taxable accounts first. Cash out the brokerage account and let the IRAs continue to grow tax-deferred, says Clark. The Parkers should keep the next year's withdrawals in cash and the funds for the following two years in one- and two-year CDs.</p>

<p>They can fund the West Indies trip by dipping into their $13,500 cash savings, since their expenses are low. "That's a relief," says Ed. "The trip seemed like a huge splurge."</p>

<p>Diversify the bonds. The Parkers' fixed-income allocation (38%) was nearly all in intermediate-term bonds. Cutting that to 20%, adding 15% of short-term bonds, and bumping up cash holdings from 3% to 5% should reduce volatility.</p>

<p>Take Social Security early. The rule of thumb is to delay taking Social Security as long as possible, but with more than $30,000 in expenses coming up for a new car and camper, Roxann should take it when she qualifies, says Clark. Otherwise, they would start depleting their retirement accounts too soon.</p>

<p>Assuming they follow that plan, the Parkers have a greater than 80% chance that their funds will last them into their early nineties, says Clark. Sounds good, says Ed: "Now we don't have to worry anymore."</p>
