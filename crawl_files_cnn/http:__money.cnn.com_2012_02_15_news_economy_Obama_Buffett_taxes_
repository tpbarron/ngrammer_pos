<p>Obama's proposed "principle" to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes is intended for tax reform. But some Senate Democrats want to enact it sooner.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The Buffett Rule makes for great stump speeches in an election year. But as tax policy it leaves much to be desired.</p>

<p>First proposed by President Obama last year, it's intended to ensure that people making more than $1 million a year pay a higher share of their income in taxes than middle class households.</p>

<p>The president has even specified that he wants the rich to pay at least 30% of their income in taxes.</p>

<p>But the administration, in putting forth Obama's budget this week, made clear that they are not pushing to implement the Buffett Rule now. Rather, it's a guiding principle for when -- if -- Congress takes up tax reform.</p>

<p>But several Senate Democrats don't want to wait. They introduced a bill earlier this month that seeks to apply the Buffett Rule to today's tax code "as an interim step [to tax reform] that can be done quickly," according to the legislation.</p>

<p>The "Paying a Fair Share Act" would apply to anyone whose adjustable gross income exceeds $1 million. Those who itemize their deductions would get a credit equal to the value of their charitable contribution deductions, so as not to discourage charitable giving.</p>

<p>To measure whether a millionaire is paying at least 30% of his income in taxes, the bill would take into account what the individual paid in federal income and payroll taxes plus the new 3.8% Medicare surtax that goes into effect in 2013.</p>

<p>Under the parameters set by the bill, 217,000 millionaire households in 2015 would end up owing an average of $190,000 more in taxes than they pay today, assuming no behavioral changes, the Tax Policy Center estimates. That could boost revenue by as much as $41 billion that year.</p>

<p>But here's the thing: Even without a Buffett Rule in place in 2015, nearly all millionaires would already be paying more in taxes as a percentage of their income than those in the middle class, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, noted in a TaxVox blog post.</p>

<p>He estimates that middle-income households on average would pay 15% of their income in taxes, using the bill's parameters, while 99% of millionaires would pay more than that. And that vast majority of that 99% would pay an effective tax rate of 20% or higher.</p>

<p>Moreover, by creating a 30% threshold that the wealthy must meet, the Buffett Rule means high-income households would need to calculate their taxes three times -- once under the regular code, once under the Alternative Minimum Tax and once under the Buffett rule.</p>

<p>"The proposed legislation would certainly raise taxes on a lot of high-income taxpayers. But the price would be an even more complicated tax code. There are better ways to raise taxes on the rich," Williams noted.</p>

<p>In his budget, Obama does call for the Buffett Rule to replace the Alternative Minimum Tax entirely. That would be simpler than adding it on top of the AMT.</p>

<p>But it almost certainly would create a new revenue problem. That's because the AMT is projected to raise a ton of revenue -- roughly $2 trillion over 10 years, give or take a few billion. So until someone figures out how to clone rich taxpayers, it's unlikely the revenue generated by the Buffett Rule could match it.</p>

<p>Moreover, Williams noted, if tax reform is done right there shouldn't be a need for a Buffett Rule, an AMT or any other accessory to the tax code.</p>

<p>The only reason policymakers call for such measures is when they don't like the outcomes of the system they've got. Tax reform is their chance to design a better system. And if one goal is to tax the rich more, they can do that in a simpler, more effective way than the Buffett Rule.Â </p>
