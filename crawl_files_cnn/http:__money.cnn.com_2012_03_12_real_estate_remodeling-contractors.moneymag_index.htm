<p>When remodeling, create a financial plan upfront and contractors can tailor proposals to fit what you can afford.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- Budgeting for a large remodeling project presents a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: You won't have a feel for the cost until you get bids from contractors.</p>

<p>But unless you give pros a ballpark figure from the start, they'll have to guess at what to include in their bids -- and they'll come back to you with a huge range of prices for very different plans.</p>

<p>"A faucet can cost $200 to $900, a window can be $400 to $1,200," says Madison contractor Mike Gasch. "I need to know where to aim."</p>

<p>To solve this conundrum, do some calculations first.</p>

<p>1. Start with average costs |</p>

<p>When insurance companies need to pinpoint construction costs, they multiply the length by the width of the space and then multiply that by the project's typical cost per square foot.</p>

<p>Albert Paxton, an estimator who provides such data to claims adjusters and contractors, pegs average per-square-foot costs of remodeling jobs at this:</p>

<p>2. Tweak to fit the scope</p>

<p>These numbers are for gut remodels, meaning the room is demolished right down to the framing and rebuilt.</p>

<p>With a less involved project -- in the kitchen, say, you might be refacing the cabinets and replacing the countertops and appliances instead of tearing out everything -- cut your number by about 30%, says Paxton.</p>

<p>For a cosmetic update, as in fresh paint on the cabinets plus new lighting and hardware, reduce it by about 60%.</p>

<p>3. Adjust for your location</p>

<p>A plumber working in Manhattan might charge twice the hourly rate of one in Statesboro, Ga.</p>

<p>Same goes for everyone from laborers to architects. In a metro area along the Northeast or Pacific seaboards, add 30% to 40% (use your judgment about your market). In a rural area, especially in the South or Midwest, drop it by 15% to 20%.</p>

<p>4. Modify for style</p>

<p>These figures assume you're buying mid-range fixtures and finishes. If you're going upscale, as in granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances, or stone bathroom tiles and a separate soaking tub and walk-in shower, raise your number by 30% to 40%, depending on how elaborate you're getting. For an economy job, say at a rental property, cut it by 25%.</p>

<p>Make your number fit your finances by adjusting items 2 and 4, then be upfront about your bottom line with contractors who look at the job.</p>

<p>"If I have a good feel for your budget," says Cambridge, Mass., contractor Charlie Allen, "I can deliver maximum value within your financing."</p>
