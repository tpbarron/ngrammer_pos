<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- I'm in my mid 60s and I'm rolling $1.5 million into an IRA. I'd like to create a portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds using low-fee ETFs and mutual funds. Is this a good plan -- and which funds and ETFs would you suggest? -- Ollie F.</p>

<p>Your plan is spot on.</p>

<p>The real beauty of it is your focus on keeping investment expenses down, a strategy that has the potential to boost returns by limiting the portion of the your investment's gain siphoned off by the fund company.</p>

<p>Most people understand that lower costs and higher returns can help them amass more savings during a career, but I'm not sure people appreciate the benefit of that combination in retirement -- it can substantially reduce the danger of running through your savings too soon.</p>

<p>Let's say you plan to withdraw an initial 4%, or $60,000, from your $1.5 million at age 65 and then increase that amount for inflation each year. And let's further assume that your annual expenses run 1.5% a year, a ballpark figure for people who invest in mutual funds and the like.</p>

<p>Reducing your investing costs by half a percentage point to 1% a year can lower your probability of running through your savings before age 95 by roughly 25%.</p>

<p>Reduce your yearly investing expenses a full percentage point to 0.5% -- which is doable if you stick to ETFs and index funds with the lowest expense ratios -- and your chances of running through your dough within 30 years may decline almost by half.</p>

<p>There's no guarantee that you'll be able to duplicate these results exactly. That's because even though lower-cost investments do generally lead to higher returns, you can't be certain of getting a full percentage point in extra gain for each percentage-point reduction in expenses. So your results will depend, among other things, on the return your investments earn net of fees.</p>

<p>But to whatever extent lower expenses boosts your returns, your savings are likely to last longer at any given withdrawal rate. And that's a big deal in retirement, when the last thing you want to do is run out of money before you run out of time.</p>

<p>So where can you find ETFs and funds that will allow you to reap the benefits of low expenses?</p>

<p>Just go to our MONEY 70 list of recommended funds. There, you'll find plenty of funds and ETFs that have expenses that are well-below their category averages.</p>

<p>If you really want to play the skinflint, stick to the ETFs and index funds on the list that follow broad stock- and bond-market benchmarks, many of which have total annual expenses of 0.2% or less. And since research shows that people can become confused and overwhelmed when faced with a blizzard of choices, I also recommend that you keep your portfolio simple.</p>

<p>If you're up for a real no-muss-no-fuss approach, you can create a 60% stocks-40% bonds portfolio with just two investments: a total stock market ETF (VTI) or index fund (VTSMX), plus a total bond market ETF (BND) or index fund (VBMFX). That combo alone will give you a broadly diversified portfolio of U.S. stocks of all sizes, as well as high-quality corporate and government taxable U.S. bonds.</p>

<p>If you want to expand your stock holdings beyond the U.S., you can devote 10% to 20% of the equity portion of your portfolio to a total international stock ETF (VEU) or index fund (VGTSX), which would add shares of both foreign developed and emerging markets to your holdings.</p>

<p>You can diversify even more broadly if you wish, picking a real estate, TIPS or commodities fund or ETF. But before you start loading up on the ever-expanding smorgasbord of alternative investments pitched by investment firms today, be aware that more funds may not translate into better performance. In fact, a complicated and unwieldy portfolio may lead to subpar results.</p>

<p>As you get older, you may want to consider scaling back your stock holdings to prevent a market crash from decimating your nest egg late in life. Here's how different firms make the transition from mostly stocks to mostly bonds in their target-date retirement funds.</p>

<p>But whatever blend of stocks and bonds you start with and move to over time, you'll increase your chance of boosting your returns -- as well as the longevity of your nest egg -- by choosing ETFs and funds that siphon off as few of your investment dollars as possible along the way.</p>
