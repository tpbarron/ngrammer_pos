<p>How should you divide up your investments from the age of 55 and older? Try this model portfolio.</p>

<p>(MONEY magazine) -- Welcome to the homestretch! You still need momentum, but with retirement in sight, your mix of stocks and bonds should begin to balance out.</p>

<p>Keep only 50% to 60% in equities -- on the higher end if you have a pension or plan to work past 65, suggests Scott Thoma of Edward Jones. That way you'll get growth from stocks but just as much stability from bonds.</p>

<p>As you enter retirement, you can gradually tip the balance toward the safer side of your portfolio.</p>

<p>Here is the third of three model portfolios -- this one will carry you from the age of 55 and up -- and suggestions for investments, including low-cost funds from the MONEY 70. You can also check out our investing tips for ages 35 to 44 and 45 to 54.</p>

<p>Want to exercise more muscle? Choose the "boost" option, which involves taking a bit more risk for the chance at more return.</p>

<p>Even without this extra pop, though, the strong core you'll find here will help you reach retirement a winner.</p>

<p>You continue to cut from your equity side and use some of the money to add to U.S. bonds (which jump from 18% to 25% of your portfolio) and foreign bonds (which bump up only slightly, from 4% to 5%). The remaining dough goes into these categories: Government securities: Put 5% into TIPS. Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities (VIPSX): Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities help offset increases in the price of goods -- which can be a killer once you enter retirement. Sounds good, right? Just one problem: Yields on TIPS have fallen to historic lows. That means that if you buy in now, a rise in rates could lead to temporary losses. A better move: Build up the position gradually through this Vanguard fund, which invests heavily in TIPS of shorter maturities. If yields turn around, the funds can trade up.</p>

<p>Cash: 2%. Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index (VBISX): In your fifties, you want to start moving a small portion (2%) of your portfolio to cash, advises Dallas financial planner John Kvale. That way, as you near retirement, a portion of your savings is safe from stock or bond swings -- which should help keep you from going into panic mode. With money-market funds paying just 0.03% per year right now, however, you might want to store the cash in a short-term bond fund like this one from Vanguard. It's a little bit riskier than a cash account but yields a lot more (1.74%). Increase your stash to a year of expenses just before quitting work.</p>

<p>With retirement on the horizon, now is not the time for big risks. However, you could peel from your large-caps and put 10% in dividend-paying stocks, the income from which can buoy your portfolio. Today you can easily find blue chips paying more than 2% -- the yield on a 10-year Treasury -- with potential for increases.</p>

<p>Dividends aren't guaranteed, though, so stick to quality investments, such as:</p>

<p>Dividend stocks: 10%. Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500): The stock yields 2.5%, and the tech giant spends only 20% of its cash on the dividend, leaving room to grow the payout. Also, shares are priced at 11 times expected earnings (the S&P average is 13). Abbott Laboratories (ABT, Fortune 500): Pharma firm Abbott yields 3.6%, using under half its cash for the dividend, says Mark Freeman, chief investment officer at Westwood. Plus, the stock trades at just 11 times expected earnings.</p>

<p>Dividend ETF. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG): This doesn't have the biggest yield (2%), but it buys only companies that have consistently raised dividends and can sustain the payout.</p>
