<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Congress has invented a new extreme sport: Skating on the edge of a $7 trillion fiscal cliff.</p>

<p>That's the magnitude of tax increases and spending cuts that will start to hit the economy on Jan. 1, 2013, unless Congress acts.</p>

<p>And how Congress navigates that fiscal cliff will affect economic growth, Americans' wallets and the country's fiscal outlook. (Fiscal cliff: What should Congress do?)</p>

<p>"There is about $7 trillion there that ... could be taken out of the economy in a really stupid way that would likely push us into a recession immediately," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p>

<p>Indeed, economist Mark Zandi estimates that inaction by Congress could chop 3 percentage points off inflation-adjusted economic growth in 2013. In that scenario, he estimates the economy would stop growing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, simply extending all the expiring tax policies and canceling the spending cuts could add more than $7 trillion to the country's debt over 10 years. While that would boost growth in 2013, it would hurt the economy by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>Of course, anyone with a modicum of common sense would prefer a more finessed approach. "We have to come up with a compromise to thread this needle," said MacGuineas, who appeared at a recent conference.</p>

<p>But few observers think that will happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>Instead, most believe that lawmakers will postpone taking up the issue until after the Nov. 6 elections, giving themselves less than eight weeks to address what may be the largest single package of fiscal issues they've ever tackled.</p>

<p>How did it come to this?</p>

<p>Bush tax cuts and AMT fix: In 2001, 2003 and 2006, Congress passed a series of tax measures known as the Bush tax cuts. They reduced income and investment tax rates; shrank the estate tax bite; and expanded a number of breaks for low- and middle-income families.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Congress regularly extended the temporary "patch" to the Alternative Minimum Tax so that more than 20 million families wouldn't get trapped by the so-called wealth tax.</p>

<p>If the Bush tax cuts and AMT patch were allowed to expire as scheduled, households would be hit with an average tax increase of $3,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates. The lowest 20% of households with a tax increase would pay $512 more on average, while the top rung would pay $12,819 more.</p>

<p>If both policies are extended, most people wouldn't notice any changes in the near-term. But the federal budget would take a long-term hit if lawmakers didn't enact offsetting policies to pay for the extensions, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cost $5.35 trillion over 10 years, including debt service.</p>

<p>If the measures expire, the country's medium-term debt problem could be greatly reduced. But it would be a blunt strategy.</p>

<p>Far better would be "to raise revenue by simplifying and cleaning out tax breaks ... rather than adding higher rates on a top of a code that is in many ways broken," a report from MacGuineas' CRFB said.</p>

<p>Big spending cuts: As part of the debt ceiling deal Congress struck last summer, nearly $1 trillion in spending cuts over nine years are set to take effect starting next year.</p>

<p>In addition to cutting defense by 10%, the so-called sequester will also cut about 8% from non-defense discretionary programs. Appropriators haven't decided how much to cut specific programs. But individuals are bound to be affected, since non-defense spending involves everything from education to law enforcement to housing assistance and national parks.</p>

<p>Deficits would be reduced by $1.2 trillion over 10 years, including debt service, if the cuts -- or a replacement Congress agrees on -- take effect as scheduled.</p>

<p>Doc fix: Reimbursements to Medicare physicians will be cut by close to 30% next year unless lawmakers prevent it. They've done so for years under the so-called doc fix and are likely to do so again.</p>

<p>The cost of the doc fix is roughly $30 billion a year.</p>

<p>Tax extenders: Congress regularly extends more than 50 "temporary" tax breaks for businesses and individuals.</p>

<p>The so-called extenders include one that lets businesses accelerate their depreciation for equipment purchases and another that gives individuals the option to deduct state sales taxes on their federal returns.</p>

<p>The economic value of keeping all the extenders is debatable. Tax experts argue that many should be ditched -- and those that are kept should be made permanent.</p>

<p>Temporarily extending them can cost anywhere from $25 billion to $35 billion a year.</p>

<p>Payroll tax cut: The usual Social Security tax rate paid by workers is 6.2% on the first $110,100 in wages (up from $106,800 last year). But for the past two years it's been 4.2%.</p>

<p>Once the payroll tax holiday expires, workers making $50,000 will again have to pay an additional $1,000 into the system next year -- or about $83 a month. Those making $100,000 would pay double that.</p>

<p>The cost of extending the payroll tax cut approaches $115 billion a year.</p>

<p>While it seems unlikely that lawmakers would extend it again, if they do, they will add to what Uncle Sam owes Social Security.</p>

<p>Why? Because Congress has decided that the Social Security trust fund shouldn't take the hit from the payroll tax cut; rather, general revenue should be used to compensate the fund.</p>

<p>Unemployment benefits: Congress for the past few years has authorized special help for the jobless -- a higher maximum number of weeks that the unemployed can collect benefits. The latest extension expires at the end of the year.</p>

<p>It's not clear if lawmakers will extend the policy. Doing so would cost roughly $44 billion.Â </p>
