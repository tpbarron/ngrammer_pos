<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- In a sign of strong demand from investors for shares in its upcoming initial public offering, Facebook is raising the target price range for its stock.</p>

<p>Facebook now expects to price its shares at $34 to $38 each, up from the $28 to $35 range it set earlier this month, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission early Tuesday.</p>

<p>Facebook executives and the company's IPO underwriters have spent the past two weeks on the road meeting with potential investors and measuring the demand for the company's stock.</p>

<p>The investor response has been "nothing short of pandemonium," one source familiar with the discussions told CNNMoney.</p>

<p>If Facebook (FB) prices at the high end of its new proposed range, the company's valuation would hover around $81.2 billion on the day of its IPO.</p>

<p>Many Facebook employees and executives, including founder Mark Zuckerberg, hold unexercised stock options. The company itself is also holding some shares for future employee equity grants.</p>

<p>If all of those shares were exercised, Facebook's outstanding share count would rise to around 2.8 billion, pushing its valuation closer to $106.4 billion.</p>

<p>Facebook's proposed IPO price range isn't binding, and it could rise further if demand is heavy. The company expects to set its final price Thursday evening.</p>

<p>The final price is the one at which Facebook's underwriters will sell shares to their clients, which typically include large institutional investors, mutual funds and hedge funds.</p>

<p>Retail investors will get access to Facebook shares the next morning, when the stock begins publicly trading on the Nasdaq exchange. That is currently on track to happen Friday.</p>
