<p>The Senate confirmed Jerome Powell (left) and Jeremy Stein to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It's about time.</p>

<p>For the first time in six years, the Federal Reserve Board will soon have a full roster.</p>

<p>The Senate confirmed two of President Barack Obama's nominees to the central bank Thursday. Jerome Powell, 59, a lawyer and former investment banker, and economist Jeremy Stein, 51, are being named Fed governors.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board in Washington is supposed to be headed by seven voting members, but the last time all of those seats were filled was in April 2006.</p>

<p>The seven members of the Board of Governors are the central bank's highest ranking officials. Appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, they serve 14-year terms, but many resign before completing a full stint.</p>

<p>Both Presidents George W. Bush and Obama have struggled to push their nominees through the Senate. Obama's previous nominee, Nobel prize-winning economist Peter Diamond, withdrew his nomination last June, citing opposition from Senate Republicans.</p>

<p>The newly approved Powell and Stein garnered more bipartisan support, because they represent both sides of the aisle. Powell is a Republican and has donated to presidential candidates John McCain in 2008 and most recently Mitt Romney. Stein donated to Obama's campaign in 2008.</p>

<p>"I'm here today not only to say that I admire the nominees," said Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee. "I want to acknowledge the fact that the President chose to break the stalemate by nominating Mr. Powell, a Republican, as well as a Democrat."</p>

<p>Prior to the vote, Republicans also noted their discontent with the Federal Reserve's recent actions.</p>

<p>The Fed has kept interest rates at historic lows since 2008 and enacted two rounds of asset purchases in an effort to help the economy recover from the recession.</p>

<p>Republicans fear those efforts will eventually lead to a sudden rise in inflation. That said, many were willing to vote in favor of the nominees anyway.</p>

<p>"They're not ideal from my perspective, but they are qualified," said Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee.</p>

<p>Both Powell and Stein hold degrees from Princeton and have served briefly with the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Powell has recently been working as a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. He served as Undersecretary of the Treasury for Finance under President George H.W. Bush.</p>

<p>An economics professor at Harvard, Stein served as an adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and worked for the National Economic Council. He holds a bachelor's degree from Princeton and a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Â </p>
