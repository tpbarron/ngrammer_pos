<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Spain found strong demand for its debt in a successful auction Thursday, two days after its treasury minister warned that the country was in danger of being shut out of markets for the cash it needs to operate.</p>

<p>Demand was more than three times the €611 million worth of 10-year bonds that Spain offered, up from a bid-to-offer ratio of 2.42 in April. But the interest rate Spain had to pay to sell the debt rose to 6.044% from 5.743% in April.</p>

<p>The yield for Spain's 10-year debt edged slightly lower to 6.13% in trading following the auction.</p>

<p>Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro told Spanish radio station Onda Cero Tuesday that "the risk premium says that as a state we have a problem in accessing markets, when we need to refinance our debt."</p>

<p>He called for more help from other European governments to help support Spanish banks, saying the country couldn't solve its sovereign debt problems on its own.</p>

<p>A fixed income analyst said Thursday's results show that door hasn't shut yet on Spain.</p>

<p>"I think it's definitely positive in that they were able to get the money, albeit at elevated levels," said Brian Barry, a fixed income analyst for Investec in London. "But there is still a great deal of uncertainty whether they'll continue to have market access."</p>

<p>In addition to the 10-year auction, Spain had improved demand in auctions of 2-year and 4-year bonds, although the yields for those maturities rose as well.</p>

<p>Problems with Spain's banking system and its sovereign debt have become the central concern for investors and economists in recent weeks.</p>

<p>While there are still uncertainties about whether Greece will be forced to drop the euro following its upcoming parliamentary elections on June 17, the possibility of Spain needing help is a more pressing concern due to the size of the economy -- the fourth largest in the eurozone.</p>

<p>The fear is that Spain will need to be bailed out if it cannot come up with a way to recapitalize the banking sector, which could cost up to €100 billion by some estimates. But it remains to be seen if Germany will back a plan to allow bailout funds to be pumped directly to banks.</p>

<p>The success of the Spanish auction helped lift European stocks as well as U.S. stock futures in early trading Thursday. </p>
