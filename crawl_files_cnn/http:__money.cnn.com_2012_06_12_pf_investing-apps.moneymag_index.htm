<p>Financial news isn't hard to find on your phone, but this app gives you lots of it in an easy-to-read format: coverage from our partner CNNMoney, as well as MarketWatch, Reuters, and TheStreet.com.

<p>Like most brokerage apps, TDAmeritrade's lets you feverishly follow markets and buy and sell fast. The watch list options are notably extensive.

With the Snapstock function (phone only), you can take a picture of a bar code and look up the public company behind the product.</p>

<p>WikInvest Portfolio Manager</p>

<p>Want to dabble in the markets without losing your shirt? Make it a game. Literally.
