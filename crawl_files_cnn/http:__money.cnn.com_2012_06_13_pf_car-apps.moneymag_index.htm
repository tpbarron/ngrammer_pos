<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- In the market for a new set of wheels? Or want to save on gas? Are you doing the best to keep down the costs of your car repairs?</p>

<p>These 5 best money car apps will get you there.</p>

<p>Essential app: Gas Buddy</p>

<p>Great for: Getting a better price on gas</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>Available for: Android, iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Phone 7</p>

<p>With gas circling $4 a gallon, you may be especially motivated to shave off a few pennies. Use GasBuddy to find nearby stations with the lowest prices, says Wayne Cunningham of CNET.com's car tech blog (or at least the lowest price provided by GasBuddy's community of members).</p>

<p>KBB.com</p>

<p>Great for: Shopping for a used car</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>Available for: Android, iPhone, Windows Phone 7</p>

<p>For negotiating knowhow, take Kelley Blue Book's app with you to the lot. It whizzes you through a series of swipes -- year, make, model, features -- before spitting out a suggested value, which you can adjust based on the vehicle's mileage and condition, and type of seller.</p>

<p>Edmunds.com</p>

<p>Great for: Shopping for a new car</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>Available for: Android, iPhone, iPad</p>

<p>Pull up photos, reviews, and data to research a car -- then see a map with dealerships near you that have the model you want in stock. When you're face-to-face with a smooth-talking car salesman, use Edmunds' proprietary True Market Value number -- the average selling price for that model in your area -- for ammunition.</p>

<p>RepairPal</p>

<p>Great for: Helping you keep your car in top shape</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>Available for: Android, iPhone</p>

<p>Record your car's repair history and get a checklist of maintenance you need to schedule. To help judge any shop's estimate, look up a local price range for more than 100 types of repairs. In trouble? Connect to the roadside assistance network (you'll pay for just service you use).</p>

<p>iWrecked</p>

<p>Great for: Coping with a car accident</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>Available for: Android, iPhone</p>

<p>Indispensable after an accident, especially if you're shaken up. The app guides you through the details you need to take note of, from the time and place to the other driver's insurance info. Shoot pictures of the damage with your phone's camera. Then export an accident report as a PDF. Can't drive home? iWrecked suggests nearby taxi and towing services.</p>
