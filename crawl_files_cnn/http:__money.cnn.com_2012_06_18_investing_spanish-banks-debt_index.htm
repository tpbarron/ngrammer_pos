<p>Spain's banking and debt problems have moved to the center of the European sovereign debt crisis.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- With Greece's election over, the concern of investors and economists has shifted to the larger Spanish banking and sovereign debt crisis.</p>

<p>The fourth largest economy in the eurozone, Spain has already asked for €100 billion ($125.8 billion) in assistance from the EU rescue fund to recapitalize its banks. Other European countries have voiced support for such a bailout in a effort to keep the problems at Spanish banks from spreading to other nations.</p>

<p>But the depth of the nation's crisis has raised doubts about whether €100 billion will be enough to recapitalize the banks. For example, the Bank of Spain, the nation's central bank, released data Monday showing that "doubtful" loans -- those that are more than 3 months overdue -- rose to €152.7 billion in April, equal to 8.7% of all the loans held by the nation's banks.</p>

<p>The volume of troubled bank loans has soared by nearly a third in the last year as Spain has fallen into a deep recession.</p>

<p>"I think people have problems accepting numbers on the bailout request," said Elisabeth Afseth, fixed income analyst for Investec in London. "The €100 billion may or may not be enough."</p>

<p>Banco Santander (SAN) and BBVA (BBVA), the two largest banks, both had shares plunge more than 4% in Madrid and 5% in New York trading. The Spanish banks helped take Spain's IBEX composite stock index down nearly 3%, on a day that saw London's FTSE (UKX) and the German Dax (DAX) close narrowly higher, and the Paris CAC (CAC40) lose less than 1%.</p>

<p>The yield on Spain's 10-year bond soared to a euro-era high of 7.16%, a level that not only raises the nation's borrowing costs but is widely seen as unsustainable. But experts say there's little to bring rates down in the near term.</p>

<p>"If you didn't want to buy Spanish debt before the bank bailout, I see no reason why you would want to do so after," said Afseth.</p>

<p>That's because the Spanish picture is gloomy. Spain has record high unemployment of 24.3%, and more than half of all of its young workers are without a job. Spanish housing prices, which shot up in the warm weather coastal communities during the real estate boom, have been cut in half by the crisis.</p>

<p>Spain's sovereign debt, which was just under 70% of its gross domestic product in 2011, is now expected to rise to between 95% or 110% of GDP by 2015, according to estimates from the credit rating agency Fitch last week.</p>

<p>With Spain's debt already rated at the lowest level above junk bond status, it's not clear that the bank bailout will be enough help for the country's troubled finances.</p>

<p>A separate bailout of Spain's government debts, on top of its bank bailout, could reach at least €300 billion to cover its current refinancing needs and the operating deficit in the next few years, said Investec's Afseth.</p>

<p>Bank and sovereign bailouts of Spain totaling €400 billion would wipe out most of the remaining €557 billion in the existing European bailout fund -- not including the €223 billion already committed to help Greece, Portugal and Ireland.</p>

<p>And that level of help is in some question, as more than €500 billion of the money committed to the rescue fund has yet to be contributed by the more prosperous member nations.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Institute of International Finance wrote a report to its members saying that the Spanish bank bailout by itself may deplete the bailout fund for all but the proposed rescue of a country the size of tiny Cyprus.</p>

<p>Which explains why Spain is now front and center among those worried about Europe and the world's financial system. </p>
