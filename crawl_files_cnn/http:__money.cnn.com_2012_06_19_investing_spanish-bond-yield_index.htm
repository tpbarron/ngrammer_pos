<p>Spanish bond yields are still trading at anxiety-inducing heights, and investors can't stop thinking about the possiblity of a bailout.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Spain's borrowing costs continued to rise Tuesday, with the yield on the 10-year bond hitting another record high above 7%.</p>

<p>Worries that Spain may need a bailout of its own is fueling investor anxiety.</p>

<p>The yield on the 10-year bond spiked to 7.27% early Tuesday -- its highest level since the euro debuted in 1999 -- according to Tradeweb, before easing slightly to 7.11%.</p>

<p>The 7% mark is the first warning sign that a country may be headed toward needing financial rescue.</p>

<p>"It looks inevitable that Spain is going to mirror the experience of Italy, Portugal [and] Greece, and is going to need a bailout sooner than later," said Nick Stamenkovic, fixed income strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>The rising borrowing costs came as Spain sold €2.4 billion worth of one-year bills at 5.2% and €639 million of 18-month bills at 5.35%. While the demand was strong, the yields were nearly twice as high as last month's auction.</p>

<p>Spain cannot afford to borrow at 7% for long, and analysts say the nation is effectively shut out of the market at these levels.</p>

<p>The rising rates signal investors' "total lack of confidence" in Spain's sovereign debt, especially considering the relatively short maturities of the bills, said Stamenkovic. "Inevitably, that means [Spain] will probably need a full scale bailout, in addition to the banking bailout, by autumn, if not earlier."</p>

<p>On June 7, credit rating agency Fitch downgraded the country's sovereign debt to the lowest grade above junk status.</p>

<p>Two days later, the Spanish government requested up to €100 billion from the European Union to recapitalize insolvent banks. But the rescue plan failed to ease concerns about the sustainability of Spain's public debt.</p>

<p>An audit of Spanish banks is due to be released Thursday -- the same day Spain plans to auction off longer-term bonds. But a more in-depth audit that was due at the end of July has been pushed to September</p>

<p>"We believe sustained high yields will eventually force Spain into taking a full-fledged bailout," wrote Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Marc Chandler, in a client note. "The market simply does not have this kind of patience."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, banking stocks Banco Santander (SAN) and BBVA (BBVA) both closed higher by about 4%.</p>

<p>European stocks rallied. London's FTSE (UKX), the DAX (DAX) in Frankfurt and the CAC 40 (CAC40) all ended about 1.7% higher. </p>
