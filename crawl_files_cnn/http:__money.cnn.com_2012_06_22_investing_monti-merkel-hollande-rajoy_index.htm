<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The leaders of the four biggest eurozone economies agreed Friday on a plan to boost economic growth in the troubled currency union.</p>

<p>At a meeting in Rome, the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Spain discussed their priorities for a key summit of European Union leaders next week.</p>

<p>Without going into detail, the leaders said they agreed on a set of growth-enhancing policies equal to about €125 billion, or 1% of eurozone gross domestic product.</p>

<p>"We are preparing a plan for economic integration on a long-term basis in Europe," said Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti at a press conference following the meeting.</p>

<p>Monti was flanked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Francois Hollande and Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy.</p>

<p>The meeting came ahead of the next European Council, which brings together the leaders of all 27 members of the European Union, on June 28-29.</p>

<p>On Friday, the leaders said they plan to outline their long-term vision for the euro currency and take steps to strengthen the monetary union with deeper economic and financial integration.</p>

<p>In particular, the leaders are expected to announce the formation of a banking union, which could include shared oversight and deposit insurance.</p>

<p>They are also considering an increase in the resources of the European Investment Bank. The goal is to boost growth and create jobs by investing in public works.</p>

<p>At the press conference, the leaders did not say anything specific about a controversial plan to use bailout funds to buy euro area government bonds.</p>

<p>Merkel has resisted the proposal, which is backed by Monti, Hollande and Rajoy.</p>

<p>Germany is generally opposed to the idea of using eurozone funds to subsidize government debt, since doing so could make it easier for policymakers to delay unpopular economic reforms.</p>

<p>However, borrowing costs for large euro area economies, including Italy and Spain, have been rising as investors fear those nations may need to be bailed out.</p>

<p>The leaders did express support for a tax on financial transactions, a move championed by Hollande.</p>

<p>Hollande reiterated that Eurobonds, which would combine the debts of euro area governments, are one of many "useful instruments" under consideration.</p>

<p>Rajoy seemed to support using funds from the European Financial Stability Facility to recapitalize Spanish banks.</p>

<p>Spain will officially request loans from the euro area bailout fund to shore up insolvent banks on Monday. Final terms and conditions of the loans still need be finalized.</p>

<p>By March, Rajoy said the leaders will have in place "all the mechanisms to reach financial stability in Europe."  </p>
