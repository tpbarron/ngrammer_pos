<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Greek finance minister Vassilis Rapanos has resigned for health reasons, the Greek government said Monday.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Antonis Samaras accepted Rapanos' resignation, according to a statement from the prime minister's office.</p>

<p>Rapanos was hospitalized Friday after suffering from acute nausea and dizziness.</p>

<p>The development is a potential set-back for the new government in Athens, which has been in power for less than one week.</p>

<p>The coalition has promised to honor Greece's financial commitments, but it is also expected to renegotiate the terms of the nation's bailout package.</p>

<p>Rapanos' resignation comes ahead of a key meeting of European Union leaders on Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>Samaras, who was hospitalized last week for eye surgery, is not expected to attend the summit in Brussels. Â </p>
