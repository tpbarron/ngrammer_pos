<p>Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, co-chairs of President Obama's debt commission, launched a new campaign called Fix the Debt, One goal: Get 10 million signatures calling on Congress to act.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A new campaign launched Tuesday aims to create public support for lawmakers who have been too afraid to back a bipartisan debt-reduction plan.</p>

<p>A key goal of the Fix the Debt campaign is to get 10 million signatures for an online petition that will call on Congress to pass a comprehensive long-term plan by July 4, 2013.</p>

<p>Fix the Debt was created by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, who co-chaired President Obama's debt reduction commission in 2010.</p>

<p>Besides doing outreach to educate the public, the campaign will encourage lawmakers to use the Bowles-Simpson plan as a starting point for their negotiations this year and next.</p>

<p>That plan would reduce debt by $4 trillion over a decade by cutting defense and discretionary spending, curbing federal entitlement costs and reforming the tax code.</p>

<p>It garnered a majority of votes on the presidential commission -- 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans and one independent -- but not the supermajority required to send the plan to Congress for a vote.</p>

<p>A main criticism of Bowles-Simpson had been that it was not written in legislative language -- which is where the rubber meets the road in terms of the details of any proposal.</p>

<p>Now, however, a legislative version is circulating among some members of Congress, who are offering feedback, Bowles said. The original 66-page report has morphed into a more than 600-page-bill.</p>

<p>Among the campaign's core principles is that any final debt-reduction plan must affect all parts of the budget, preserve economic growth and protect the needy, said Fix the Debt co-chair Ed Rendell, the former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, at a press conference.</p>

<p>The idea is to make it safe for Republicans to consider raising more revenue without fear of political blowback and for Democrats to consider reducing entitlement and other spending.</p>

<p>"It's necessary to create an environment where it's not only good policy to sign such a plan but good politics as well," said Rendell, who will work alongside former Republican Sen. Judd Gregg, the campaign's other co-chair.</p>

<p>The Fix the Debt campaign has also created a CEO/Business Leaders Fiscal Leadership Council, to which more than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies have signed on, Bowles said.Â </p>
