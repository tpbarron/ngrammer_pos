<p>You can get cheap student loan rates for college -- if you know where to look.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- In a world of tuition hikes and financial aid shortages, this is what passes for good news: Families who must borrow for college have a growing number of low-cost alternatives to federal loans.</p>

<p>That's especially hopeful given that the last-minute cut in this year's subsidized Stafford rates to 3.4% helps only students with financial "need" -- those who don't qualify are still stuck paying 6.8% (plus 1% in fees).</p>

<p>Among their other options: For-profit lenders such as Sallie Mae and Wells Fargo are marketing parent loans at fixed rates as low as 5.5%.</p>

<p>SoFi, a San Francisco startup, has persuaded alumni at more than three dozen colleges to lend to students at rates starting around 6%.</p>

<p>Plus, several charities, states, and colleges are making lower-rate loans, in some cases as low as 0%.</p>

<p>Where to find low-rate loans</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no central clearinghouse. Check out overturemarketplace.com and simpletuition.com for private loans from for-profits and credit unions, but stick to fixed-rate options. (While you can get variable-rate loans as low as 2.25%, the rates are likely to rise at some point.)</p>

<p>For state, charity, school, and startup programs, begin with these lists of low-interest student loans and 0% student loans.</p>

<p>Students should also ask their school's aid office, as well as community organizations like Rotary clubs and religious institutions.</p>

<p>How to make the right choice</p>

<p>Apply for federal loans first so you have that option in your pocket, advises Heather Jarvis, a student-loan attorney.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to win a cheaper loan, read the fine print. Bargain loans may require borrowers to max out federal student loans first, have co-signers, or make payments during school.</p>

<p>Also, weigh the rate against the benefits of the federal loan.</p>

<p>You may find the Stafford's income-based repayment and public-service forgiveness options are worth paying for. Finally, don't use cheap loans as an excuse to overborrow: Students should keep total college debt below their expected first-year salary. Â </p>
