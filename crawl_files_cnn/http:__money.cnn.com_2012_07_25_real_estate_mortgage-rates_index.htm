<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Mortgage rates continued their downward plunge this week, reaching new all-time lows for both the 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate loans.</p>

<p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped 0.04 percentage point to 3.49%, according to the weekly survey by Freddie Mac. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed-rate fell to 2.80% from 2.83% the week before. Rates have fallen or matched lows for 13 of the past 14 weeks.</p>

<p>The faltering economic recovery -- both at home and in Europe -- has kept rates on the long slide.</p>

<p>"Market concerns over the strength of the economic recovery brought long-term Treasury yields to new lows this week, allowing fixed mortgage rates to reach record levels," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie's chief economist.</p>

<p>The bumpy road to European economic recovery has also been keeping rates from gaining any ground, according to Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a provider of mortgage information and analysis.</p>

<p>"Fresh worries about Spain's ability to manage its fiscal troubles gives global investors more reasons to pump money into the safety of U.S. Treasury debt, driving yields lower," he said.</p>

<p>Mortgage rates track 10-year bond yields so when they fall, rates soon follow. The 10-year yield dropped 0.04 percentage point in the five days ended July 20 and continued to trend downward this week.</p>

<p>With borrowing costs so low, the savings for homeowners who refinance their loans can be enormous. Switching from a 5% mortgage to a 3.49% rate can lop $178 a month off of payments on a $200,000 loan. That adds up to $2,136 in savings a year.</p>

<p>And many homeowners are trying to take advantage of these dirt-cheap rates. In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that refinance applications reached their highest level since 2009 last week. Refinance loans accounted for 81% of all applications fielded by its members.</p>

<p>Applications for purchase loans are more likely to be approved than refis, however, said Karen Mayfield, national mortgage sales manager for the Bank of the West.</p>

<p>"The pull-through on purchase loans is higher because it's easier for appraisers to hit the number," she said.</p>

<p>With home purchases, appraisers can more easily find homes that recently sold for similar prices and compare them to the home they're evaluating, said Mayfield.</p>

<p>With refis, however, they don't have a comparable selling price as a starting point. And many refis are denied amid concerns that the loan amount exceeds the home's appraised value.</p>

<p>Still, anyone who is paying off a mortgage at 5% or more should try to refinance it, according to Mayfield.</p>

<p>"Some people think it's harder to get a loan than it really is," she said.Â </p>
