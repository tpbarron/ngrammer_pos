<p>Fatter paychecks did not produce more spending by consumers in June.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Consumers enjoyed a healthy increase in income in June, but that didn't get them to open their wallets, according to a government report released Tuesday.</p>

<p>Income rose 0.5% from the prior month, according to the report from the Commerce Department, the best improvement in paychecks since March. Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a 0.4% rise.</p>

<p>The rise in income means that incomes are now up 3.5% compared to June 2011, the best 12-month gain in income so far this year. It also was roughly twice the pace of increase in prices over the last year.</p>

<p>But spending by consumers remained unchanged, and the May reading was revised to a 0.1% drop from being flat. Economists had expected a 0.1% increase in June.</p>

<p>Controlling for inflation, spending actually fell 0.1% in the latest reading.</p>

<p>Income and spending are both important to the nation's overall economic health. Spending by consumers makes up more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. While the increase in income is a good sign, the reluctance of consumers to spend could keep economic growth weaker than had been hoped.</p>

<p>Other government readings on retail spending have shown a steady decline for the last several months, driven partly by the drop in gasoline prices, which has allowed consumers to hang onto more of their income.</p>

<p>This report doesn't break down spending on gasoline specifically, but spending on energy overall fell 2.1% in this reading. But spending on durable goods, typically big ticket items like cars and appliances, also fell 0.1%, while spending on nondurable goods other than energy, such as food, was essentially unchanged.</p>

<p>Only a 0.2% increase in spending on services prevented a drop in overall spending.</p>

<p>While gas prices have started to rise again in recent weeks, that rise happened after this latest economic reading was taken.</p>

<p>The combination of rising income and no spending growth helped to improve the nation's savings rate, lifting it to 4.4% from 4% in May.</p>

<p>Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank, said that the improved savings rate puts U.S. households in a good position to start spending again soon, since they have more cash relative to debt than at any time in the last 10 years.</p>

<p>"We expect consumer spending to accelerate after what was an intra-second quarter slowdown," he wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.Â </p>
