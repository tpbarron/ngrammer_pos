<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner reached a deal to avert the risk of a government shutdown. But Congress won't vote on that deal until this fall.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The Federal Reserve has made clear it's standing down for now on more steps to aid the economy.</p>

<p>So the job is back to Congress.</p>

<p>The U.S. economy, of course, faces a lot of risks. But one of the biggest is Congress itself.</p>

<p>And it's a risk that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said repeatedly he can't counteract if lawmakers fail to agree on how to lessen the impact of the fiscal cliff.</p>

<p>That cliff is made up of $7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts set to start taking effect 5 months from now.</p>

<p>Economists have warned that letting those policies take effect in full could push the economy into a recession next year.</p>

<p>"[I]f no action were to be taken, the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there's I think absolutely no chance that the Federal Reserve ... could or would have any ability whatsoever to offset ... that effect on the economy," Bernanke said a few months ago.</p>

<p>This month he was equally blunt, noting it is not the Fed's role to crack the whip on lawmakers to act fiscally responsible. "Congress is in charge here," he said.</p>

<p>So is Congress taking charge? Lawmakers are trying to show that they're taking charge.</p>

<p>Leaders from both parties have made much of two bipartisan deals reached this week that must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>The first is an agreement to fund the government for the first six months of fiscal year 2013, which starts in October.</p>

<p>"This agreement reached between the Senate, the House and the White House provides stability for the coming months," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Except that it really won't.</p>

<p>Sure, it would prevent the threat of a government shutdown. But it does nothing to address any of the measures of the fiscal cliff, except to establish the funding level from which the so-called sequester of spending cuts must be made. Other than that, "this deal doesn't affect the sequester whatsoever," said budget expert Stan Collender.</p>

<p>The measure won't be voted on until lawmakers return from summer recess in September.</p>

<p>Then there's the bipartisan deal cut Wednesday by the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate's tax-writing committee. That deal will extend for a year many smaller tax breaks that are set to expire or already have, and it eliminates 25% of the "usual" tax extenders.</p>

<p>"This win shows we're able to come together to tackle tough problems," said Sen. Max Baucus, the committee chairman.</p>

<p>Ranking member Orrin Hatch described it as a "first step towards ... tax reform that shows that there is a path to resolving the challenges we face as a nation."</p>

<p>But as tough problems and first steps go, it's not that hard or that big a leap to agree on extending many popular tax breaks and add the cost -- an estimated $205 billion -- to deficits.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the House this week had a predictable partisan debate over how to extend the Bush tax cuts -- a major part of the fiscal cliff. The Republican-preferred version passed.</p>

<p>But it will go nowhere in the Senate, which went through the same exercise last week. The Senate passed the Democratic-preferred version, which will go nowhere in the House.</p>

<p>Then there's the specter of the nearly $1 trillion in spending cuts -- half in defense and half in non-defense -- that neither party likes but which Congress has yet to seriously focus on replacing.</p>

<p>The House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday held a hearing to discuss how the Obama administration will direct federal agencies to plan for the cuts.</p>

<p>Some of the hearing stayed on point, but the rest devolved into a blame game.</p>

<p>First there was back-and-forth on who is to blame for the sequester in the first place. Then it switched to which party is to blame for holding up a Bush tax cut extension. And then finally conversation turned to who was to blame for turning the hearing on a very bipartisan issue into a partisan food fight.</p>

<p>It was, in short, a microcosm of the endless back-and-forth that's been going on for more than a year in Congress.Â </p>
