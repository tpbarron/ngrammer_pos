<p>Mortgage rose slightly higher this week.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages climbed slightly higher this week, breaking a run that saw rates match or set new record lows for 13 out of the past 14 weeks.</p>

<p>The rate on 30-year fixed mortgages rose to 3.55% from 3.49% last week, Freddie Mac said in its weekly report. Last year at this time, the mortgage rate averaged 4.39%.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage -- popular among those seeking to refinance -- also inched slightly higher to 2.83% from 2.80%. Last year, it averaged 3.54%.</p>

<p>The increase in rates followed several positive economic announcements, including debt relief efforts in the Europe, an increase in U.S. consumer confidence in July and a report indicating that home prices are on the rise, according to Frank Nothaft, Freddie's chief economist.</p>

<p>"Recent announcements of additional debt relief for the Eurozone and mixed domestic economic indicators added upward pressure on Treasury yields as well as mortgage rates this week," he said.</p>

<p>Mortgage rates tend to track yields on Treasurys, which also climbed slightly higher this week.</p>

<p>Nothaft also pointed out that while there was a mixed bag of housing news -- including a disappointing report on pending home sales in June -- home prices are on the upswing again. In May, home prices climbed for the fourth consecutive month, according to the S&P Case-Shiller 20-city home-price index.</p>

<p>Even though rates and home prices have climbed higher, buying a home still remains extremely cheap.</p>

<p>A $200,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage costs just $904 a month, compared with the $1,013 it would cost a year ago, when rates averaged 4.4%. Five years ago, that same mortgage would have carried an average rate of 6.5% and cost $1,264 a month.</p>

<p>The low rates are likely to stick around for awhile, according to Greg McBride, a financial analyst with Bankrate.com,</p>

<p>"[This week's increase] is more likely to be a temporary retreat than a lasting turn," he said. "Mortgage rates will stay very low given the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the economy, fiscal cliff, and European debt circus." Â </p>
