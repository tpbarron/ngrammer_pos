<p>Starting in September, eBay is blocking the sale of potions and other magical goods.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Sorry, love spell vendors: eBay is cracking down on the sale of magical wares.</p>

<p>Beginning in September, the site is banning the sale of "advice, spells, curses, hexing, conjuring, magic, prayers, blessing services, magic potions, [and] healing sessions," according to a policy update.</p>

<p>The company is also eliminating its category listings for psychic readings and tarot card sessions.</p>

<p>The update is a part of a "multi-year effort...to build trust in the marketplace and support sellers," eBay (EBAY, Fortune 500) wrote in its company blog.</p>

<p>Has anyone actually been buying magic on eBay? It seems so: The site's "spells and potions" category currently has more than 6,000 active listings and happy feedback from quite a few satisfied buyers.</p>

<p>"Best spell caster on Ebay," one customer wrote after a recent purchase.</p>

<p>"Wonderful post-spells communication!" another raved. "We bought 4 spells! Highly Recommend!"</p>

<p>Spells and hexes aside, eBay is rolling out a long list of rule tweaks, as it does several times a year. For example, buyers will now be required to contact sellers before getting eBay involved with any issues regarding a purchase. Sellers will also be subject to a fee for ending an auction earlier than planned.</p>

<p>EBay also banned the sale of "work from home businesses & information," a category that is often abused by scammers.</p>

<p>EBay isn't the only online marketplace culling its listings. Etsy, a platform for homemade goods, also recently prohibited the sale of various items, including drug paraphernalia and body parts.</p>
