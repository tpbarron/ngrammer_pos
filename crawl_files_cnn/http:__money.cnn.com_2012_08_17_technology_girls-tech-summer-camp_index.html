<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Most school-aged girls spend July and August catching some Z's and sun. But for some girls, summer is all about learning HTML and developing mobile apps.</p>

<p>A growing handful of summer camps are popping up around the country with the mission of teaching young women core skills in technology -- a field dominated by men.</p>

<p>Girls Who Code, an eight-week New York summer camp, immerses 20 high school girls in a tech training boot camp. Eight hours a day, Monday through Friday, the young women learn about a wide variety of tech topics from robotics to website design.</p>

<p>Guest speakers include an eBay (EBAY, Fortune 500) executive, a venture capitalist, and a technology entrepreneur among some other in-the-know tech personalities. But participants don't spend all day in the classroom: They also take field trips to Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG, Fortune 500), Twitter, the United Nations and Gilt.</p>

<p>For their final project, Girls Who Code students develop and present an app.</p>

<p>"All the field trips have been so interesting and I can always find myself relating to parts of the topics presented," said 15-year-old Mahlika George, who's heading into her junior year at Medgar Evers College Preparatory School.</p>

<p>Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani said the organization hopes to get more girls interested in technology and consider the field as a real career possibility.</p>

<p>"I think young girls really internalize that sense that we're not good at math and science," Saujani said. "I don't want a young girl to feel that way."</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, just 24% of women hold STEM jobs -- occupations in science, technology, engineering or math. Only 12.7% of bachelor's degrees in computer science, computer engineering and information were received by women in the 2010-2011 school year, according to the most recent data from the Computer Research Association.</p>

<p>It's a gender gap that businesses are longing to fix. Women are more active Internet users than men, according to data from Pew, and they are far more engaged in social media.</p>

<p>Technology businesses could take advantage of that by leveraging the perspective of a greater number of female engineers, designers, coders and executives.</p>

<p>"We have no idea how much [these types of businesses] could do if women were actually designing the products," Saujani said. "I think every company wants to hire more women because it makes more business sense."</p>

<p>That's precisely why Twitter has become involved in the tech summer camp. As a partner of the program, the microblogging site admitted in a recent blog post that it has invested in rallying young women into technology, because "having more female engineers on staff leads to having an even better working environment at Twitter."</p>

<p>Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) has taken the issue so seriously that it started its own tech summer camp for girls. The software giant's DigiGirlz High Tech camp hosts about a dozen sessions around the world each year, giving participants insight into the potential of holding a career in the industry.</p>

<p>Created in 2000 from a grassroots effort by two female Microsoft employees, the free, volunteer-run program has reached 19,000 young women cumulatively, said Jacinda Chislum, a DigiGirlz representative.</p>

<p>Other tech camps are aimed at giving girls the ability to turn their coding skills into businesses. Philadelphia-based TechGirlz set up a weeklong program to address the fact that only 3% of tech startups are led by women, according to a study by Kauffman Foundation.</p>

<p>In the organization's summer entrepreneur program, 19 girls ages nine to 16 are thrown into what essentially amounts to a tech accelerator. The young women develop prototypes for websites or apps and write business plans. They wrap up the program with a demo day and make pitches to startup executives and developers.</p>

<p>This July, one team came up with a pet sitting app for clients and sitters. Another promoted a trading card website for kids.</p>

<p>"What has been shown is that girls are self-selecting out of technology because of how they feel computer jobs are -- that they're going to be thought of as a nerd ... [and] they're not going to be creative or collaborative," said Tracey Welson-Rossman, TechGirlz founder. "That's not the case. There's definitely a misperception and a misconception."</p>
