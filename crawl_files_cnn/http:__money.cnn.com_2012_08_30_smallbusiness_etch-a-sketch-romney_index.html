<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Months after an aide to Mitt Romney made his now infamous "Etch A Sketch" gaffe, the company that makes the iconic toy is still trying to cash in on it.</p>

<p>The Ohio Art Company has started selling limited-edition election versions of its Etch A Sketch for $19.99. The products come in two colors: red and blue, with a cover sticker showing a donkey and an elephant in a tug of war in front of the White House.</p>

<p>The new products, of course, were inspired by comments during a CNN interview in March by Eric Fehrnstrom, a Romney senior campaign adviser. Fehnrstrom suggested that the campaign could "like an Etch A Sketch," change its tone and "shake it up and restart all over again" as the general election neared.</p>

<p>The remark drove a 30% spike in Etch A Sketch sales the following week, said Martin Killgallon, the company's senior vice president of marketing. The Killgallon family holds a majority ownership of The Ohio Art Company.</p>

<p>"We never thought something of this magnitude would happen," he said. "I got hundreds of calls about it that day. Etch A Sketch was also the most-tweeted that week."</p>

<p>Killgallon said the company immediately started plotting ways it could capitalize on its unintended fame during the fourth quarter -- when toymakers make a bulk of their sales and profits for the year.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ohio Art revamped its Etch A Sketch website as ShakeitupAmerica.net. Visitors to the site can buy the special election Etch A Sketch or cast votes in an informal presidential poll.</p>

<p>The company is also selling the election products in independent toy stores and boutiques.</p>

<p>The promotional push includes bumper stickers, lawn signs, T-shirts and social media ads.</p>

<p>Among the slogans: "Etch A Sketch is a lot like politics. There's a lot of gray area" and "We have a left knob and a right knob for each political party."</p>

<p>Since Etch A Sketch debuted in 1960, the company has sold more than 150 million of them.</p>

<p>"It's our flagship brand," said Killgallon. He hopes the company's cheeky strategy will remind consumers about Etch a Sketch as they prepare this year's holiday gift lists.</p>

<p>His other wish: "Maybe the candidates will say they are Etch A Sketch candidates and they're ready to shake things up."</p>
