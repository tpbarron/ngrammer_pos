<p>Find a handyman to take on those home improvement projects you just can't seem to get to.</p>

<p>(Money Magazine) -- For a busy -- or simply hammerphobic -- homeowner, it sounds almost too good to be true: A hired handyman (or woman) could tackle your odd jobs for about a third of the cost, time, and hassle of a general contractor.</p>

<p>There are plenty of jacks-of-all-trades out there, but is it possible to find one you can really rely on? The answer is yes -- provided you know where to look and what chores to give him.</p>

<p>Pick the right project</p>

<p>"A handyman should do only things that a proficient homeowner could handle himself if he had the time," says "Handyman Fran" Carito of Watertown, Mass.</p>

<p>That might include installing a ceiling fan, freeing a stuck window sash, or replacing a light fixture, faucet, or cracked windowpane.</p>

<p>Go with a licensed tradesman instead for work inside walls, like replacing a pipe or adding an electrical circuit; specialized tasks (say, repairing a roof leak or installing tiles); and, of course, remodeling.</p>

<p>Tap your network</p>

<p>General contractors don't usually like to bother with small fix-up tasks anyway, so if you have a good working rapport with one, he might be willing to suggest one of his guys who takes side jobs.</p>

<p>Or ask a contact at a local school, church, or office park to recommend a staff handyman who does some moonlighting. Otherwise, check with friends for referrals.</p>

<p>A long-established local sole proprietor may be the most expert and reasonably priced option. A larger company, though, is more likely to carry insurance, especially if it's part of a national franchise such as Mr. Handyman or House Doctors.</p>

<p>Get an estimate</p>

<p>Unlike contractors, who name their price upfront, handymen bill you for the materials they use and the time they spend -- typically at around $40 to $70 an hour. That's because, ironically, it's trickier to commit to a fixed price for a little job, says Madison handyman Adam Shirley.</p>

<p>Still, ask for an estimate -- and consider setting a ceiling. For instance, you could designate a half-hour for trying to repair a dripping faucet before replacing it instead.</p>

<p>Start small</p>

<p>Just as you might audition a car mechanic with routine oil changes, test your new handyman's mettle with low-tech stuff, such as clearing clogged gutters or installing garage shelves.</p>

<p>It's best to combine a few of these small projects, since most pros either have a two- to four-hour minimum or impose a one-hour service charge. Then let him earn his way to bigger assignments that require craftsmanship -- and if he nails those, put his number on speed dial.</p>
