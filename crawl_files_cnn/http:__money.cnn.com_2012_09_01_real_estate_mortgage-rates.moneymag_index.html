<p>Mortgage rates hit or match new lows.</p>

<p>(MONEY Magazine) -- Mortgage rates have become a broken record -- in more ways than one.</p>

<p>In 12 of the 13 weeks from mid-April through mid-July, long-term home loan rates matched or hit new lows, as 30-year fixed loans fell to 3.53%, their lowest level in at least 40 years. (Since the end of July, they've edged up to 3.66%.)</p>

<p>Mortgages closely track Treasury yields, which have been flattened by investors seeking safety amid lackluster U.S. growth forecasts and European financial woes.</p>

<p>"No one expects rates to leave this range for quite a while," says Rick Allen of loan site Mortgage Marvel.</p>

<p>Rates on five-year adjustables were even lower at 2.74% -- $90 a month cheaper than a $200,000 30-year fixed. (Those adjustables are now at 2.8%.)</p>

<p>With fixed rates so low, though, adjustables make sense only if you move before the initial rate expires.</p>

<p>Doubt you have enough equity to refi? Under new HARP rules, you may be in luck if you are current on payments and have a pre-June 2009 mortgage held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.</p>
