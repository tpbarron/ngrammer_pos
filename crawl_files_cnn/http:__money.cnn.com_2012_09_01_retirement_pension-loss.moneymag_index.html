<p>Sheryll and Doug Evans of Colorado Springs were depending on his public pension.</p>

<p>(Money Magazine) -- Until recently Doug and Sheryll Evans believed they were on a straight path to retirement.</p>

<p>Doug, 51, has worked in IT for the same Colorado Springs hospital for 18 years, building up a hefty pension. Sheryll, 52, is a nursing director at a boarding school, where she gets free housing—allowing the couple to rent out their home. Plus, she has accrued a small pension of her own.</p>

<p>Their five grown kids are independent, and their combined $142,000 income has helped them stash $271,000 in 401(k)s.</p>

<p>"The plan was to work 30 years and have a nice retirement," says Doug.</p>

<p>Now a pending acquisition of his employer has them worried.</p>

<p>Doug had been on track to get $5,000 a month from the pension starting at age 60. If the new owner scraps the plan—a likely scenario—he'll gross $3,000.</p>

<p>Doug does have one option for upping his take: Pay $48,000 for extra service credits and start getting checks at 55, while still working. Should he do it?</p>

<p>Three Fixes</p>

<p>Plan to prepay for the pension. By paying $48,000 for the pension booster, Doug would be entitled to about $2,900 a month starting at age 55, vs. about $3,000 a month starting at 60. That's $174,000 extra over five years, money he can bank if he continues working.</p>

<p>"To get the same return on $48,000, you'd need to earn 15% a year," says Denver financial planner Bob Morrison. "It's a no-brainer."</p>

<p>Tap the home to raise funds. The Evanses don't have $48,000 in cash, but they should qualify for a cash-out refinance that would allow them to buy the credits and consolidate $14,000 in higher-interest RV and home-equity loans.</p>

<p>With a 4.75% rate—a conservative estimate for a rental property—they'll cut their total debt payments by $400 a month. Refinancing will add 11 years to their mortgage, but they can accelerate payments later.</p>

<p>Cram on retirement savings. Even with their pensions, the Evanses need to save more in order to retire in their mid-sixties and maintain their lifestyle, Morrison says.</p>

<p>He suggests they up 401(k) contributions—now $16,000 for Doug and $12,000 for Sheryll, with employer match—by $11,500 a year total.</p>

<p>Initially, some of that can come from cash freed by the refi; once Doug gets his pension at 55, he can save that much more.</p>
