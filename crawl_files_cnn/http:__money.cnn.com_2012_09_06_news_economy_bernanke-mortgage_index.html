<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke refinanced his mortgage last year, but otherwise, his financial disclosures show only plain-vanilla investments.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke refinanced his mortgage last year, taking advantage of low interest rates influenced by the central bank.</p>

<p>Bernanke refinanced a 30-year mortgage at a 4.25% rate, according to financial disclosure documents released Thursday.</p>

<p>Nationwide, the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 4.45% in 2011, but recently fell as low as 3.49% in July of this year, according to Freddie Mac.</p>

<p>Low interest rates are a direct result of the Federal Reserve's policies, which have been aimed at stimulating economic growth since the financial crisis of 2008.</p>

<p>Not including real estate, Bernanke's financial assets totaled at least $1.07 million last year. His investments are rather plain vanilla, consisting largely of annuities and cash in checking and money market accounts.</p>

<p>That stands in stark contrast to some of his Fed colleagues. Financial statements released from 2010 show Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher owned more than 7,000 acres of land, $1 million in gold and even as much as $250,000 in uranium.</p>

<p>Some others had individual stocks in their portfolios.</p>

<p>Bernanke earned at least $150,000 in textbook royalties last year. His current salary, set by Congress, is $199,700 a year.</p>

<p>In a speech last week, Bernanke hinted that the central bank is considering more easing, given the unemployment rate remains high at 8.3%. He characterized the weak job market as a "grave concern" causing "enormous suffering and waste of human talent" -- one of the gloomiest statements yet from the Fed chairman.</p>

<p>Options could include a third round of large asset purchases, or extended guidance on low interest rate expectations. The Fed currently forecasts interest rates will remain "exceptionally low" until late 2014.</p>

<p>The Fed's policymaking team meets September 12-13, and Bernanke will discuss their latest decision in a press conference shortly afterward.</p>
