<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- J.C. Penney announced an unconventional new promotion Monday in a bid to take a cut out of the competition.</p>

<p>In an email to customers, CEO Ron Johnson said that starting in November, kids from kindergarten to sixth grade can get free haircuts every Sunday at J.C. Penney (JCP, Fortune 500) stores.</p>

<p>The announcement follows J.C. Penney's previous offer of free back-to-school haircuts for kids. Johnson said that promotion had been "far bigger than I expected," leading the company to give away over 1.6 million free haircuts in August.</p>

<p>Johnson joined J.C. Penney last year from Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500), where he was the brains behind the company's Apple Store retail chain. He's since announced a series of new initiatives aimed at revamping the struggling J.C. Penney.</p>

<p>The company overhauled its pricing earlier this year, moving away from short-lived sales and discounts in favor of a three-tiered pricing structure: everyday low prices, month-long sales on seasonal items and "best prices," or clearance promotions. Johnson later acknowledged that this had proved confusing to customers, however, and pared down the price levels to two: everyday low prices and clearance.</p>

<p>J.C. Penney has also begun launching shops dedicated to particular brands like Levi's and Liz Claiborne within its larger department stores , and hopes to eliminate checkout counters by 2014 in favor of mobile- and self-checkout.</p>

<p>Johnson faces a mighty task in his turnaround effort. J.C. Penney lost $147 million during the second quarter, nearly three times more than analysts were expecting, and shares are down 18% so far this year.</p>
