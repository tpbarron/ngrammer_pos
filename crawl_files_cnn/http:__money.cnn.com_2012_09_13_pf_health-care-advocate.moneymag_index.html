<p>To find the right kind of health-care provider, you have to think outside of the medicine bag.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (Money Magazine) -- Your primary-care doctor can be a gatekeeper for all sorts of specialized care, but there are some things he can't do. Maybe you're dealing with a non-medical issue such as billing, for example, or making a care plan for a loved one.</p>

<p>"In our fragmented health care system, doctors don't speak to each other," says Byron Cordes, president of the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers.</p>

<p>Here are four times to try a different kind of provider:</p>

<p>For billing or treatment problems</p>

<p>Who: Health care advocate</p>

<p>Why use one: Up to 80% of medical bills contain costly errors; an advocate can help you sort out the mess. Struggling to make a decision about care for an ongoing issue? An advocate can also help you get a second opinion and figure out the best treatment plan.</p>

<p>Where to find one: You can find local advocates via companies like Best Doctors or HealthCare Advocates, which contract with large companies that offer this service as a perk.</p>

<p>Besides several years' experience, you want to have an advocate who works as part of a team, to fill in any gaps in his knowledge, says Joanna Smith, founder of the National Association of Healthcare Advocacy Consultants. The advocate should also be willing to sign a service agreement detailing the nature of the work he'll perform and what he'll be paid.</p>

<p>For end-of-life care and serious conditions</p>

<p>Who: Palliative-care workers</p>

<p>Why use them: People commonly use these specially trained hospital-based teams (often a doctor, nurse, social worker, and chaplain) to help manage loved ones' end-of-life care. But palliative-care workers can also assist patients and their families outside the hospital in coping with severe, chronic illnesses.</p>

<p>They might help a cancer patient weigh the pluses and minuses of undergoing another round of chemo, for example, or work with an HIV patient to reduce nausea and pain.</p>

<p>Studies show that patients who receive early palliative care sometimes live longer and have a better quality of life than those who don't, and their health care costs are often lower.</p>

<p>Where to find one: Most large hospitals and some nursing homes offer palliative-care services; Go to www.getpalliativecare.org/providers to find one in your area.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For elder-care issues</p>

<p>Who: Geriatric-care manager</p>

<p>Why use one: These pros, usually nurses or social workers, do anything from researching assisted-living facilities to getting meds delivered to providing referrals to elder-law attorneys.</p>

<p>"We find the chinks in seniors' armor and make recommendations to fix them," says Cordes. Getting the right medical care and other support upfront means Mom is less likely to undergo a scary, expensive hospital stay.</p>

<p>Where to find one: Find local help via the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers. You want someone who is knowledgeable in the area you need -- a nurse is best for medication management, for example -- and has a minimum of two years' experience.</p>

<p>When fighting mild ailments</p>

<p>Who: Your company doctor</p>

<p>Why use one: Boss not happy about your taking half a day off work to get a prescription for pinkeye?</p>

<p>Nearly half of large firms offer on-site health clinics staffed by MDs and registered nurses. While they usually handle mild issues like fever or flu, they also increasingly are providing primary-care and wellness services, from physicals to diabetes management.</p>

<p>Some clinics even welcome employees' children and spouses, as well as retirees, says Bruce Hochstadt, a health and benefits consultant at Mercer.</p>

<p>Where to find one: In your building. Some small firms may have clinics at central locations. Check with your HR department to see what's available.</p>
