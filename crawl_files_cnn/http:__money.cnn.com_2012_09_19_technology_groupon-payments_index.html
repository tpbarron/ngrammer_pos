<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Groupon is throwing down hard in the mobile payment space, with a guarantee that its new Payments service is "the lowest-cost option" for merchants who run a daily deal with the company.</p>

<p>Groupon Payments, which is available through an app for the company's merchants, is the latest entry in the white-hot mobile payments field. Groupon's rate is 1.8% plus 15 cents per swiped transaction for MasterCard (MA, Fortune 500), Visa (V, Fortune 500) and Discover (DFS, Fortune 500) cards. For American Express (AXP, Fortune 500), it's 3% plus 15 cents per transaction.</p>

<p>That's a pretty sweet deal for retailers. The swipe fees that credit cards typically charge can vary from one small business to another, but they usually fall between 2-4% of the transaction for credit cards (debit card rates are typically lower). Shares of Groupon (GRPN) were up more than 7% in midday trading after the announcement. The deal is available to U.S. merchants only, for now.</p>

<p>Can Groupon actually make money on this arrangement, or is it a loss-leader intended to grow the company's discounts business? The company isn't saying.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't comment on profit or loss. It doesn't make sense to do that. But I can say that we want to make a real business out of this," said Mihir Shah, Groupon's vice president of mobile and merchant products.</p>

<p>Groupon developed the idea for Payments, Shah said, after the company realized many merchants couldn't answer a simple question: What rate are you paying for transactions? The mission is "to slash the complexity and costs of accepting credit card payments" -- and Groupon is planning to roll out other services aimed at simplifying life for merchants, he said.</p>

<p>In some cases, Groupon Payments severely undercuts even low-cost competitors like Square. The startup, backed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, lets small business swipe credit cards through a tiny device that attaches to a phone. Square offers two plans for businesses: pay one flat fee of $275 per month, or pay 2.75% per swipe. EBay (EBAY, Fortune 500)-owned PayPal charges 2.7% per swipe.</p>

<p>Square, which has raised more than $200 million in funding and is valued at more than $3.2 billion, is just one of the companies trying to lead the fast-growing mobile payments space. The list also includes Google (GOOG, Fortune 500), which is pushing its Wallet service, and financial services companies like VeriFone (PAY) and NCR (NCR, Fortune 500).</p>

<p>Though Groupon Payments is designed for businesses that run daily deals through the company, a temporary pilot program for non-Groupon merchants offers rates of 2.2% for most cards (3% for American Express) plus 15 cents per swipe.</p>
