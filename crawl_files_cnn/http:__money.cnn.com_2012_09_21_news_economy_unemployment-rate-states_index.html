<p>North Carolina's unemployment rate ticked up a tenth of a percentage point to 9.7%, also as construction workers lost jobs.</p>

<p>Jobless rates in other battleground states -- including New Hampshire, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- also rose.</p>

<p>In 12 states, the unemployment rates fell in August. Only two -- Colorado and New Mexico -- were swing states.</p>
