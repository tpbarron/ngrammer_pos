<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Ike Sutton, an aspiring inventor and father of six, was fed up with smartphones intruding on family time.</p>

<p>"Nobody would put away their cellphones because everything was 'urgent,'" he said.</p>

<p>You know: Urgent! Like checking movie times, sharing Instagram pictures from grandma and texting friends -- instead of interacting with the person sitting, say, three feet away.</p>

<p>It was the same thing at restaurants, he said. "It wasn't just us. I looked around and everyone else was on their cellphones, too."</p>

<p>The product designer, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., turned his frustration into a small business idea. He invented the Cell Lock-Up.</p>

<p>The Cell Lock-Up is a toy jail cell where iPhones, BlackBerrys and Galaxys -- up to six at a time -- can be imprisoned. Mandatory minimum sentence: 15 minutes. Maximum: One hour.</p>

<p>The toy, priced at $19.99, is a 7-inch cube that looks like a jail cell. It has a bunk bed so cellphones can double up. If someone tries to break a device out the toy slammer, an alarm sounds and a recorded voice barks "Alert! Alert! Break-out in progress."</p>

<p>"I thought this could be a cute but effective way to get the point across," said Sutton, who is 47.</p>

<p>Sutton, who also works as a product design and marketing consultant for toys and novelty gifts maker EB Brands, presented the idea to the company a year ago.</p>

<p>"As soon as we saw it, we knew it could be a star product for us this holiday season," said Steve Wasik, president of EB Brands. "I have two boys and I've warned them that I'll be bringing one home."</p>

<p>EB Brands offered Sutton a royalty agreement for Cell Lock-Up that pays him a percentage of sales. Sutton declined to offer further details.</p>

<p>Cell Lock-Up will hit the market in October and sell in Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY, Fortune 500), Sears (SHLD, Fortune 500) and Lord & Taylor, among other stores, as well as on Amazon (AMZN, Fortune 500), said Wasik.</p>

<p>And Sutton, who filed for a patent six months ago, is weighing how to expand on his idea. Among them: a travel version for cars.</p>
