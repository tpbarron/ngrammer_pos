<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Republicans aren't generally thought to be the most environmentally-conscious voters. But a new poll shows Mitt Romney supporters are more likely to have made green home improvements than supporters of President Obama.</p>

<p>Sixty-four percent of Romney supporters said they had made home improvements that could be considered "green" over the past five years, according to a survey released Monday by Harris Interactive and the solar power company Sunrun. Those improvements included things like buying energy efficient appliances and installing low-flow toilets.</p>

<p>Only 58% of Obama supporters reported taking similar steps.</p>

<p>"This data shows us that a new shade of green is emerging, and it's not dominated by any particular side of the political spectrum," Sunrun President Lynn Jurich said in a statement.</p>

<p>Romney supporters were also slightly more likely to have installed solar panels on their homes. Three percent of Romney supporters went solar recently, compared to only 2% of Obama supporters, according to the survey.</p>

<p>A desire to save money appears to be the motivating factor for both sides though. Eighty-five percent of the respondents said lower energy costs was what motivated them to go green. Concern for the environment was actually the least mentioned factor.</p>

<p>Only 33% of Romney supporters believe in global warming, according to the poll.</p>

<p>But wealth is also a factor. Romney supporters tend to be older and more likely to both own a home and have the money to make green home improvements, said CNN pollster Keating Holland.</p>

<p>"You don't make improvements to a place that you rent," said Holland. "Obama supporters, who are younger, are more likely to be renters."</p>

<p>Obama supporters were more likely to have made green lifestyle choices, including buying organic foods and recycling, the Harris poll showed.</p>
