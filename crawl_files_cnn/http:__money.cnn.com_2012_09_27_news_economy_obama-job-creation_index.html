<p>About 4.3 million jobs were lost in Obama's first year, but new data released Thursday show about 4.4 million jobs have been added back since then.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Republicans may soon lose a key talking point. According to data released Thursday, President Obama may now be a net job creator.</p>

<p>In the year following Obama's inauguration, the U.S. economy lost about 4.3 million jobs. But new figures released Thursday show 4.4 million jobs have been added back since then.</p>

<p>Here's how it happened: Since early 2010, jobs have slowly been trickling back, particularly in professional services, health care and manufacturing. As of August, the Labor Department had indicated about 4 million jobs had been recovered overall.</p>

<p>Those figures get revised frequently though, as the Labor Department gets more complete data over time. On Thursday, the Labor Department released a statement, saying it crunched the numbers again, using unemployment insurance records that employers are required to file.</p>

<p>Based on that data, the government now believes it under-counted jobs created in much of 2011 by around 386,000. That's according to preliminary figures that the government could still tweak slightly in February.</p>

<p>If true, those figures mean the economy has recovered 4.4 million jobs since early 2010 -- enough to fully account for the jobs lost in Obama's first term. In fact, Obama would be ahead by exactly 125,000 jobs.</p>

<p>The President is unlikely to brag about that on the campaign trail though. In a blog post Thursday, his top economic adviser in the White House, Alan Krueger, said the new data shows "the jobs recovery over the last 2.5 years has been a bit stronger than initially reported, although much work remains to be done to return to full employment."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Republican nominee Mitt Romney still has plenty of fodder to criticize Obama on economic issues.</p>

<p>"President Obama's administration promised, with the passage of the stimulus, that unemployment would currently be at 5.4% with 9 million more people working," Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in a statement, referring to a 2009 report by Obama's then chief economic adviser, Christina Romer.</p>

<p>"With unemployment at 8% or higher for the 43rd consecutive month and 23 million Americans struggling for work, President Obama's policies have failed miserably by his own standards," Saul added.</p>

<p>Given that the jobs decline started before Obama entered office, employment is still far below 2007 levels.</p>

<p>Hiring has barely been strong enough to keep up with population growth, and that's why the unemployment rate is still stuck at 8.1%.</p>

<p>A survey of households shows the U.S. population has grown 3.8% since Obama entered office, but jobs have only grown by 1.5% over that same time period.</p>

<p>About 12.5 million Americans were still counted as unemployed in August.</p>
