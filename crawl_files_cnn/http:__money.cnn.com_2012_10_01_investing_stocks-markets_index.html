<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A rally on Wall Street lost steam Monday afternoon following comments from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.</p>

<p>The major indexes initially jumped about 1% after a stronger-than-expected report on U.S. manufacturing, but pulled back from the day's highs as Bernanke defended the central bank's latest stimulus action.</p>

<p>The Fed chief said the economy "simply has not been growing fast enough recently to make significant progress in bringing down unemployment." The unemployment rate has been stuck just above 8% since the start of the year.</p>

<p>Bernanke also pressed Congress to address the so-called fiscal cliff -- the onset of higher taxes and reduced spending at the beginning of 2013. Without action from lawmakers, the fiscal cliff could throw the economy back into recession.</p>

<p>The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day up 0.6%. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% while the Nasdaq fell slightly.</p>

<p>Financial stocks closed solidly higher. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500) were up almost 3%, while Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Fortune 500) rose almost 1.5%.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index, a survey of purchasing managers, came in at 51.5 for September, marking the first expansion in the U.S. manufacturing sector in four months.</p>

<p>The report boosted hopes that "some of the recent slowdown in economic growth was just a summer phenomenon," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p>

<p>Wall Street took also took early cues from European markets, which rallied after Spain passed two major hurdles last week when it proposed its 2013 budget and results from bank stress tests were in line with expectations. Britain's FTSE 100 added 1.4%, the DAX in Germany advanced 1.5% and France's CAC 40 increased 2.4%.</p>

<p>A report on eurozone manufacturing showed continued contraction, but the 46.1 figure for September was a six-month high. Any reading below 50 signals contraction. Still, unemployment remains worrisome, with the region's jobless rate coming in at a record high of 11.4% in August, unchanged from the previous month's revised figure.</p>

<p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei declined 0.8% after a central bank survey showed business sentiment has fallen. Markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday. A report on manufacturing activity in China rose to 49.8 in September, up from 49.2 in the prior month.</p>
