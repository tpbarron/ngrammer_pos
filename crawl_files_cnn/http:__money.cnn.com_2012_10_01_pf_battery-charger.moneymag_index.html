<p>Pick out the best pocket-sized battery charger for how you use your device.</p>

<p>(Money Magazine) -- Fact of life: The more you use a gadget, the more likely its battery will be dead just when you need it most. If you're tired of hunting for outlets, try a pocket-size battery charger.</p>

<p>MONEY put three through their paces.</p>

<p>FOR GADGET-HEADS ONLY</p>

<p>Iogear High Capacity Mobile Power Station Power rating: 6½ stars Weight: 7.2 ounces Price: $48 How it works: If the inside of your bag looks like a Best Buy, you may be willing to carry extra weight to get a charger that powers multiple devices. The Power Station has dual USB outputs, one for phones and one for tablets. It's bulkier than the others, but it fully charged an iPad 2 and brought an iPhone back to 100% four times over. (It can also power up most USB or micro-USB devices.)</p>

<p>FOR EVERYONE (BEST OVERALL)</p>

<p>Innergie PocketCell Power rating: 3 stars Weight: 2.6 ounces Price: $68 How it works: The lightest and most totable of the bunch, the slick-looking PocketCell took an iPhone battery from dead to 100% charged, with juice left over. It can fully charge an e-reader, and gave the iPad an extra four hours of life. The battery also spares users from sorting through a jumble of cords, thanks to its three-in-one cable with fold-out connectors for Apple, mini-USB, and micro-USB devices.</p>

<p>FOR WIRE-PHOBES ONLY</p>

<p>Duracell 24-Hour Power System for iPhone Power rating: 1½ stars Weight: 3.2 ounces Price: $91 How it works: Hate keeping tabs on multiple device chargers? This two-in-one system combines a portable battery with a home charging mat. The mat can wirelessly juice an iPhone (the phone must be in the included case) or revive the portable battery, case-free. The mobile battery itself delivers little bang for your buck, though: It left the iPhone just short of a full charge.</p>

<p>Power rating: Each star equals five hours added talk time. Power ratings determined by MONEY tests using an iPhone 4S.</p>

<p>Battery Boosters</p>

<p>Go into your phone's settings and make these tweaks to ward off the Red Icon of Impending Doom.</p>

<p>Dim the lights. Dial down screen brightness. If available, enable the auto-brightness feature, which adjusts based on ambient light.</p>

<p>Turn off extras. Disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS features when you're not using them. And don't use power-draining animated wallpapers.</p>

<p>Pare down pop-ups. Limit push notifications -- those annoying messages that show up even when you're not using an app -- to essentials like texts.</p>

<p>Have an emergency plan. Switching from 4G to a slower 3G cellular network can eke a few more minutes of life out of a dying battery.</p>
