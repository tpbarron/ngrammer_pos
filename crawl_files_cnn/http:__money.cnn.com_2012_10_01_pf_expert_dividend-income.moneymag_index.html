<p>(Money Magazine) -- "I'd like to live off dividend income when I retire. How should I invest my portfolio?" -- Mike Sargent, Colorado Springs</p>

<p>With anxiety about the market running high and yields on bonds and CDs exceedingly low, dividend-paying stocks and funds have become the darlings of savers like you, who are looking to generate a steady income.</p>

<p>So far this year investors have poured $22 billion into mutual funds and ETFs that specialize in dividend stocks, even as they've yanked $25 billion out of all other stock funds and ETFs, according to EPFR Global.</p>

<p>Think twice before you join that hot pursuit. While it's true that MONEY has long recommended dividends for income investors, I find that many people have an unrealistic view of what these stocks can do for them -- and underestimate the potential risks, especially at today's prices.</p>

<p>The dividend illusion</p>

<p>You might think that by living off dividend payments you're avoiding the "sin" of dipping into capital. But that's just an illusion.</p>

<p>Because cash the company once had in its coffers is being paid out to shareholders, the stock of a company that declares a dividend subsequently drops by the amount of that payment. Yet with so many things going on at once in the market, this is easy to miss.</p>

<p>If you invest, say, $100,000 in 1,000 shares of a stock that sells for $100 and pays a 50Â¢-a-share quarterly dividend, you would still have your original hundred grand (assuming the stock didn't move for any other reason), except that you'd end up with $500 in cash and $99,500 in stock. Spend that $500, and you've essentially dipped into your capital.</p>

<p>You'll be no better off than the owner of 1,000 shares of a $100 non-dividend-paying company who sells five shares for $500 -- a strategy that the late economist Merton Miller famously referred to as creating "homemade dividends."</p>

<p>When you rely on dividends, you're tying your cash flow to a corporate policy decision that has nothing to do with your needs. Selling shares, by contrast, lets you control how much money you'll get from your nest egg and when.</p>

<p>The upside of selling</p>

<p>And with investments you own outside of retirement accounts, taxes can differ. When you get a dividend, the entire amount is taxable; when you sell a stock or a fund, you pay taxes only on the increase in value over your purchase price. By cashing out shares with the smallest gains -- or ones with a capital loss -- you may be able to minimize or avoid that tax in some years. That's much harder to do with dividends.</p>

<p>Should Congress fail to extend the tax cuts scheduled to expire this year, this tax advantage could widen, as the current maximum 15% rate for qualified dividends would go to 39.6%, while the top rate for long-term capital gains would rise to just 20%.</p>

<p>The myth of safety</p>

<p>Another appeal of dividend payers is their perceived security. And it's true that the stocks typically hold up better when the market falls.</p>

<p>But the more you tilt your portfolio toward dividend-paying stocks, the less diverse it will be. Of the 3,696 stocks in the Wilshire 5000 stock index, only 40% pay a dividend. Right there, you've eliminated roughly 60% of U.S. stocks from consideration.</p>

<p>The stocks you end up owning will be largely concentrated in a few pockets of the market. In mid-2012, for example, Vanguard's Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) had more than 50% of assets in two sectors: industrials and consumer stocks.</p>

<p>"If you buy only high-yield stocks," says Dartmouth finance professor Kenneth French, "the sacrifice in diversification is huge."</p>

<p>This can be a problem if the sectors delivering the most yield get whacked. Which is exactly what happened during the financial crisis: Dividend ETFs that were heavily invested in financial stocks saw prices plummet by as much as 60% from 2007 to 2009.</p>

<p>I'm not predicting that dividend stocks will melt down as spectacularly again. But with investors flocking to them -- driving the P/E ratios of the highest-yielding stocks 25% to 30% above where they normally stand relative to the market -- they are vulnerable.</p>

<p>Rather than relying on dividends, take a more balanced approach. Start with a mix of stocks and bonds that gives you a reasonable tradeoff between growth and security -- say, 50% each. Then, using a total stock and a total bond market index fund as guides, make sure you are well diversified. Today, you'd collect about 2% in interest and dividends from that portfolio.</p>

<p>If you need to supplement that -- and you probably will -- do so by creating homemade dividends.</p>
