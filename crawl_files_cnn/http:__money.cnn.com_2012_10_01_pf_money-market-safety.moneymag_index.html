<p>Money-market mutual funds aren't insured by the FDIC.</p>

<p>(Money Magazine) -- An effort to increase the security and transparency of money-market mutual funds stalled in August when Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Mary Schapiro couldn't rally enough SEC support.</p>

<p>At issue: investors' belief that money funds, which aren't FDIC-insured, are risk-free.</p>

<p>To counter that perception, Schapiro wanted funds to disclose precise changes in their net asset value (NAV) per share; currently they all report $1, but that's because they're allowed to round to the nearest penny.</p>

<p>And to ensure each fund could handle a flood of investor withdrawals if its NAV fell below $1 -- in 2008 one money fund's NAV hit 97Â¢ -- Schapiro wanted funds to keep a cash cushion on hand.</p>

<p>Even without the proposed changes, it's money funds' "pitifully low" interest rates that should scare you nowadays, says Dallas adviser Charles Sizemore. Put your dough instead in a bank account, he says, where returns are similar and your money is insured.</p>
