<p>(Money Magazine) -- Robin Bylenga's working life hasn't always been a smooth ride.</p>

<p>Nine years ago, the then newly divorced mother of three young kids reentered the workforce and began honing a career in sales through a series of positions -- the most recent of which involved peddling L'Oréal hair products to beauty salons. While Bylenga liked the paycheck, the travel and long hours required took their toll.</p>

<p>Looking to unwind, she climbed on a bike for the first time in years. Something clicked. "I rode and rode and rode," Bylenga recalls.</p>

<p>When she was laid off from L'Oréal in 2009 after her division was sold, she decided to take an interim job at a local cycling store.</p>

<p>Within no time, she says, "women began to come in just to talk to me, and to ask questions like what trails were good with kids and what bra I wore when I rode."</p>

<p>The experience gave her the idea to create a bike-shopping experience for women that, as she says, wasn't all about how fast you rode or what scars you'd acquired. She imagined a boutique featuring feminine décor, stylish cycling apparel, and positive messages.</p>

<p>In December 2010, after a year of researching the market, Bylenga opened that store, called Pedal Chic, in downtown Greenville, S.C.</p>

<p>To drive traffic to the shop, she has hosted weekly group rides -- which are BYOBB, "bring your own beverage and bike" -- and offered maintenance classes called Women With Wrenches.</p>

<p>Last year, revenue hit $250,000. Based on sales so far, Bylenga expects to take in $500,000 in 2012 and reap her first profit.</p>

<p>She's also now paying herself $1,000 a month. While she could take more, she'd rather pump cash into growing Pedal Chic's e-commerce business.</p>

<p>Her next big goal is to expand, either by franchising or opening boutiques within larger retailers.</p>

<p>For now, though, she's happy with her return on investment. "Every time I help a customer find women to connect with through cycling," she says, "it's a payday."</p>

<p>HOW SHE DID IT</p>

<p>Profit she made on her trial run: 200% Before deciding to open a store, Bylenga wanted to make sure she could make a go of it. So she invested $500 in a small inventory of women's bike apparel to sell at a local bike race. After parlaying that into $1,500 in sales, she was convinced.</p>

<p>Amount she needed to start Pedal Chic: $50,000 The majority came from a five-year, 3.5% startup loan from Michelin Development. She also personally invested about $10,000. Together, the money allowed her to sign a lease, buy inventory, and hire five employees.</p>

<p>When Bylenga expects to match her previous pay of $60,000: 2014 In tandem with the child support she receives from her ex, her salary -- albeit small -- allows her to scrape by while reinvesting in the business. Because she's been in belt-tightening mode, she hasn't yet added to her savings but notes, "Pedal Chic is my retirement fund."</p>
