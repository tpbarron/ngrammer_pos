<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- In its latest retail strategy ahead of the holiday shopping season, Toys R Us will match its prices against competing retailers.</p>

<p>The retailer said that it will offer a "price match guarantee" on all items from Toys R Us or Babies R Us stores.</p>

<p>"Now through Christmas Eve, the company will match competitors' in-store pricing on identical items, any time a customer presents a local competitors' current, valid print advertisement showing the item available for less," said Toys R Us on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The retailer said the deal extends to include the seven days after the purchase at Toys R Us is made. Customers can get a "price adjustment" on their purchase if they see the items advertised for a lower price up to seven days after their purchase at Toys R Us.</p>

<p>This is the latest salvo that Toys R Us has launched against competing retailers like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT, Fortune 500), Target (TGT, Fortune 500), Macy's (M, Fortune 500), Kohl's (KSS, Fortune 500) and Sears (SHLD, Fortune 500).</p>

<p>Toys R Us recently announced a free layaway plan ahead of the holidays and a "hot toy reservation" offer. The free layaway offer runs through Oct. 31, after which the retailer will charge a $5 service fee. The hot toy offer allows customers to reserve certain toys with a 20% deposit.</p>

<p>Wal-Mart has also tried to make its layaway program more appealing to consumers, by reducing its upfront fee to $5 from $15. Wal-Mart also offers an "ad match" program, where it matches the lower prices advertised by local competitors.</p>

<p>Toys R Us also announced that it's ramping up holiday hiring this year, by hiring 45,000 seasonal workers. That's 5,000 more than last year.</p>

<p>Kohl's also announced plans to increase holiday hiring. The retailer will hire 52,700 seasonal workers, a 10% jump compared to last year.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Macy's is planning to hire 80,000 holiday workers to staff its Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores. That's an increase of 2,000 from last year.</p>

<p>Retailers are bracing for Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. It's one of the most important shopping days of the year, and a critical gauge of the consumer-driven economy</p>
