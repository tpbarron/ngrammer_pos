<p>"Bras are just the beginning," says entrepreneur Lam.</p>

<p>(Fortune) -- Last summer Michelle Lam spent two hours in the lingerie section of a San Francisco department store trying on "20 different bras, one after the other, in what seemed to be a random trial-and-error sequence," she recalls. She ended up leaving empty-handed, but the experience sparked an idea: an online bra store where women could find the perfect fit.</p>

<p>Lam, 33, is no fashionista, but she understands how to build a business. As an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers, a research associate at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and an associate at Parthenon Capital, she saw firsthand the different facets of how companies work. At BCG, she contributed research to a book featuring a Victoria's Secret case study. In 2007, Lam was made a principal at Bain Capital Ventures -- the first female principal in that arm of the firm. One of her early assignments was to evaluate LinkedIn's prospects as the startup raised its Series D funding. Beginning in 2010, Lam spent five months helping Rent the Runway -- a dress-rental website with fewer than 60 employees at the time -- structure its customer-acquisition plan.</p>

<p>In 2011, Lam left Bain, moving to California when her husband began a fellowship at the University of California at Berkeley. She took time off, developed an itch to start something new, and soon after found herself frustrated in that department store.</p>

<p>A friend set her up with Aarthi Ramamurthy, a 28-year-old former program manager at Microsoft. The two developed a personalized quiz based on the rules that experts use to fit customers without a tape measure. The co-founders hosted bra-fitting parties in Lam's living room. Over champagne and sushi, guests filled out quizzes and tried on bras based on their results. (A professional fitter was on hand with a tape measure to check against the quiz.) True & Co. released a beta version online in January 2012, and officially launched in May. In 36 hours some 20,000 women had signed up for its services.</p>

<p>Lam says she hopes to use technology to revamp a customer experience that has been "the same since the modern bra was invented in the mid-1930s." True & Co. has raised $2 million in seed money. Aileen Lee, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has invested, citing market potential (intimates are an estimated $9 billion market in the U.S.) and Lam's intensity.</p>

<p>Ready for launch</p>

<p>Risk career, not relationships. "You will always be employable," Lam says. Professionally, entrepreneurialism will only help. The real risk is not your career, she cautions, but personal relationships.</p>

<p>Don 't listen to everyone. Negative reviews are inevitable. "Listen to those who support you," Lam says.</p>

<p>Downsize. She and her husband downsized after leaving their venture capital jobs. "Before you take the leap, make a budget," Lam advises.</p>
