<p>Dow Chemicals says it will cut 5% of its global workforce.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Dow Chemical announced Tuesday that it is cutting 2,400 jobs, citing slow economic growth in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The company is closing roughly 20 plants, including facilities in Michigan and Ohio as well as several in Europe. It expects to save $500 million annually as a result by the end of 2014. By reducing its capital spending and investments, it will save a further $500 million.</p>

<p>The 2,400 layoffs amount to 5% of Dow Chemical's (DOW, Fortune 500) global work force.</p>

<p>"The reality is we are operating in a slow-growth environment in the near-term and, while these actions are difficult, they demonstrate our resolve to tightly manage operations -- particularly in Europe -- and mitigate the impact of current market dynamics," Dow CEO Andrew Liveris said in a statement.</p>
