<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Chemical company DuPont announced Tuesday it would cut about 1,500 jobs worldwide, or about 2% of its global work force.</p>

<p>The company said it will make the cuts over the next 12 to 18 months as part of an effort to trim costs by $450 million. But the cost-cutting effort resulted in $342 million in after-tax charges in the most recent quarter.</p>

<p>DuPont disclosed its plans as it reported a larger-than-expected drop in operating earnings in the third quarter. It also lowered its earnings guidance for this year, warning that its income would be down for the period.</p>
