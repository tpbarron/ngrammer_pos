<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A year after graduating from college, women are earning thousands of dollars less per year than their male peers.</p>

<p>Women who worked full-time jobs one year after receiving their diplomas earned 82 cents for every dollar men earned. That's according to a report from the American Association of University Women, which analyzed data from a Department of Education survey of 15,000 graduates conducted in 2009, the most recent data available.</p>

<p>While men earned average salaries of $42,918, women earned $35,296 -- a nearly $8,000 difference, the report found.</p>

<p>"You hear in the news that [millennial] women are now out-earning their male peers, but what we found in looking at those emerging from college is that there is still a gender pay gap," said Catherine Hill, director of research at AAUW.</p>

<p>Why the gap? Men typically choose majors that result in more lucrative careers post-graduation, like engineering. Even if men and women major in the same subject, men tend to end up in higher-paying jobs. Men also work more hours, according to AAUW.</p>

<p>But even when controlling for these factors -- by looking at men and women with the same majors, jobs and hours -- women were still paid 7% less than men.</p>

<p>Female business majors, for example, earned a little over $38,000, while men earned more than $45,000. Among men and women who took teaching jobs, women earned 89% of what men earned. And while men reported working 45 hours a week compared to the 43 hours reported by women, among those who said they work 40 hours a week, women earned 84% of what men earned (across all jobs).</p>

<p>Other less measurable factors may also be at play, such as gender discrimination and willingness to negotiate salary, which studies have shown men are more likely to do.</p>

<p>Debt piles up for female grads: Thanks to this pay gap, women are spending a much bigger share of their earnings on monthly student loan payments.</p>

<p>While women and men borrowed similar amounts of money to fund their education, nearly half of women were paying more than 8% of their earnings toward student loan debt in 2009. Less than 40% of men were paying the same amount.</p>

<p>The AAUW estimates that based on pay, it's unmanageable for women to spend more than 7.8% of their earnings on student loan debt. Yet, 53% of women paid more than this. Meanwhile, 39% of men paid more than the 8.9% threshold that AAUW says is affordable for men.</p>

<p>"It's shocking that these numbers are as high as they are, and it suggests to us that student debt continues to grow but we're not seeing the same increases in wages -- and women's wages in particular are not keeping pace," said Hill.</p>
