<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple on Tuesday unveiled a smaller iPad, dubbed the iPad mini, at a highly anticipated event in San Jose, Calif.</p>

<p>The device, which has a 7.9-inch screen, is one-third smaller overall than than its 10-inch cousin and weighs less than a pound. It's also 23% thinner than the full-sized iPad.</p>

<p>The iPad mini will hit stores on Nov. 2, starting at $329 for the 16-gigabyte, Wi-Fi only version. Larger 32 GB and 64 GB versions will cost $429 and $529, respectively. Apple will begin taking pre-orders on Friday.</p>

<p>Like the full-size iPad, the iPad mini has versions that connect with 3G and 4G cellular networks from Verizon (VZ, Fortune 500), AT&T (T, Fortune 500) or Sprint (S, Fortune 500). The cellular iterations, which will ship in mid-November, will cost $459, $559 and $659.</p>

<p>Apple boasted that the iPad mini weighs less than most rival seven-inch tablets, including the Amazon Kindle Fire and Google Nexus 7, but features a 35% larger screen than those competitors. It also comes with a 5 megapixel rear "iSight" camera and a high-definition, front-facing camera for FaceTime video chats.</p>

<p>The iPad mini will run Apple's new iOS 6 software, complete with Siri and all of the other features available on the iPhone and larger iPad. The mini iPad has the same 10-hour battery life as its bigger relative and the same screen resolution as the still-available, year-old iPad 2. It also features Apple's new Lightning connector and a smaller "smart" cover.</p>

<p>Apple also unveiled a slightly updated fourth-generation traditional iPad at its event, with a new, twice-as-fast processor and U.S. 4G-LTE coverage. The new iPad comes with Apple's Lightning connector. Previous versions featured the significantly larger 30-pin connector that Apple has used since 2003.</p>

<p>Apple's 9.7-inch iPad lineup starts at $399 for the iPad 2 and $499 for the fourth-generation iPad.</p>

<p>Shares of Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) were down almost 2% shortly after the event.</p>

<p>Since the iPad debuted in 2010, no tablet challenger has come close to unseating it. Apple held a 70% share of the tablet market in the second quarter, according to the latest data from IHS iSuppli.</p>

<p>Amazon's (AMZN, Fortune 500) Kindle Fire HD and Google's (GOOG, Fortune 500) Nexus 7 both come with seven-inch screens and $199 price tags. Though they haven't threatened the iPad's dominance in the tablet market, they have sold well enough to get Apple's attention.</p>

<p>Apple could potentially stomp out the competition with a lower-cost, smaller tablet of its own.</p>

<p>Ahead of the announcement, Wall Street analysts predicted that the iPad mini would keep small tablet competition at bay. Even though the iPad mini is considerably pricier than small-tablet rivals, industry analysts expect that it will vastly outsell its competitors.</p>

<p>"The iPad mini is the competitions' worst nightmare," said Shaw Wu, analyst at Sterne Agee. "Competitors are already having a tough time competing against the $399 iPad 2 and $499 iPad, and we believe lower price point iPads will make it even more difficult."</p>

<p>Apple's announcement comes ahead of another big tablet launch this week: Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) will be releasing its Surface tablet on Oct. 26 -- the first tablet of its own design.</p>

<p>Macintosh: Before showing off the iPad mini, the company also unveiled a new lineup of Macintosh computers, including a 20% thinner and one-pound lighter 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display. The company also updated the $599 Mac Mini.</p>

<p>The most impressive new Mac is the iMac all-in-one computer, which comes with a 45% thinner display and is a remarkable 80% thinner at the edge. That makes the computer eight pounds lighter.</p>

<p>The new iMac has an option for a new "Fusion Drive," which combines flash and hard drive storage for faster reading and writing.</p>

<p>Apple also introduced a new iBooks app for the iPad and iPhone, with continuous scrolling (no more "flipping" through pages), and new sharing options.</p>
