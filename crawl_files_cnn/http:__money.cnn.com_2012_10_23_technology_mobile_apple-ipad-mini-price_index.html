<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple finally unveiled its worst-kept secret, the iPad Mini tablet, on Tuesday. The teeny device starts at $329, which leaves some breathing room for rivals' cheaper 7-inch devices.</p>

<p>The iPad Mini announcement came months after the debut of $199 7-inch tablets from Amazon (AMZN, Fortune 500), Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) and Samsung. Amazon's cheapest offering, the Kindle Fire, starts at $159.</p>

<p>Those three rivals went for the jugular by undercutting Apple's original $499 iPad on price -- effectively giving customers an option between low-end and high-end tablets. Tech analysts were watching closely to see if Apple would aggressively go after the competition with a much cheaper iPad.</p>

<p>Apple shares were down about 2% after the announcement, while Amazon and Google were up slightly. Barnes & Noble (BKS, Fortune 500), which recently released its $199 Nook HD, gained more than 6%.</p>

<p>Before the iPad Mini announcement, analysts' guesses on the tablet's price were all over the map, generally ranging from $249 to $349. And they're split on what Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) hopes to achieve with the Mini, which features a 7.9-inch screen. (The traditional iPad clocks in at nearly 10 inches.)</p>

<p>"We see this as Apple playing both defense and offense," said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee. "They're defending against 7-inch tablets from its competitors, plus going after even more potential PC buyers who instead opt for tablets."</p>

<p>Wu had expected the iPad Mini to cost between $299 and $349.</p>

<p>The $329 price for the iPad Mini is well above the low end of a target range from Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore, who said one day before the announcement that a $250 price tag would "be a barnburner, especially during this holiday season." Still, he thinks the $250-$350 price point is an "underserved market segment."</p>

<p>Projections from a group of JPMorgan analysts sorely missed; they predicted on Monday that the iPad Mini would start at $249. The group waved off concerns about margins and possible competition with the iPod Touch, saying Apple's "overarching focus" is on grabbing a bigger share of the overall tablet market.</p>

<p>The teeny iPad will appeal to "more price-sensitive users and the e-reader crowd," the JPMorgan analysts wrote on Monday. They specifically credited Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7 with creating interest in "smaller-form-factor tablets."</p>

<p>Amazon and Google might have cut the price of their tablets if the iPad Mini were cheaper. But now it's not clear if they will need to do so.</p>

<p>Laura DiDio, principal analyst at research firm ITIC, told CNNMoney in a recent interview that an iPad Mini price of $249 or higher would allow competitors to keep their 7-inch tablets at $199. But if Apple had come closer to the $199 price point, Amazon -- the most price-conscious competitor -- could have been forced to drop its Kindle Fire price by $50 or more.</p>
