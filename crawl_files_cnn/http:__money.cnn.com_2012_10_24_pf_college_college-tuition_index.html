<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A growing number of colleges are joining the once-elite club of schools charging more than $50,000 per year.</p>

<p>For the 2012-13 academic year, 151 colleges charged annual tuition, fees, room and board totaling more than $50,000, according to College Board data analyzed by the Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>

<p>That's up from 123 schools last year, 100 schools the year before and only 58 schools the year before that.</p>

<p>One college even priced out of the $50,000 range this year, charging more than $60,000.

<p>Selective liberal arts colleges like Wesleyan University, Vassar College, Williams College and Bowdoin College were among the most expensive schools, as were Ivy Leagues like Harvard University, Stanford University and Dartmouth College.</p>
