<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Can I skip investing in stocks altogether during retirement if I have saved a lot? -- Andrew C., Florida</p>

<p>After seeing stocks plummet almost 60% between late 2007 and early 2009, I understand why you may want to avoid them. And you can, as long as you're able to live comfortably on a very low withdrawal rate.</p>

<p>With a 100% bond portfolio, taking out 3% of your portfolio's value initially and then adjusting that amount annually for inflation would leave you with roughly an 80% chance of your money lasting 30 years.</p>

<p>But is such a low withdrawal rate realistic? For most retirees, I think not. And once you start taking out more -- even going from 3% to 4% -- avoiding stocks reduces your return potential so much that it leaves you vulnerable to running out of dough early.</p>

<p>That said, you don't have to go overboard. Invest half your savings in stocks and half in bonds -- close to what 401(k) participants in their 60s do on average, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute -- and you have just under an 80% chance of your portfolio lasting at least 30 years, assuming a 4% withdrawal plan. Even if you reduce your stocks to 30% of your portfolio, that probability falls to just 70%.</p>

<p>So why go with anything more than the absolute lowest amount of stocks necessary? Leaning a bit more toward equities may enhance your financial security in other ways.</p>

<p>One benefit is that stocks can help you maintain a higher balance in your retirement accounts than a more conservative mix would (see graphic above).</p>

<p>Having a cushion as you enter your later years can provide a margin of safety in case you run into higher-than-expected health care costs or other unanticipated expenses.</p>

<p>What's more, in the event your spending creeps up, a more stock-heavy portfolio may be better able to absorb the higher outlays. Boosting your withdrawals with a more conservative mix is far more likely to send your nest egg to an early demise.</p>

<p>You've also got to consider your own circumstances. With few resources beyond your investments -- no pension or little home equity -- you may want to opt for a less aggressive mix. Just remember the price for playing it too safe.</p>
