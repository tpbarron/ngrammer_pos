<p>Marissa Mayer touted her newest purchase, Stamped, on her Instagram account.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Yahoo has acquired its first company under the leadership of new CEO Marissa Mayer: Stamped, a New York startup backed by a roster of celebrity investors, including Ryan Seacrest and Justin Bieber.</p>

<p>Launched just over a year ago, Stamped created a mobile recommendations platform that allowed customers to "stamp" everything from a favorite restaurant to a beloved song.</p>

<p>Yahoo (YHOO, Fortune 500) isn't keeping the product, though. It will shut down by the end of the deal, Stamped's founders wrote Thursday in a message announcing the deal.</p>

<p>The deal was strictly a talent acquisition. Stamped's nine employees all plan to join Yahoo and will head a New York-based engineering and product team.</p>

<p>"After everything we learned from building Stamped, we're excited to start work again on something big, mobile, and new," the founders wrote.</p>

<p>The deal fits with the mobile-first strategy Mayer laid out earlier this week on Yahoo's quarterly earnings call. Yahoo "hasn't capitalized on the mobile opportunity," she said, calling it Yahoo's new "top priority."</p>

<p>The price of the acquisition was not disclosed. A source close to the company says Stamped had more than one offer on the table and chose Yahoo because of the team's past experience with Mayer.</p>

<p>"As a team of mostly former Googlers, we've all worked with and are big fans of Marissa," Stamped's founders wrote on their website. "So when an opportunity arose to become a part of the team at Yahoo, we jumped."</p>

<p>The crew is already looking to hire additional engineers and designers to expand Yahoo's New York presence.</p>
