<p>Paul Ceglia is charged with one count of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud, each of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Federal agents arrested Paul Ceglia, an upstate New York man who claims he's owed 50% of Facebook, Friday morning on charges of perpetuating a "multi-billion-dollar scheme" to defraud the company. If convicted, Ceglia faces up to 40 years in prison.</p>

<p>The move could end a bizarre legal saga that began in July 2010, when Ceglia filed suit in New York claiming that he paid Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to build a website similar to what became Facebook, and that they agreed to split the company. Both Facebook (FB) and founder Mark Zuckerberg have strenuously denied Ceglia's claims.</p>

<p>The government's complaint against Ceglia, 39, echoes Facebook's accusations. Ceglia "doctored, fabricated, and destroyed evidence to support his false claim," according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in New York City.</p>

<p>The government's complaint accuses Ceglia of altering a contract and inventing emails that didn't exist.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg acknowledged signing a business contract in 2003 with Ceglia for a small programing job, one of many work-for-hire gigs that Zuckerberg accepted as a college student. But Facebook says that contact predated Facebook, which was conceived in 2004, and made no mention of the social networking venture.</p>

<p>The government's investigators agree. The real contract, discovered on one of Ceglia's hard drives, and "does not refer to Facebook in any fashion," according to the U.S. attorney's office.</p>

<p>A search of email servers at Harvard University, where Zuckerberg was a student at the time in question, did not turn up alleged emails that Ceglia submitted as evidence.</p>

<p>Ceglia is charged with one count of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud, each of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>Federal agents arrested Ceglia Friday at his home in Wellsville, N.Y., about 90 miles south of Buffalo.</p>

<p>Ceglia's attorneys did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The U.S. Attorney's office said he will appear at federal court in Buffalo later on Friday.</p>

<p>Orin Snyder, a lawyer at the firm Gibson Dunn who is representing Facebook and Zuckerberg, said they "commend" the U.S. Attorney's office for bringing charges against Ceglia.</p>

<p>"Ceglia used the federal court system to perpetuate his fraud and will now be held accountable for his criminal scheme," Snyder said in a prepared statement. Facebook did not comment further on the charges.</p>

<p>When Ceglia filed his charges in mid-2010, Facebook was caught off guard. A state court in New York's Allegany County, where the case originated, briefly froze the company's assets, while Facebook's lawyers scrambled to untangle Ceglia's claims and Zuckerberg's pre-Facebook business dealings.</p>

<p>Back in April 2003, Ceglia arranged to pay Zuckerberg for development work on a now-defunct site called StreetFax. Ceglia claimed the deal also covered work on a fledgling site called "the Face Book" and produced a contract to back his claim.</p>

<p>Government investigators say Ceglia "simply replaced page one of the real contract with a new page one doctored to make it appear as though Zuckerberg had agreed to provide Ceglia with an interest in Facebook."</p>

<p>Ceglia's lawsuit got a fresh round of attention when he re-filed it in April 2011 with the backing of high-profile law firm DLA Piper (which dropped the case a few months later). The new documents included dozens of incendiary e-mails allegedly exchanged between Ceglia and Zuckerberg from July 2003 and July 2004 -- an email trail that the government says was entirely faked.</p>

<p>Ceglia has had several brushes with the law, including a 1997 felony conviction for possession of 400 grams of a compound found in certain hallucinogenic mushrooms. In 2009, Ceglia was convicted of fraud in connection with a wood pellet company he owned.</p>
