<p>Amazon's Kindle Fire is sold virtually at cost.</p>

<p>(Money Magazine) -- Ever since it was founded in 1994, Amazon.com has been all about transformation.</p>

<p>The Seattle-based online retailer started off by reinventing the way books were sold. Then it redefined itself by hawking everything from furniture to electronics -- in the process challenging giant retailers such as Wal-Mart head-on.</p>

<p>More recently, the company doubled down on its dotcom roots through tablets, streaming video, and cloud computing. Transformation, though, comes at a steep price.</p>

<p>Can Amazon (AMZN, Fortune 500) afford to keep being so daring?</p>

<p>Tech 2.0</p>

<p>Amazon is re-embracing its inner nerd. The company struck a blow against Netflix by signing an agreement with Epix, giving Amazon Prime subscribers access to thousands of additional streaming videos.</p>

<p>EC2, the firm's cloud-computing unit, leads Google and Microsoft in market share. And with the Kindle Fire, which controls 22% of the U.S. tablet market, Amazon is taking direct aim at the iPad and Apple's iTunes platform.</p>

<p>The stock is already reaping benefits -- investors are valuing it like an Internet startup circa 1999.</p>

<p>Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy says, "Amazon's P/E shouldn't scare investors off because its profitability is still being sacrificed for investments in rapid expansion." Of course, you've probably heard that one before.</p>

<p>Reinventing retail</p>

<p>The e-tailer, which accounts for almost 2% of retail industry sales, is growing rapidly and poses a threat to traditional big-box stores. To keep up with the company's expansion, Amazon is building 18 new fulfillment centers, which will further speed up delivery times.</p>

<p>"Amazon is already testing out pilot programs in certain cities which would allow for same-day delivery service," says Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer. "If successful, the online behemoth could pose an even greater threat to brick-and-mortar stores."</p>

<p>The threat could be slightly muted, though, by new laws forcing Amazon to collect sales tax on behalf of states where it previously hadn't, shrinking the online seller's price advantage.</p>

<p>Big sales, little profits</p>

<p>While revenues are thriving, reaching $48 billion last year, profits have seen better days, as the company is in spending mode.</p>

<p>Amazon recently paid $775 million for Kiva Systems, makers of warehouse robots. That followed last year's acquisition of U.K.- based LOVEFiLM to help compete against Netflix (NFLX) globally.</p>

<p>And in an effort to gain market share, Amazon's new Kindle Fire 2 will be sold virtually at cost.</p>

<p>"Amazon isn't trying to make money on hardware," says Morningstar's Hottovy. "It's using devices to lure consumers into spending more on e-books, digital content, and Prime subscriptions."</p>

<p>The strategy is a gamble: Wal-Mart (WMT, Fortune 500) and Target (TGT, Fortune 500) have stopped selling Kindles for competitive reasons, potentially slowing Amazon's plans.</p>
