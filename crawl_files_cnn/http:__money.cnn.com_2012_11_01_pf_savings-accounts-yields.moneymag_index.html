<p>The Federal Reserve is targeting unemployment.</p>

<p>(Money Magazine) -- Waiting for higher yields on savings? Don't hold your breath.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve said in September it would buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month until the labor market rebounds. The goal: to free up banks to lend more.</p>

<p>It's the Fed's third attempt since 2008 to use this tactic, called quantitative easing.</p>

<p>Targeting the 8%-plus jobless rate, QE3, as it's known, is likely to hold down mortgage rates which in October hit a 60-year low of 3.36%.</p>

<p>The Fed also plans to keep short-term rates near zero through mid-2015, so get used to current savings yields (recently averaging 0.12%).</p>

<p>And if you're looking to beef up bond fund income, Morningstar Investment Management economist Francisco Torralba suggests short-term corporates, which yield about 2% today. Though the risk of inflation is low, he says, a spike would hit higher-yielding long-term bonds harder.</p>
