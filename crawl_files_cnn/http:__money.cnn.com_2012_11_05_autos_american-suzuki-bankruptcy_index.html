<p>Suzuki was facing multiple challenges in the U.S., including unfavorable currency exchange rates.</p>

<p>HONG KONG (CNNMoney) -- Japan-based Suzuki said Tuesday that it was closing its American auto distributor and exiting the U.S. car market.</p>

<p>The company's U.S. arm, American Suzuki Motor Corp., will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in California. The company said it would wind down auto sales, but did not provide a timetable.</p>

<p>American Suzuki said it would honor all warranties, and indicated that parts and service should continue uninterrupted.</p>

<p>The automaker was facing multiple challenges in the United States, including unfavorable exchange rates and a small lineup of models. The company, which managed to capture only a tiny sliver of the U.S. market, also cited slow sales as a reason for the exit.</p>

<p>"While the decision to discontinue new automobile sales in the U.S. was difficult to make, today's actions were inevitable under these circumstances," the company said.</p>

<p>The brand is perhaps best known for its Sidekick SUV, a pioneering design later followed by other automakers. American Suzuki is $346 million in debt, $173 million of which is owed to the parent company. The distributor has between 500 and 1,000 creditors, according to court documents.</p>

<p>American Suzuki said it plans to emerge from bankruptcy as a company focused on selling ATVs, motorcycles and outboard marine engines. The company said it remains "firmly committed" to those product lines.</p>

<p>"These divisions are competitively positioned in their respective markets, allowing for long-term growth as economic conditions improve," the company said.</p>

<p>American Suzuki -- based in Brea, Calif. -- had 365 employees as of last count.</p>
