<p>The Hot Wheels Chevrolet Camaro will feature classic Hot Wheels-style "Red Line" wheels.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Whenever I'm in the drugstore, I still stop by the aisle where new Hot Wheels cars hang in their blister packs to see what's new there. If there's one I like, I buy it -- for myself.</p>

<p>My wife does not understand this. Why in the world, when as a automobile writer I get to drive real Bentleys, Shelbys and Aston Martins, would I want to take home a tiny toy version of the same car? Well, for one thing, I have to return the loaners but I get to keep the toy.</p>

<p>And I'm not the only grownup who likes toy cars. Mattel (MAT, Fortune 500) doesn't have a firm number on this, but it's undeniable that a significant percentage of Hot Wheels collectors are of legal driving age.</p>

<p>That's one reason Mattel's Hot Wheels division teamed up with General Motors (GM, Fortune 500) to create a special Hot Wheels version of the Chevrolet Camaro.</p>

<p>The special edition car, revealed at a custom car trade show recently, will only be available for a limited time and will cost about $7,000 more than a standard-issue Camaro.</p>

<p>The two brands originally generated interest in a Hot Wheels Camaro with a gleaming green concept car displayed at car shows around the country last year. But this just announced car doesn't look much like that green machine. The show car's mirror-like green finish was deemed too expensive and difficult to maintain for use on a production car.</p>

<p>Instead, this car gets a metallic blue paint job with a matte black stripe that stretches from nose to tail. In addition, a "blue flame" Hot Wheels decal adorns the rear fender and there's a red stripe around the outside of the car's 21-inch wheels. The red line on the wheels -- the biggest wheels ever offered on a Camaro -- mimics the red line on the wheels of early Hot Wheels cars from the 1960s and '70s.</p>

<p>The special edition Camaro also has a grille and spoiler like those on the high-performance Camaro ZL1. But the Hot Wheels Camaro doesn't include any performance upgrades.</p>

<p>If you're thinking this car could be a future collectible, Phil Skinner, collector car market senior editor for Kelley Blue Book, said, "maybe." In the short term, special edition packages like this one -- ones that don't involve any performance upgrades -- do nothing at all for a vehicle's value on the used car market.</p>

<p>But 25 to 30 years later, assuming the car's been kept in good condition, this car could be worth as much as 25% more than a run-of-the-mill 2013 Camaro will be.</p>

<p>The idea for a Hot Wheels car came up during a routine meeting between Hot Wheels representatives and GM, said Felix Holst, creative vice president for Mattel's Wheels division.</p>

<p>"In that discussion, one of our marketing guys had the audacity to suggest we should do a full size production car," he said.</p>

<p>The idea generated enormous excitement. It resulted in, first, the shiny green concept car and now this blue limited edition production car, he said.</p>

<p>Dealers are taking orders now and GM will produce the Hot Wheels Camaro from January until the 2014 Camaro goes into production in June, GM spokesman Monte Doran said.</p>

<p>Hot Wheels will also sell its own 1/64 scale version of the new Camaro. I'll be looking for that one at the drugstore.</p>
