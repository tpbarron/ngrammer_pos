<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- U.S. stocks sank Thursday, adding to the previous day's sharp declines, as investors continue to worry that political gridlock in Washington will drive the economy off the fiscal cliff.</p>

<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.9% to its lowest close since late July. The S&P 500 declined 1.2%, while the Nasdaq shed 1.4%. The retreat comes after stocks tumbled 2% on Wednesday, with the Dow suffering its worst one-day drop of the year.</p>

<p>Financial stocks, which led the post-election decline, regained some ground. Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500) shares rose 2%, making the stock the best performer on the Dow.</p>

<p>Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) shares fell deeper into bear market territory -- down more than 20% from their all-time-high of $705 hit in mid-September. The widely-held stock weighs heavily on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.</p>

<p>Following President Obama's re-election Tuesday night, attention has shifted to how lawmakers will address the looming fiscal cliff that threatens to throw the country back into a recession.</p>

<p>Investors remain focused on the debate in Washington over billions of dollars in taxes and spending cuts that are set to kick in automatically on Jan. 1, said Peter Cardillo, market strategist at Rockwell Global Capital. While he expects Obama and Congress to hammer out a solution before the deadline, "it's going to be touch and go for the market in the short run."</p>

<p>Stocks were up modestly in the morning, but selling quickly took over. There was no particular driver behind the afternoon retreat, said Dan Greenhaus, market strategist at broker-dealer BTIG. The fiscal cliff, he added, "is the only thing that matters."</p>

<p>Those fears overshadowed upbeat economic reports.</p>

<p>The government said 355,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment claims in the latest week, down from a week earlier.</p>

<p>The trade deficit for September narrowed to $41.5 billion. Analysts were expecting the gap to widen to $45.4 billion.</p>

<p>Thursday's data "bodes well for an acceleration of economic activity," said Cardillo.</p>

<p>After the market closed, online travel company Kayak (KYAK) announced plans to be acquired by Priceline (PCLN) for $40 a share in cash and stock.</p>

<p>Shares of Groupon (GRPN) fell 13% in extended trading after the daily deals website reported a net loss for the quarter.</p>

<p>Disney (DIS, Fortune 500) reported quarterly and full-year earnings that matched analysts' expectations.</p>

<p>Before the market opened, Wendy's (WEN) reported weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. But the fast-food chain said same-store sales, a key measure of growth, increased for a sixth quarter in a row, sending shares up 2.5%. McDonald's (MCD, Fortune 500)shares fell after the fast food chain said same-store sales declined 1.8% in October.</p>

<p>Dean Foods (DF, Fortune 500) shares rose after the company posted a strong profit and said its CFO Shaun Mara is stepping down. Mara will be replaced by Chris Bellairs, who is currently CFO of the company's Fresh Dairy Direct division.</p>
