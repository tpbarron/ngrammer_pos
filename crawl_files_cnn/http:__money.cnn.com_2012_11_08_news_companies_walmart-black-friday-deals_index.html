<p>Wal-Mart disclosed its Black Friday deals -- which actually will be available beginning at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Wal-Mart wants you to forget Black Friday this year. Instead, the store is kicking off some of its hottest "Black Friday" deals on Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, beginning at 8 p.m.</p>

<p>The retailer says its best deals will be on electronics, tablets, TVs, gaming consoles, home appliances and toys. Last year, Wal-Mart rolled out its Black Friday deals at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. This year is the earliest that Wal-Mart (WMT, Fortune 500), the world's largest retailer, has ever jumpstarted its holiday sales bonanza.</p>

<p>Duncan MacNaughton, Wal-Mart's chief merchandising officer, said the decision was based on customer feedback. "Our customers told us they wanted to shop earlier this year, and go to bed earlier," he said.</p>

<p>MacNaughton also promised that Wal-Mart's Black Friday deals will be "some of the most aggressive" the retailer has ever had.</p>

<p>Wal-Mart is rolling out the discounts in three stages.</p>

<p>Phase 1: Beginning at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving, the best in-store deals are on toys, games, home goods and clothing. These include Xbox 360 4GB with SkyLanders bundle for $149; Nintendo's Wii console for $89; a Crock Pot 6-quart slow cooker and Mr. Coffee programmable 12-cup coffee maker for $9.44 each; DVD and Blu-ray movies for $1.96 to $9.96 each; video games for $10 to $25 each; Barbie, Bratz and Disney Princess dolls for $5 each.</p>

<p>Between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., Wal-Mart is also guaranteeing that customers who are already waiting in line inside the store will be able to buy three special deals -- Apple iPad2 16GB with Wi-Fi for $399 plus get a $75 Walmart gift card; EmersonÂ®32" 720p LCD TV for $148 and LG Blu-ray Player for $38. MacNaughton said the Wal-Mart is offering that guarantee because it has enough inventory of those three products to meet the anticipated demand.</p>
