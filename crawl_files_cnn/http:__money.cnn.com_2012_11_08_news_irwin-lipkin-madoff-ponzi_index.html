<p>Bernie Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence.</p>

<p>HONG KONG (CNNMoney) -- Irwin Lipkin, the former controller of Bernie Madoff's investment company, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to falsifying documents and conspiring to commit securities fraud.</p>

<p>Preet Bharara, the Manhattan district attorney, described Lipkin in a statement as a "loyal foot soldier" to Madoff, his long-time employer.</p>

<p>The guilty plea covers charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, to falsify records and to make false filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

<p>"By his own admission, Irwin Lipkin aided and abetted Bernard Madoff in his colossal Ponzi scheme for more than two decades," FBI Acting Assistant Director-In-Charge Mary Galligan said in a statement. "He regularly and routinely cooked the books, a recipe for concealing the largest investment fraud in history."</p>

<p>With the two-count guilty plea, Lipkin joins a growing list of Madoff associates facing long jail sentences.</p>

<p>Madoff's brother Peter, who worked at the firm with him, recently pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and falsifying investment records.</p>

<p>And in October, federal prosecutors filed new charges against five additional Madoff employees, saying that his massive scheme to defraud investors started in the 1970s, much earlier than previously alleged.</p>

<p>Last year, Lipkin's son Eric, who also worked for Madoff, pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy, fraud and making false statements.</p>

<p>Madoff pleaded guilty in March 2009 to orchestrating the largest Ponzi scheme in history, cheating thousands of victims out of billions of dollars. He is currently serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in North Carolina.</p>
