<p>Now borrowers who hold mortgages backed by Fannie (FNMA, Fortune 500) or Freddie (FMCC, Fortune 500)who live in federally declared disaster areas as a result of the storm will get automatic 90-day suspensions on foreclosure sales and evictions. The suspensions will be "immediate and mandatory" in areas where federal assistance is being made available to individual homeowners.</p>

<p>In addition, the two mortgage giants, which back about 70% of all U.S. home loans, expanded on the relief efforts they announced days after the storm. Loan servicers can now offer 90-day postponements of mortgage payments much more quickly to storm victims by offering them over the phone and they can also extend that forbearance by up to 12 months, without having to consult Fannie and Freddie.</p>

<p>Fannie and Freddie will also maintain pricing for mortgage applicants whose purchases were delayed. As a result, borrowers won't have to worry about paying more in fees because they could not close on schedule as a result of Sandy.</p>
