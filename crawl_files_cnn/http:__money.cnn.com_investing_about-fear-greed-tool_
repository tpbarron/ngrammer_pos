<p>Investors are driven by two emotions: fear and greed. Too much fear can sink stocks well below where they should be. When investors get greedy, they can bid up stock prices way too far.</p>

<p>So what emotion is driving the market now? CNNMoney's Fear & Greed index makes it clear.</p>

<p>We look at 7 indicators:</p>

<p>•Stock Price Momentum: The S&P 500 (SPX) versus its 125-day moving average</p>

<p>•Stock Price Strength: The number of stocks hitting 52-week highs and lows on the New York Stock Exchange</p>

<p>•Stock Price Breadth: The volume of shares trading in stocks on the rise versus those declining.</p>

<p>•Put and Call Options: The put/call ratio, which compares the trading volume of bullish call options relative to the trading volume of bearish put options</p>

<p>•Junk Bond Demand: The spread between yields on investment grade bonds and junk bonds</p>

<p>•Market Volatility: The VIX (VIX), which measures volatility</p>

<p>•Safe Haven Demand: The difference in returns for stocks versus Treasuries</p>

<p>For each indicator, we look at how far they've veered from their average relative to how far they normally veer. We look at each on a scale from 0 - 100. The higher the reading, the greedier investors are being, and 50 is neutral.</p>

<p>Then we put all the indicators together - equally weighted - for a final index reading.</p>

<p>When the S&P 500 (SPX) plummeted to a three-year low on Sept. 17, 2008 - the height of the financial crisis -- the Fear and Greed index sank to 12. The index gained some ground to 28 before stocks finally bottomed out on March 9, 2009 and the latest bull market began.</p>

<p>Most recently, in the first quarter of 2012, stocks staged their best run in decades, and the index showed pure greed.</p>
