<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Not all community colleges are created equal. Figuring out which school will give you the best chance of transferring to a four-year college or university can be difficult, especially since there is so little standardized information out there.</p>

<p>But here's a good way to start. College Measures, a joint venture of the American Institutes of Research and Matrix Knowledge Group, has created a chart for CNNMoney to help students find the best options. Based on the percentage of students that graduated within three years or transferred to four-year colleges, they compiled a "success" rating for each community college in the U.S.</p>

<p>To make sure a school did not appear on this list because of a statistical blip, we did not count colleges with less than 200 full-time freshmen. You can sort the data below by college name, city, state or success rating by clicking on the column heading.</p>

<p>Don't see your school? You can find a breakdown of each community college's graduation and transfer rates separately at Collegemeasures.org or the National Center for Education Statistics' College Navigator.</p>
