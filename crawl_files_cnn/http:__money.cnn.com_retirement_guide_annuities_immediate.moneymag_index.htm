<p>Immediate annuities (sometimes called income or payout annuities), are pretty straightforward - basically a mirror image of a life insurance policy. Instead of paying regular premiums to an insurer that makes a lump-sum payment upon your death, with an annuity you give the insurer a lump sum of cash in return for regular income payments until you die. (Actually, you have several options, including payments for a specified period of time - say, 10 or 20 years - or payments that will continue for as long as you or your spouse is alive.)</p>

<p>As the name suggests, immediate annuities start paying out right away, so they're are frequently used by people already in retirement. A deferred annuity can also be converted into an immediate annuity.</p>
