<p>If you find yourself running short on time - say, you're in your 40s or even your 50s, and you haven't gotten started yet - there are still a few things you can do. The key is to do them now.</p>

<p>You should first max out your contributions to tax-favored retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. For 2012, the IRS allows $17,000 for a 401(k) (though your employer may impose lower limits), and $5,000 for traditional and Roth IRAs. If you're over 50, you can contribute additional catch-up contributions. Even the government understands that this is crunch time, and it has devised a few ways to help you out.</p>

<p>For example, workers age 50 and older can put more money into IRAs and workplace retirement plans than younger savers can. That means you can and should contribute an additional $5,500 to a 401(k) and $1,000 to traditional and Roth IRAs.</p>

<p>If you're arriving late to retirement planning, a traditional IRA may be a better choice than a Roth.</p>
