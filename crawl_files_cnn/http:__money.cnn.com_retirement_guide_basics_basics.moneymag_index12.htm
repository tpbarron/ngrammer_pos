<p>Trying to figure out whether you can afford to retire is like putting together pieces of a financial jigsaw puzzle. First, you need to estimate how much you'll spend in retirement. Then you must consider the income you'll collect in retirement from pensions and Social Security - as well as the amount you can afford to draw from your personal savings or other sources.</p>

<p>The idea is to assemble the various pieces, and then see whether the picture of retirement life that emerges is acceptable to you.</p>

<p>To help bring the retirement picture into better focus, try plugging all your pertinent financial information - including pensions, Social Security, retirement investment accounts and anticipated retirement expenses - into an online calculator. The calculator can crunch all the numbers and assess your odds of being able to retire on the schedule you envision.</p>

<p>Revisit the calculator and all the different pieces of the puzzle each year, in order to make sure you remain on track.Â </p>
