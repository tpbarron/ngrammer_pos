<p>Got a good answer? Submit it to us in the form below. We'll publish selected reader advice in an upcoming issue. (Your answer may be edited for length and clarity.) Please include your contact information so we can get in touch; if we use your advice in the magazine, we'd like to check with you first, and possibly run your picture as well.</p>
