<p>Do you have a money challenge you need help solving or a financial goal you need help reaching? MONEY magazine may be able to help.</p>

<p>For the magazine's regular "Financial Fix" feature, we're looking for families who would like a free consultation with a financial planner to address their money-related problems and concerns. Participating families must be comfortable with sharing details of their financial life in the magazine, and they will be photographed for the story. To get an idea of what these makeovers are like, you can check out the Financial Fixes of Doug & Sheryll Evans and of Andrea Beck & Donald Yap.</p>

<p>If you're interested, please fill out the confidential form below. Along with your contact information please include a brief description of the challenge you're facing or the goal you're aiming for. Please also tell us about a little about your family's finances, including household income, assets and debts. All of this information will be kept private unless we follow up with you for an interview and you agree to appear in the magazine.</p>

<p>We'll follow up with potential candidates.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
