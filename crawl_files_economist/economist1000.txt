<s>a bollywood comedy released on august 24th “shirin farhad ki toh nikal padi” “shirin and farhad have got it made” revolves around the bumbling courtship of two middleaged parsis</s>
<s>the scene where shirin accidentally eats her engagement ring is pure farce</s>
<s>but much else in the film touches on the real predicament of the parsis that this disproportionately successful indian community is shrinking fast</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the parsis began arriving in bombay now mumbai from gujarat in the 1600s having much earlier fled persia when the spread of islam threatened their zoroastrian religion</s>
<s>over a century later they forged bombay’s rise as a remarkable business hub managing india’s opium sales to china and ploughing the profits into cotton mills and banks</s>
<s>today parsi families such as tata godrej and wadia are among india’s top corporate dynasties with a hand in everything from padlocks to fivestar hotels</s>
<s>the community has its own housing estates hospitals and venturecapital funds</s>
<s>parsis like to describe themselves as india’s jews</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet they are on the wane</s>
<s>perhaps 61000 parsis are left in india today threequarters of them in mumbai</s>
<s>their numbers have fallen by a tenth in each decade since the 1950s</s>
<s>the parsis closed their maternity hospital in mumbai a decade ago because of a lack of births</s>
<s>the venturecapital fund is struggling to find young entrepreneurs</s>
<s>nostalgia pervades parsi clubs where elderly ladies play rummy in faded english dresses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jehangir patel editor of parsiana a magazine for the parsi community says parsis often marry late like the lovebirds in the film or not at all</s>
<s>many migrate to the west</s>
<s>the group’s closed nature poses more problems</s>
<s>the children of women who marry outside do not count as parsis despite an otherwise progressive attitude to women</s>
<s>some zoroastrian priests do not admit converts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in desperation this year the bombay parsi association raised its monthly cash handouts to 3000 rupees $54 for couples with a second child and to 5000 rupees for those with a third</s>
<s>it gives newlyweds first dibs on housing</s>
<s>indian officials are usually focused on keeping a lid on the country’s growing population of 12 billion</s>
<s>yet the national planning commission is mulling a $360000 scheme to increase the parsis’ dwindling numbers through fertility treatments and advertising campaigns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rich youngsters remain unswayed by handouts</s>
<s>the parsi youth association in mumbai founded in 2009 to turn around the shrinking population holds frequent speeddating sessions and produces a calendar of the community’s hottest pinups</s>
<s>it even held a threeday gettogether last year where guests were put up in a plush tata hotel and partied in the corridors</s>
<s>yet even those revels sighs viraf mehta a 34yearold single banker who heads the association led only to fleeting “hookups”</s>
