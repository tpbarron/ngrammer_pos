<s>um hayan a 48yearold mother used to travel the 30 kilometres 19 miles from her home in the wooded hills of jebel turkman to latakia city to buy clothes</s>
<s>there she gossiped with friends stopping off for tea in various villages on the way back up</s>
<s>“now the road has checkpoints and there is no contact between us” she says</s>
<s>her friends are members of an esoteric shia sect known as the alawites who make up 12 of the syrian population including president bashar assad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>seen by many syrians as a driving force behind the regime’s harsh tactics in the civil war alawites have come to feel unwelcome in much of the country</s>
<s>now that is so even in latakia their home region along the mediterranean which had been relatively calm until recently</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some senior security chiefs have sent their families to the province</s>
<s>it could be where the regime plans to make its last stand but it is looking less like a refuge these days</s>
<s>the rebels have made headway in the ethnically mixed province since they gathered local forces several months ago</s>
<s>“on a clear day you can see latakia city” says abu adnan whose hateen brigade has taken up position in an abandoned house</s>
<s>“and these are the alawite villages” he says gesturing to settlements nestled just a few hundred metres away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though the insurgent groups are small poorly armed and not united their knowledge of the mountainous terrain has helped them to take over eight alawite villages</s>
<s>as the death toll on both sides rises and front lines divide sunni and alawite settlements onetime neighbours become enemies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>animosity is likely to worsen</s>
<s>the majority of the local alawites see the war as an islamist uprising that presents a threat to their very existence</s>
<s>the situation is made worse by the growing religiosity of the fighters says a lawyer from the region</s>
<s>men in alawite villages are forming armed popular committees</s>
<s>some appear disillusioned with mr assad angered by what they perceive as a lack of protection for their homes and the death of many sons in the armed forces</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some rebel fighters have quietly set their sights on taking control of qardaha the home village of the assad family and eventually the city of latakia</s>
<s>“we want to live together today tomorrow and in the future” says abu rayan a leader of hijra ila allah a moderately islamist rebel group</s>
<s>“but with so many of our relatives dead tortured and detained few people feel the same”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many residents are rattled</s>
<s>hassan a father whose house lies in ruin at the front line worries that local villages will see massacres like that in houla a small town near homs where regime thugs murdered over 100 people in june</s>
<s>another man says he fears revenge killings by the rebels</s>
<s>sunnis in the area have long resented alawite privileges doled out by the regime including better public services and schools</s>
<s>ill will goes back four decades to when hafez assad the father of the current president won power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sectarian tensions are still low compared with the neighbouring provinces of idleb and aleppo where vicious fighting has raged for months</s>
<s>many rebels in latakia are also relatively liberal in outlook</s>
<s>“our fight is with the regime not the alawites” says abu adnan the cleanshaven leader of hateen sitting with his fighters close to the front line as a helicopter circles overhead</s>
<s>“we understand there is a lot of pressure on them from bashar”</s>
