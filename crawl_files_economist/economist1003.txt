<s>when steve jobs unveiled the iphone in 2007 he changed an industry</s>
<s>apple’s brilliant new device was a huge advance on the mobile phones that had gone before it looked different and it worked better</s>
<s>the iphone represented innovation at its finest making it the topselling smartphone soon after it came out and helping to turn apple into the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalisation that now exceeds $630 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apple’s achievement spawned a raft of imitators</s>
<s>many smartphone manufacturers now boast touchscreens and colourful icons</s>
<s>among them is samsung the world’s biggest technology manufacturer whose gadgets are the iphone’s nearest rivals and closest lookalikes</s>
<s>the competition and the similarities were close enough for apple to sue samsung for patent infringement in several countries spurring the south korean firm to counterclaim that it had been ripped off by apple as well</s>
<s>on august 24th an american jury found that samsung had infringed six patents and ordered it to pay apple more than $1 billion in damages one of the steepest awards yet seen in a patent case see article</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some see thinly disguised protectionism in this decision</s>
<s>that does the jury a disservice its members seem to have stuck to the job of working out whether patent infringements had occurred</s>
<s>the much bigger questions raised by this case are whether all apple’s innovations should have been granted a patent in the first place and the degree to which technology stalwarts and startups alike should be able to base their designs on the breakthroughs of others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is useful to recall why patents exist</s>
<s>the system was established as a tradeoff that provides a public benefit the state agrees to grant a limited monopoly to an inventor in return for disclosing how the technology works</s>
<s>to qualify an innovation must be novel useful and nonobvious which earns the inventor 20 years of exclusivity</s>
<s>“design patents” which cover appearances and are granted after a simpler review process are valid for 14 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dispute between apple and samsung is less over how the devices work and more over their look and feel</s>
<s>at issue are features like the ability to zoom into an image with a double finger tap pinching gestures and the visual “rubber band” effect when you scroll to the end of a page</s>
<s>the case even extends to whether the device and its onscreen icons are allowed to have rounded corners</s>
<s>to be sure some of these things were terrific improvements over what existed before the iphone’s arrival but to award a monopoly right to finger gestures and rounded rectangles is to stretch the definition of “novel” and “nonobvious” to breakingpoint</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a proliferation of patents harms the public in three ways</s>
<s>first it means that technology companies will compete more at the courtroom than in the marketplace—precisely what seems to be happening</s>
<s>second it hampers followon improvements by firms that implement an existing technology but build upon it as well</s>
<s>third it fuels many of the american patent system’s broader problems such as patent trolls speculative lawsuits by patentholders who have no intention of actually making anything defensive patenting acquiring patents mainly to preempt the risk of litigation which raises business costs and “innovation gridlock” the difficulty of combining multiple technologies to create a single new product because too many small patents are spread among too many players</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some basic reforms would alleviate many of the problems exemplified by the iphone lawsuit</s>
<s>the existing criteria for a patent should be applied with greater vigour</s>
<s>specialised courts for patent disputes should be established with technically minded judges in charge the inflated patentdamage awards of recent years are largely the result of jury trials</s>
<s>and if patents are infringed judges should favour monetary penalties over injunctions that ban the sale of offending products and thereby reduce consumer choice</s>

<s>a world of fewer but more robust patents combined with a more efficient method of settling disputes would not just serve the interests of the public but also help innovators like apple</s>
<s>the company is rumoured to be considering an ipad with a smaller screen a format which samsung already sells</s>
<s>what if its plans were blocked by a specious patent</s>
<s>apple’s own early successes were founded on enhancing the best technologies that it saw notably the graphical interface and mouse that were first invented at xerox’s palo alto research centre</s>
<s>“it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done—and then try to bring those things in to what you’re doing” said jobs in a television documentary “triumph of the nerds” in 1996</s>
<s>“and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas”</s>
