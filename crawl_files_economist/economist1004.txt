<s>people living in the towns of subsaharan africa spend a bigger share of their income on food than do urban residents almost anywhere else in the world</s>
<s>labourers often use up over half their wage just to eat</s>
<s>and since africans tend to depend on a few staple crops rises in cereal prices can be devastating</s>
<s>more money on food means less on school fees sanitation and health</s>
<s>it may also mean more girls forced into prostitution and more violent crime</s>

<p>
<s>in some african markets maize and wheat prices have risen by 30 this year</s>
<s>political tension invariably rises too</s>
<s>burkina faso mozambique senegal and uganda have had foodrelated demonstrations and riots</s>
<s>some people worry that price rises may push sierra leone back into chaos and keep c√¥te divoire on edge</s>
<s>higher prices have left providers to the hungriest such as the uns world food programme badly short of cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some african governments are managing food markets well</s>
<s>kenya recently waived duty on wheat and maize imports dampening prices as well as anger</s>
<s>other countries have offset increases by launching foodforwork schemes or handing out vouchers for water and other services to boost the amount of money consumers can spend on food</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but such methods cannot work for ever</s>
<s>food prices may not come down for a long time</s>
<s>moreover shortages in africa are partly caused by inefficient farming an estimated loss of 40 of produce on the way to market and the high cost of fuel</s>
<s>and while africa has more virgin farmland than anywhere else in some areas good land is scarce</s>
<s>many families for instance in western kenya or northern ethiopia have less than the 03 hectares 074 acres deemed the minimum for supporting a family</s>
<s>land title is still often held communally making it nighimpossible for farmers to get credits</s>
<s>women especially find it hard to get property rights though they often do most of the farm work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but not all is gloom</s>
<s>just as high oil prices help africas petroleum economies so higher prices for beans cereals dairy products and meat boost smallholders</s>
<s>rwandas minister of finance john rwangombwa says the higher cost of food imports in his country is partly offset by increased revenues from coffee and tea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are hopes that africa will increase yields by exploiting unfarmed land building more reservoirs warehouses and roads using better seeds and more fertiliser and installing drip irrigation</s>
<s>farm loans crop insurance and saving schemes can help</s>
<s>tanzanias president jakaya kikwete says a $2 billion scheme in his country to develop a transport corridor from dar es salaam the commercial capital to lake malawi may raise production to record levels</s>
<s>but indebted countries that import a lot of food such as neighbouring burundi are likely to get even poorer</s>
