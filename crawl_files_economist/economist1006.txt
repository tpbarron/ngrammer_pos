<s>every summer seattle holds a raft race in green lake a park that is the eponymous home of the water the rafts must cross</s>
<s>entries for the milk carton derby have to be made from old plastic milk bottles</s>
<s>the result is a wonderfully heathrobinson collection of improvised craft</s>
<s>but this year one stood out the entry from the university of washington’s engineering department actually looked like a boat</s>
<s>the students who built it matthew rogge bethany weeks and brandon bowman had shredded and melted their bottles and then used a 3d printer to print themselves a plastic vessel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no doubt the milkcartonderby rules will be tightened next year—though in the end the team came only second</s>
<s>but they did come first in a competition that mattered more</s>
<s>on october 19th they won $100000 in the 3d4d challenge organised by a charity called techfortrade</s>

<p>
<s>3d printing is all the rage at the moment</s>
<s>several varieties of the technique exist using a wide range of materials as the “ink”</s>
<s>one of the most popular methods though—and the one used by the team—works by extruding a filament of molten plastic</s>
<s>in the case of the team’s printer this plastic was highdensity polyethylene from milk bottles</s>
<s>the print head makes repeated passes over the thing being printed leaving a plastic trail as it does so</s>
<s>it thus builds up a threedimensional structure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>3d printing is now taken seriously by manufacturers as an alternative to cutting bending pressing and moulding things</s>
<s>it is also a popular hobby among those of a geeky disposition</s>
<s>what it has not been used for so far is to help people in poor countries improve their everyday lives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr rogge ms weeks and mr bowman intend to employ their prize money to do precisely that</s>
<s>they plan to form a firm that will in partnership with a charity called water for humans custombuild composting toilets and rainwater collectors</s>
<s>the partnership will look for suitable local entrepreneurs in poor countries and will train them how to build use and maintain the printers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once the technology is established for toilets and water collectors other products will be introduced</s>
<s>the local partners will know what products are needed and how much people are prepared to pay for them—and therefore what is worth making</s>
<s>the operation will thus run on a commercial basis</s>
<s>but the software that controls the printers will be opensource and available to all as will many of the designs for things the printers can make</s>
<s>that way the technology can spread</s>
<s>a trial will begin soon in oaxaca mexico</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the crucial point about the team’s printer is that it combines size and cheapness</s>
<s>printers used by hobbyists are not expensive but they are small</s>
<s>many would find it hard to make anything larger than a coffee cup</s>
<s>those used by engineering companies cost serious money—and even they might balk at printing an object the size of the milk carton derby boat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the team’s printer is built around a secondhand computercontrolled plasma cutter a device used for carving up sheets of metal</s>
<s>this directs the movement of an extruder that melts flakes of plastic into a thin stream which can be squirted out as required</s>
<s>it is able to create things with dimensions of up to 25 metres by 12 metres by 1 metre</s>
<s>appropriately many of its parts were themselves manufactured on a desktop 3d printer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ink is cheap too</s>
<s>highdensity polyethylene is as common as muck—literally for a lot of it ends up on refuse tips</s>
<s>chop it up though and it is grist to the mill</s>
<s>mr rogge estimates that if he and his colleagues had printed their boat from commercial plastic filament it would have cost them $800</s>
<s>instead 250 clean empty milk bottles set them back just $320</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some technical questions remain</s>
<s>highdensity polyethylene shrinks when it cools</s>
<s>that stresses the object being printed and can sometimes tear it apart</s>
<s>the students are therefore working on a second prototype that prints things faster allowing the layers of plastic to cool almost simultaneously</s>
<s>they are also experimenting with making things from other types of waste plastic that suffer less from shrinkage</s>
<s>and until a production version of the printer is ready and priced it remains to be seen how competitive its output really will be with massproduced items</s>
<s>mr rogge doubts for example that a 3dprinted bucket—even one made from milk bottles—will ever be cheaper than one made in a factory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>boats though could be a hit</s>
<s>one of the judges at the 3d4d challenge noted that many small vessels in west africa are made from trees such as teak that are becoming scarce</s>
<s>making them from waste plastic instead would be an environmental twofer rare species would be conserved and less rubbish thrown away</s>
