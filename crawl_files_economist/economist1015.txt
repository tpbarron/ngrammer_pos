<s>barely a month goes by without a new oil discovery in africa</s>
<s>only five of the continent’s 55 countries are neither producing nor exploring for oil</s>
<s>most places are also extracting lots of lucrative minerals</s>
<s>a resource bonanza is in train across the continent generating big government revenues and real benefits for africans</s>
<s>road networks are expanding public services are improving</s>
<s>but most of this happens behind a veil of secrecy</s>
<s>money sloshes out of public scrutiny at the insistence of officials and politicians who prefer it that way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if squeakyclean western multinationals are involved transparency over payments for resources is minimal</s>
<s>ordinary people can rarely find out how much goes into government kitties</s>
<s>that makes it easier for insiders to line their pockets</s>
<s>monitoring groups say corruption has been rising</s>
<s>ministerial car parks are filled with the fanciest limousines</s>
<s>a lot of money still reaches public budgets but without oversight it is often badly spent</s>
<s>many new roads go nowhere or are barely used shiny new hospitals are often understaffed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the resulting frustration can trigger violence</s>
<s>in angola africa’s secondbiggest oil producer activists have been demanding a fairer distribution of revenues the government has responded with a bloody crackdown see article</s>
<s>south africa has just seen the worst disturbances since the apartheid era with 34 platinum miners shot dead during a wildcat strike</s>
<s>resources can also fuel international conflicts</s>
<s>the two sudans went to the brink of war earlier this year over oil</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>african governments have become more democratic and better at delivering services</s>
<s>yet the combination of rising mineral wealth and continuing poverty is explosive</s>
<s>after decades of misrule even the most competent officials are often suspected of pinching funds</s>
<s>more transparency is what is needed to ensure that resource wealth is used better and distributed more fairly</s>
<s>much of angola’s income is managed by a national oil company that is shielded from oversight by commercial secrecy</s>
<s>the oil revenues of equatorial guinea where threequarters of the population live below the poverty line are a state secret</s>
<s>this is both wrong and dangerous</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the challenge for western firms and governments is how to help african citizens wheedle data out of their governments so as to hold them more to account</s>
<s>a decade ago britain’s tony blair had a go promoting the extractive industries transparency initiative</s>
<s>as many as three dozen countries in africa and elsewhere agreed to publish details of payments from oil and mining companies</s>
<s>but the scheme was voluntary the worst offenders either refused to join or dragged their feet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>follow america’s lead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>america’s securities and exchange commission has now come up with a set of rules</s>
<s>the 1100 resource companies listed on american stock exchanges which make up half the global industry by value will be required to publish all payments to foreign governments above $100000</s>
<s>the european union is talking of introducing similar requirements</s>
<s>it should do so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some western investors say such rules involve costly red tape</s>
<s>without some hidden payments to officials business will be lost they add</s>
<s>divulging the details of every deal will give secrets away to competitors</s>
<s>moreover nonwestern companies especially chinese ones will gain an advantage because they will escape such scrutiny</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bureaucratic cost will not be large since companies will merely have to make public figures that are currently held privately</s>
<s>and some chinese firms will find themselves subject to similar requirements because many are or plan to be listed in america</s>
<s>moreover if the west changes its behaviour china may too</s>
<s>after years of claiming that unlike western imperialists it supports africa’s people not its dictators it may feel it has to back the publication of data about payments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there is no guarantee that china will see the light and in the meantime western companies are likely to find themselves at a disadvantage</s>
<s>so be it</s>
<s>western countries already spend money and political capital on trying to promote democracy encourage development and discourage corruption in africa</s>
<s>helping africa use its mineral wealth to achieve those ends is worth paying a price for</s>
