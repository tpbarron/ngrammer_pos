<s>at times it can seem as though london is stuck in 2008</s>
<s>the property market is still buoyant and at the top end still hotly contested by the global rich</s>
<s>costly projects such as the citytraversing crossrail and the olympic games have not fallen victim to austerity</s>
<s>and in may voters will be asked to choose between the same two mayoral candidates who were on the ballot four years ago boris johnson the conservative incumbent and ken livingstone his labour predecessor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr johnson pictured above is the current favourite</s>
<s>an opinion poll last november gave him a lead of 48 to 40 brian paddick the liberal democrat candidate and another 2008 retread registered just 7</s>
<s>the incumbent who is known for his chaotic charisma has run the city competently enough</s>
<s>crime has continued to fall and minor improvements have been made to public transport including a cyclehire scheme and the end of the hated “bendy” bus</s>
<s>mr johnson has also frozen city halls take from local taxes and lobbied for more infrastructure spending and a looser immigration policy</s>
<s>although he has many fewer powers than an american bigcity mayor—the central government and the capitals 32 boroughs collectively have more sway—mr johnson has asserted some new ones</s>
<s>he has turned himself into a spokesman for the city as the financial district is known</s>
<s>in 2008 he sacked londons police chief</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what he cannot boast is a single dominating achievement such as the central london congestion charge that mr livingstone pioneered</s>
<s>mr johnson hopes that his legacy will be a commitment by the government to build a vast new airport to replace heathrow which is stretched and difficult to expand</s>
<s>ministers are warming to the idea but slowly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>closer than you think</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is a pervasive assumption even in the labour party that the mayoral race is a foregone conclusion</s>
<s>it is not</s>
<s>london leans left—as big diverse cities tend to</s>
<s>mr livingstone knowing that voters often punish governments between general elections aims to paint his rival as just another tory</s>
<s>and although the polls suggest that londoners prefer mr johnson on policing the economy and the olympics he trails on the vital issue of transport</s>
<s>a spate of strikes on the tube has encouraged the view that mr livingstone a machine politician and a man of the left is better at dealing with londons ornery unions</s>
<s>the former mayor is also promising to cut fares which rose on january 2nd</s>
<s>having struggled to win support in outer london last time he is campaigning hard outside his urban comfortzone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ideological fault line is clearer than in 2008</s>
<s>as mayor “red ken” defied his caricature by championing the city and encouraging private developers</s>
<s>in his zeal for growth and in his ease with londons role as a capitalist hub he evinced much the same municipal philosophy as mr johnson</s>
<s>the crash however revived some of the old religion in mr livingstone who has been scathing about bankers and sympathetic to protesters occupying parts of the city</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mayoral election has implications for national politics</s>
<s>victory for mr johnson would be another blow to ed miliband whose performance as labour party leader is attracting criticism</s>
<s>defeat for the incumbent would only be a passing nuisance for david cameron the tory prime minister but the effect on the future of his party could be profound</s>
<s>mr cameron predicts privately that he will be succeeded by either the mayor or george osborne the chancellor of the exchequer</s>
<s>but mr johnsons prospects rest on being seen as a winner</s>
<s>defeat at the hands of an ageing predecessor at 66 mr livingstone is 19 years older than the mayor would be hard for even such an ebullient man to shrug off</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the challenges facing the next mayor are immense</s>
<s>there are new threats to the city from domestic and european regulation as well as severe housing shortages and social problems of the kind exposed by the riots of last summer</s>
<s>but the prize is even greater the chance to run europes biggest city and preside over a highprofile sporting event in the summer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>winning the olympics marked londons rebirth in recent decades as perhaps the ultimate global city</s>
<s>but it was also the culmination of another less remarkedupon story the gradual migration of wealth and energy to the east of the city</s>
<s>since the 1980s the dilapidated east has seen the redevelopment of the docklands new transport infrastructure and an influx of creative types to neighbourhoods such as shoreditch and dalston</s>
<s>the mooted new airport is to the east of the capital</s>
<s>stratford formerly a barren patch is the site of the olympic stadium and village</s>
<s>both mr johnson and mr livingstone have helped to deliver that project</s>
<s>only one will be able to present it to the world</s>
