<s>sunny countries are often poor</s>
<s>it is a shame then that solar power is still quite expensive</s>
<s>but it is getting cheaper by the day and is now cheap enough to be competitive with other forms of energy in places that are not attached to electricity grids</s>
<s>since 16 billion people are still in that unfortunate position there is now a large potential market for solar energy</s>
<s>the problem is that although sunlight is free a lot of those 16 billion people still cannot afford the upfront cost of the equipment in one go and no one will lend them the money needed to buy it</s>

<s>eight19 a british company spun out of cambridge university has devised a clever way to get round this</s>
<s>in return for a deposit of around $10 it is supplying poor families in kenya with a solar cell able to generate 25 watts of electricity a battery that can deliver a 3amp current to store this electricity and a lamp whose bulb is an energyefficient lightemitting diode</s>
<s>the firm reckons that once the battery is fully charged this system is sufficient to light two small rooms and to power a mobilephone charger for seven hours</s>
<s>then the next day it can be put outside and charged back up again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the trick is that to be able to use the electricity the systems keeper must buy a scratch card—for as little as a dollar—on which a reference number is printed</s>
<s>the keeper sends this reference plus the serial number of the household solar unit by text message to eight19</s>
<s>the companys server will respond automatically with an access code to the unit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>users may feel as though they are paying an hourly rate for their electricity</s>
<s>in fact they are paying off the cost of the unit</s>
<s>after buying around $80worth of scratch cards—which eight19 expects would take the average family about 18 months—the user will own it</s>
<s>he will then have the option of continuing to use it for nothing or trading it in for a bigger model perhaps driven by a 10watt solar cell</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in that case he would then go through the same process again paying off the additional cost of the upgraded kit at a slightly higher rate</s>
<s>users would thereby increase their electricity supply—ascending the “energy escalator” as eight19 puts it—steadily and affordably</s>
<s>simultaneously the company would be able to build a payment record of its clients sorting the unreliable from the rest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to eight19s figures this looks like a good deal for customers</s>
<s>the firm reckons that the average energystarved kenyan spends about $10 a month on paraffin—sufficient to fuel a couple of smoky lamps—plus $2 a month to have his mobile phone charged at a nearby market</s>
<s>regular users of one of eight19s basic solar units will spend around half that before owning it outright</s>
<s>meanwhile as the cost of solar technology falls the whole system should get even cheaper</s>
<s>the company hopes to be able to supply users with a new lowcost and robust sort of solar cell printed onto plastic strips within two years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far the scheme has been tried out among a couple of hundred kenyan families</s>
<s>with the aid of a charitable loan to accelerate its rollout eight19 is now in the process of dispersing another 4000 solar units in kenya malawi and zambia</s>
<s>if its novel idea works solar power will come within reach of a whole new set of customers—and the days of the paraffin lamp could well be numbered</s>
