<s>mining coal is a dirty business dirty enough for a mother lode of filth in the latest corruption case to touch india’s congressled government</s>
<s>a new report by the comptroller and auditor general cag suggests that murky allocations of coal blocks by officials to mining companies have caused losses to the exchequer of perhaps $34 billion in recent years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cag’s sums may well be overstated and the allegations inevitably dubbed “coalgate” are nothing new</s>
<s>yet the scandal has had a sudden political impact</s>
<s>in parliament which is about to finish its summer session it is a handy stick for the gleeful opposition the bharatiya janata party bjp to wield against the prime minister manmohan singh</s>
<s>the bjp roars that mr singh who oversaw the coal ministry for years must go</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr singh will not resign over this however and opposition mps know it as in private they chortle over congress’s discomfort</s>
<s>each morning they pour into the chambers of parliament’s lower and upper houses causing enough of a ruckus for the speaker to call off the day’s business</s>
<s>debate moves instead to the evening television shows where party spokesmen screech allegations at each other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and so parliament is on course for a new record in sitting the fewest number of days</s>
<s>the bjp leader in the upper house arun jaitley says obstructionism is sometimes warranted</s>
<s>congress when in opposition used similar tactics</s>
<s>some speculate that the bjp may next try to force an early election one is due by 2014 by ordering its 116 mps to resign en masse</s>
<s>but that tactic will not work if other parties do not join it</s>
<s>even mr jaitley told the economist recently that “2014 is not so far away”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>demands for an inquiry into sales of coal blocks certainly make sense</s>
<s>mr singh had been pushing for a new policy to auction minerals ensuring that the best price is paid and that nobody gets any favours</s>
<s>but it took eight years to put the policy in place time enough for contracts to be hastily dished out including to cronies</s>
<s>the ruling coalition has questions to answer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for all that the bjp’s boycotts of parliament still look irresponsible</s>
<s>the party’s aim in the short term may be to capture some of the public rage over corruption that a street movement led by a gandhian campaigner anna hazare had successfully marshalled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet although corruption is important focusing on it to the exclusion of all else is harmful</s>
<s>india’s economic growth is slowing and such urgent problems as a continuing large budget deficit are being ignored</s>
<s>the bjp and congress should in theory be able to agree on changes that produce big benefits such as cutting diesel subsidies introducing a goods and services tax and lifting caps for foreign investors in sectors from aviation to pensions management</s>
<s>as recently as july mr jaitley said “we could agree on many things if the government tried to get an atmosphere of consensus” that now sounds rich</s>
<s>getting a consensus on anything before 2014 is starting to look most unlikely</s>
