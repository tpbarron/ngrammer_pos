<s>the dutch have not been quite their usual tolerant selves over the past decade</s>
<s>first came the rise of rightwing antimuslim populists such as the late pim fortuyn and more recently geert wilders railing against an elite bureaucracy in the hague that pursues the same compromise policies regardless of what coalition is in power</s>
<s>there followed a clampdown on immigration the tightening of the country’s signature lenient druguse policy and the nationalist tablethumping of dutch ministers at recent eurozone crisis summits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the netherlands seemed to have turned away from its longstanding reputation as a country of proeuropean pragmatists</s>
<s>but the unveiling of the new dutch coalition agreement on october 29th promised a return to form</s>
<s>framed by a poster of a newly built bridge mark rutte the liberal vvd prime minister and diederik samsom the pvda labour party leader laid out a governing programme that sets the country on a firmly centrist course</s>
<s>the two parties were forced into a coalition together when september’s elections produced huge votes for the centreright and centreleft</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the coalition accord tackles a series of domestic issues that have bedevilled dutch politics for years entailing sacrifices for both parties</s>
<s>the liberals broke a campaign promise by accepting sharp limits on tax deductibility for mortgage interest</s>
<s>labour must swallow a cut in the top income tax rate from 52 to 49</s>
<s>on europe mr rutte has often seemed ambivalent over the past two years as his coalition depended on backing from the eurosceptic mr wilders</s>
<s>the new coalition accord shows immediate signs of a shift to the left</s>
<s>the government will back brussels’ proposed financialtransaction tax a direct reversal of policy from mr rutte’s previous term</s>
<s>labour will get the important finance and foreignaffairs portfolios</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most remarkable has been the widespread embrace of the new centrist government in a country that until recently had been torn by radical parties on both extremes</s>
<s>economists have praised the move to ratchet down the mortgageinterest deduction which has given the netherlands the heaviest household debtload in the eurozone</s>
<s>and the head of the country’s most powerful business alliance glowingly announced that the netherlands’ famous model of businesslabour compromise had been restored “the polder model is back”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whether everyone will welcome its return is another question</s>
<s>voters backed the right or the left but got a government of the centre</s>
<s>for the moment though after a decade of upheaval and political polarisation and gridlock the public seems warily relieved to see holland go back to being dutch again</s>
