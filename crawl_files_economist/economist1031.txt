<s>“the people of zambia have spoken and we must all listen” a defeated president rupiah banda intoned on september 23rd</s>
<s>his movement for multiparty democracy had ruled zambia for the past 20 years</s>
<s>yet when the opposition leader michael sata and his patriotic front won a pretty fair presidential election by a margin of 43 to 36 the incumbent bowed out with a good grace</s>
<s>in neighbouring countries and across africa such fine behaviour is still unusual</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but democracy in one shape or another is a lot more widely practised than it was</s>
<s>from around 1960 when africas colonies first became independent until 1991 not a single one of africas 53 countries now 54 including south sudan witnessed any leader or ruling party being peacefully voted out of office with the noble exception of mauritius an island in the indian ocean in 1982</s>
<s>elsewhere a handful of presidents such as tanzanias late julius nyerere voluntarily stepped down</s>
<s>since 1991 however no less than 30 ruling parties or leaders have been ousted by voters for a full list see table online</s>
<s>the kenyan and zambian ones were among those chucked out</s>
<s>such cases are still a minority—and kenyas most recent general election at the end of 2007 ended in strife</s>
<s>but multiparty democracy albeit with hiccups and setbacks has undoubtedly gained ground</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover african governments have come to enjoy the respectability that arises from proper elections</s>
<s>they can expect extra aid as well as warm words on visits to western capitals</s>
<s>ghana which has had the best recent record in peacefully ousting its leaders and ruling parties was honoured by barack obama with his first presidential visit to subsaharan africa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the oneparty state is no longer the african norm</s>
<s>rulers who have entrenched themselves for decades now at least go through the motions of having elections 17 of them are due to have been held this year</s>
<s>most of them have so far passed off smoothly a good half were credible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>only tiny swaziland is still an absolute monarchy</s>
<s>almost every other subsaharan country has a presidential system with elections often irregular</s>
<s>guinea for instance had a 51year gap between its two latest polls but had a fair election late last year which reaffirmed alpha condé as its president</s>
<s>in july mr obama in a gesture of support for african democrats welcomed four freely elected francophone west african leaders to the white house including mr condé côte divoires alassane ouattara who last year beat an incumbent who then refused to concede and the leaders of niger and benin</s>

<s>ethiopia is africas only big country with a nonpresidential parliamentary system sadly it has lapsed into harsh authoritarian rule under meles zenawi</s>
<s>now that libyas muammar qaddafi has fallen mauritania is africas only overt military dictatorship but even its leader general muhammad ould abdel aziz has taken off his uniform and claims to have won an election</s>
<s>algeria is one of only a few countries still ultimately run by soldiers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>african leaders whether true democrats or not now spend vast amounts of money arranging elections</s>
<s>civilsociety groups say this years nigerian polls cost the state $580m probably a world record</s>
<s>congo may beat that in november with help from the un and other outsiders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such costs do not alas always mean free and fair elections</s>
<s>opposition groups are often hamstrung and harassed</s>
<s>the only countries classified as entirely free by freedom house a washingtonbased thinktank are on africas southern tip and on the fringes of west africa</s>
<s>everywhere else proclaimed democrats at the top of the greasy pole use an array of dodgy methods to ensure that opponents cannot climb up from below</s>
<s>nigerias hugely expensive polls were still riddled with fraud</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rwandas president paul kagame was reelected last year with 93 of the vote</s>
<s>he is feted in many western capitals most recently in paris for his impressive record in development</s>
<s>yet at home he is becoming increasingly repressive</s>
<s>the opposition is intimidated independent journalists are threatened critical priests imprisoned dissenters persecuted and sometimes even killed</s>
<s>yet you can be sure that mr kagame will hold an election whenever the constitution demands it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the winds of democratic change in the arab world whose record has hitherto been far worse than africas have begun to billow south</s>
<s>african prodemocracy movements have perked up apparently emboldened by the arab awakening</s>
<s>many usually placid african countries have experienced demonstrations in favour of more representative government</s>
<s>“the arab spring has been a great inspiration to us” says billy mayaya head of malawis civil and political space platform</s>
<s>“but different dynamics are involved”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>street protests are flourishing nonetheless</s>
<s>earlier this year botswana africas golden boy thanks to a strong economy good governance and a free press had its first national publicsector strike initially over pay students opposition supporters and civilrights campaigners joined in</s>
<s>in july in sleepy malawi 20 demonstrators were killed by security forces</s>
<s>president bingu wa mutharika then sacked his entire government and said he would rule on his own though he recently appointed a new cabinet</s>
<s>when he was shown a leaked cable from the british high commissioner that said he was “autocratic and intolerant of criticism” he promptly proved the diplomats point by expelling him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even in tightly controlled angola where josé eduardo dos santos has held power since 1979 and the same ruling party has governed since independence in 1975 protests albeit so far small ones are bubbling</s>
<s>a demonstration planned in march was called off after opposition politicians received death threats</s>
<s>several organisers were arrested</s>
<s>in april 300 protesters demanded the release of those detained</s>
<s>in september another batch of people were arrested after violent protests</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>zambia has again set a good example</s>
<s>peaceful adversarial politics—concepts such as a loyal opposition truly independent judges and a civil service that is neutral and not in hock to ruling politicians—are still not the norm</s>
<s>yet growing numbers of africans with a burgeoning educated middle class to the fore are calling for such things</s>
<s>that is itself progress</s>

<s>correction britains senior representative in malawi is a high commissioner not an ambassador as we first wrote</s>
