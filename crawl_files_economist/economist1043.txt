<s>no sooner had president françois hollande named him “investment commissioner” in july than louis gallois a respected french industrialist made clear his concern over france’s competitiveness problem</s>
<s>the economy he announced needed nothing less than a “competitiveness shock” a huge transfer of €30 billion $388 billion to €50 billion of taxes from the payroll to broadbased forms of taxation including vat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>four months later on november 5th mr gallois who once ran french railways as well as the aerospace group eads is due to hand in his report on competitiveness to mr hollande</s>
<s>as he will probably be bold in his recommendations it looks worryingly as if the french government will politely put his report to one side</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr gallois’s diagnosis is likely to be damning</s>
<s>over the past 12 years france has steadily lost competitiveness to germany its fellow eurozone giant</s>
<s>a recent competitiveness study by the world economic forum ranked germany sixth and france 21st</s>
<s>labour costs have risen far faster than in germany</s>
<s>french public spending at 56 of gdp is ten percentage points higher than in germany</s>
<s>france’s share of extraeu exports has dropped and the trade deficit has reached €70 billion</s>
<s>the netherlands with a fraction of its population now exports more than france</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>business is particularly concerned about the outlook right now owing to changes announced in the 2013 budget which was unveiled in september and is mr hollande’s first</s>
<s>it increases taxation by €20 billion half of which hits companies while promising only €10 billion in publicsector savings</s>
<s>in anticipation of such taxes say business bosses uncertainty prevails nobody is investing or recruiting</s>
<s>the high employerwelfare taxes on middleearning workers those on the minimum wage get exemptions which can be over twice the share of gross salaries levied in germany are a deterrent to job creation even in good times</s>
<s>in a letter to the president the heads of france’s biggest businesses called for a cut of €30 billion in such payroll taxes over the next two years to kickstart job creation and encourage firms to grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr hollande at least seems to recognise the problem</s>
<s>although competitiveness scarcely featured in his election campaign he admits today that something is wrong in france</s>
<s>what seems to have changed in recent weeks however is the idea that something should be done about it right away</s>
<s>on october 29th at a big meeting with international organisations in paris mr hollande talked of the need not for an immediate “competitiveness shock” but merely for a competitiveness “pact”</s>
<s>this he announced would cover “all elements of competitiveness” not simply labour costs and be spread over five years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the hesitations of the socialists are partly owing to divisions within the government but also because of new worries about choking off consumer spending and thus growth</s>
<s>pierre moscovici the finance minister told french radio that the government would not cut social charges radically in the short run “because it would hurt purchasing power”</s>
<s>short of cutting spending taxes would have to be transferred to vat or to other broadbased taxes</s>
<s>with the french economy widely expected to be in recession in 2013 that risk along with the social discontent that could spread on to the streets is one the government is not prepared to take</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as patrick artus chief economist at natixis bank points out this would matter less were the government ready to press ahead with labourmarket reform</s>
<s>“our country cannot delay these…any longer” pascal lamy head of the wto told le point a weekly magazine recently “what is missing is flexibility initiative and creativity” mr hollande has asked bosses and unions to sit down until the end of the year to discuss ways to make it easier to moderate pay and hours at a branch or company level</s>
<s>but the chances of all the unions agreeing to a deal are slim</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in recent years several french reports calling for structural reforms to boost competitiveness job creation and economic growth have been written by the country’s best brains</s>
<s>every year the cour des comptes the national audit office compiles excellent studies pointing to inefficiencies in public spending and how this cramps growth</s>
<s>most such reports end up lining bookshelves and gathering dust</s>
<s>with his parliamentary majority in both houses and control of all local government mr hollande has quasimonarchical powers to implement mr gallois’s recommendations</s>
<s>he should have the courage not to shelve this latest report just like all the others</s>
