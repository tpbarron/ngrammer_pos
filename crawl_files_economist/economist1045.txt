<s>when environmental activists start using drones to track down japanese whaling vessels as they did in december it is a sure sign that uavs unmanned aerial vehicles are no longer the sole prerogative of the armed forces</s>
<s>police around the world are keen to use small pilotless aircraft to help them nab fleeing criminals and monitor crime scenes from above</s>
<s>with price tags of a little more and in some cases a good deal less than the $40000 of a patrol car a new generation of microuavs is being recruited to replace police helicopters costing $17m and up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>aside from helping enforce the law any civilian activity that could be improved by having an aerial view—monitoring traffic checking electricity cables and pipelines surveying forestry and crops taking aerial photographs patrolling wooded areas for fire—would benefit from the use of uavs</s>
<s>the limiting factor is not technological but regulatory</s>
<s>in america the federal aviation administration faa currently allows the recreational use of drones but not commercial use earlier this year estate agents in los angeles were banned from using drones to take aerial photos of properties they were selling for example</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>change is coming however</s>
<s>the european commission has held a series of hearings on the subject the most recent on february 9th to determine a regulatory framework to enable the wider use of uavs by civilians</s>
<s>in america a bill passed by the senate on february 6th and now awaiting presidential approval requires the faa to draw up new rules so that the skies can be safely opened to drone flights from october 2015</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that will be easier said than done</s>
<s>how for example should a uav respond if it loses its communications link with the operator on the ground</s>
<s>should it automatically return to some preassigned location or head for the nearest open space</s>
<s>should it have a parachute arrangement—like an increasing number of private planes—to lower it gently to the ground in an emergency or put itself immediately into a stall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another question is how uavs should detect sense and avoid other aircraft operating in the same airspace</s>
<s>so far the faa has issued around 300 temporary permits for testing drones in airspace where commercial air traffic and private aircraft operate</s>
<s>but because none of the pilotless aircraft intended for civilian use can yet comply with the faas “sense and avoid” rules a ground observer or chase aircraft is required to keep the drone in sight at all times to act as its eyes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the faas rationale is that drones piloted remotely by operators on the ground cannot see other aircraft in the sky in the way airborne pilots can</s>
<s>its preferred approach is for uavs to be fitted with equipment to avoid midair collisions and near misses</s>
<s>one solution to the senseandavoid problem is to use an array of lightweight acoustic probes coupled to a signal processor</s>
<s>by filtering out wind noise this setup can listen for and locate other aircraft in the sky—and then transmit avoidance instructions to the drones operator on the ground or enable it to take evasive action itself</s>
<s>one such system developed by sara a contractresearch firm based in cypress california weighs little more than eight ounces 225 grams</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but given the small size of many drones and the environments in which they will be used requiring them all to have elaborate senseandavoid systems may be overkill</s>
<s>the majority of pilotless planes that civilian agencies have their eyes on are little bigger than model aircraft and weigh much the same</s>
<s>one that is fancied by americas 18000 police forces is a pilotless helicopter called the qube</s>
<s>this fourrotor craft made by aerovironment of monrovia california weighs in at 55lb 25kg and fits easily in the boot of a car</s>
<s>it can be assembled in minutes to provide an immediate eye in the sky capable of staying aloft for 40 minutes at a time after which its battery needs recharging</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the qube and similarly sized drones have about the same kinetic energy as a large bird</s>
<s>in other words the threat they pose to other planes in the sky and property on the ground is akin to a bird strike</s>
<s>that is not to be taken lightly but is something society has learned to live with</s>
<s>moreover such drones are expected to fly well below 400 feet 120 metres and probably like the rules governing model aircraft no closer than 3 miles 5km from an airport</s>
<s>that is not exactly class a airspace used by commercial air traffic making lifethreatening midair collisions unlikely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nowhere to hide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>safety is not the only concern associated with the greater use of civilian drones however</s>
<s>there is also the question of privacy</s>
<s>in america at least neither the constitution nor common law prohibits the police the media or anyone else from operating surveillance drones</s>
<s>as the law stands citizens do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place</s>
<s>that includes parts of their own backyards that are visible from a public vantage point including the sky</s>
<s>the supreme court has been very clear on the matter</s>
<s>the american civil liberties union a campaign group says drones raise “very serious privacy issues” and are pushing america “willynilly toward an era of aerial surveillance without any steps to protect the traditional privacy that americans have always enjoyed and expected”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the aclus main worry is the use of drones for surveillance by the police</s>
<s>that is a legitimate concern but it is not hard to imagine other ways in which uavs will erode privacy</s>
<s>given the rapid progress being made in the field how long before paparazzi photographers are sending insectlike drones to peek through celebrities windows for example</s>
<s>or think of the possibilities for the use of drones in industrial espionage</s>
<s>given their potential for legitimate use in law enforcement agriculture disaster recovery construction and security it seems likely that thousands of drones will take to the air in the coming years</s>
<s>but expect the lawsuits to fly too</s>
