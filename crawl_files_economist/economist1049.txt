<s>the first time he tried to create the “next generation of schools” back in the early 1990s chris whittle’s focus was on improving the education of the poorest pupils in america’s worstperforming public schools</s>
<s>although in doing so the perennially bowtied entrepreneur from tennessee helped pioneer the charterschool movement his edison project ultimately failed to thrive as a business</s>
<s>now with benno schmidt and alan greenberg he is trying to reinvent education for bright rich kids</s>
<s>on september 10th “avenues the world school” the first of a planned global network will welcome 700 pupils into a lavishly converted warehouse next to manhattan’s popular high line park</s>
<s>their parents will typically pay just under $40000 a year in line with new york’s established toptier private schools having been promised cuttingedge technology and everything else to match</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>getting this far has not been easy for mr whittle who says he has had to become “one third educator one third realestate developer and one third investment banker” after conceiving the idea in 2007 of creating a chain of similar schools in the world’s leading cities the financial crisis robbed him of funding a business partner and the intended first manhattan site</s>
<s>eventually he raised the $75m needed to get the first school up and running found another site and then toured the world to recruit staff and pupils</s>
<s>many of the teaching staff have previously worked at other elite eastcoast private schools including phillips exeter hotchkiss and dalton</s>
<s>even more gratifying than the 2600 applications to attend avenues were the 4900 applications it received to teach there says mr whittle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of the reasons why mr whittle sees a profitable opportunity for a new entrant is that global demand for elite private education has soared in recent years while—not least because of the sort of problems he has encountered above all in finding suitable sites—supply has remained fairly static</s>
<s>he is now raising a larger fund to build the next few schools which are expected to be in beijing 2014 são paulo 2015 and london 2016</s>
<s>he thinks there are 20 cities that could sustain an avenues school and hopes to have built one in each of them within a decade</s>
<s>each will teach an identical curriculum and not only will pupils be able to move freely between them they will be expected to spend at least a year studying abroad as boarders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>equipping pupils to prosper in the global economy is at the core of the avenues curriculum which has been developed by various experts including some from harvard’s school of education</s>
<s>mr whittle thinks that even america’s best private schools have a “stale” curriculum in this respect especially when it comes to foreign languages which often are not taught until pupils are 11</s>
<s>from the day they enter kindergarten at avenues pupils will be taught half their lessons in a foreign tongue either mandarin or spanish—an “immersion” process that mr whittle reckons will make every pupil fully bilingual within seven years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr whittle clearly relishes the freedom private education allows him to innovate without the regulations and hostile unions that dogged him in the public sector at edison</s>
<s>he admits to some regret at the lack of an overt social mission to help those who are failed most by america’s education system</s>
<s>on the other hand he points out avenues has set aside $4m a year to fund full scholarships for 100 or partial scholarships for more than that of the school’s eventual 1600strong student body</s>
<s>he also believes that some of the innovations pioneered at avenues will eventually be adopted by governmentfunded schools the bilingual immersion process for instance could be introduced at next to no cost he reckons</s>
<s>perhaps</s>
<s>as for making money having given so much thought to how to survive on the $8000 a pupil that edison used to get from the government mr whittle says he should have no trouble profiting from parents who will pay five times as much</s>
