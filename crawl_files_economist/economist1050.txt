<s>bondage says harsh mander a prominent indian social activist “is endemic</s>
<s>it is an essential factor of labour relations across india” on october 31st mr mander and a host of others launched a new campaign against the practice</s>
<s>the desperately poor especially indebted villagers are often forced to toil for no wages and denied a chance to work elsewhere</s>
<s>they are slaves in all but name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>depending how you define it—workers are usually snared after an employer gives or promises a small loan—victims number possibly in the millions</s>
<s>one activist describes how last year his group helped to free 512 bonded workers trapped in a single brick kiln in tamil nadu</s>
<s>all were migrants ferried in by a middleman from distant odisha</s>
<s>they spoke no tamil and had no notion of their legal rights or of a means of escape</s>
<s>in another case some of the 30 bonded workers found in a rice mill said that they had inherited debts from their parents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite a 1975 law banning debt bondage almost nobody is ever prosecuted</s>
<s>in any case the stipulated fine—2000 rupees $37—is laughable and hardly anyone is jailed</s>
<s>the campaigners in delhi introduced gurwail singh in order to make their point</s>
<s>a punjabi mr singh says that five years ago he borrowed 5000 rupees from a farmer and agreed to work on the fields to pay his debt</s>
<s>but after the employer slapped him with arbitrary “fines” plus high rates of interest he was told he owed over 100000 rupees</s>
<s>he complained and was beaten so badly he ended up in hospital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in some states notably punjab officials routinely insist the feudal practice no longer exists</s>
<s>but when mr singh tried to prosecute his old boss the case was rejected</s>
<s>indeed his then employer is countersuing</s>
<s>activists gather other examples</s>
<s>a recent survey of 120 villages in tamil nadu and andhra pradesh unearthed 286 people considered bonded labourers</s>
<s>other exploitation verges on bonded labour unpaid workers and girls sent to work in a relative’s textile mill who earn no wages but a lump sum to be used as a dowry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tougher punishments would help plus inspections of farms and industries like brickyards that make intense use of cheap labour</s>
<s>more attention should be paid to tribal people and the lowest castes who supply most bonded workers</s>
<s>but the most effective change would be economic</s>
<s>encouragingly rural incomes are rising fast a national survey of consumption in july suggested villagers are gaining wealth faster than urbanites</s>
<s>a state guarantee of 100 days of paid work for every family is also helping</s>
<s>if poor villagers like mr singh could also get property deeds and access to banks and loans then the power of informal moneylenders would fall too</s>
