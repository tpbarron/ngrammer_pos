<s>a new round of air wars looms and more than londons transport links is in the firing line</s>
<s>boris johnson the mayor has written to the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne asking him to consider examining “the case for the delivery of a new aviation infrastructure and …increased aviation capacity” to serve the capital</s>
<s>carefully timed before the budget on march 23rd mr johnsons ploy could reopen a long and bitter argument over what sort of airport capacity london needs and where to provide it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with only two fulllength runways and over 66m passengers a year using them heathrow airport is at bursting point</s>
<s>it is also hemmed in by homes making any expansion unpopular</s>
<s>the labour governments plan for a third runway there was defeated in 2008 after opposition from conservatives liberal democrats environmentalists and people living under the proposed flight path</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr johnsons contribution to the debate was to propose a brand new airport on an artificial island in the thames estuary purposebuilt and capable of operating around the clock</s>
<s>“boris island” was dismissed by the tory leadership as an expensive flight of fancy too far from london to attract business travellers without costly new transport links</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the mayor is not the type to give up easily</s>
<s>at the start of this year he produced a study calling for either a fourrunway hub airport on a new site in the estuary or increased capacity at existing airports nearby such as gatwick or stansted</s>
<s>mr johnson is a tory—but his proposals are explicitly opposed to his partys repeated assurances that no expansion of londons main airports is planned</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mayor argues that heathrow is falling behind continental airports</s>
<s>it serves just 185 destinations compared with over 200 from pariss charles de gaulle and 300 from frankfurt</s>
<s>a businessfriendly capital he says needs to make flying in and out more attractive</s>
<s>that means more capacity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr johnson has a point but his campaign is one part aviation and one part raw politics</s>
<s>he is thought to harbour leadership ambitions and if so must have his eye on a fight one day with mr osborne currently his most likely rival</s>
<s>the green conservatism espoused by david cameron has no deep roots in the party mr johnsons case for putting business first will resonate with many</s>
<s>mr osborne for his part is under pressure as chancellor to show that he has a recipe for restoring growth see economics focus</s>
<s>the mayor has been at pains to carve out a distinctive position on london and its interests pointing out an “aviationshaped hole” in government plans to boost the capital as an enterprise centre</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>city hall isnt remotely in a position to impose a new boris hub on the southeast but talking about it can create trouble for mr johnsons rival on the political runway</s>
<s>no doubt that has occurred to him</s>
