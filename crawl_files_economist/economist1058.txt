<s>residents of los taques on the west coast of venezuela’s paraguaná peninsula have long lived in the shadow of the world’s secondbiggest oil refinery</s>
<s>breezeblock homes back directly onto the refinery’s tank farm</s>
<s>many locals say that for several days in late august they noticed an unusual smell</s>
<s>it was “like a gas or something it hurt the nostrils and made us feel dizzy” said one ramón salas</s>
<s>shortly after 1am on august 25th he was woken by a huge explosion</s>
<s>the blast ripped off much of the roof of his home and blew out the windows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at least 42 people were killed and almost 100 injured</s>
<s>over 200 homes and a dozen businesses were severely damaged or destroyed</s>
<s>the barracks of the national guard troops charged with perimeter security was levelled killing at least 20 soldiers</s>
<s>so was a small plant bottling lubricating oil</s>
<s>it was the worst disaster in the history of petróleos de venezuela pdvsa the state oil monopoly and one of the worst refinery explosions ever</s>
<s>firefighters took more than three days to extinguish the blaze from storage tanks ignited by the blast</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the charged atmosphere six weeks before a presidential election recriminations were quick to follow</s>
<s>rafael ramírez who is both oil minister and pdvsa’s chairman blamed a gas leak</s>
<s>hugo chávez who is seeking a third consecutive sixyear term visited the scene and expressed sympathy for the victims</s>
<s>but he lashed out at critics who claimed that negligence was to blame</s>
<s>prochávez media commentators alleged sabotage planned by the opposition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>henrique capriles the opposition candidate offered support for the victims and called for unity</s>
<s>he also demanded an inquiry free from “politicking”</s>
<s>the communist party a chávez ally said union delegates should participate in the investigation</s>
<s>iván freites who leads the local oil workers’ union said the disaster could have been avoided he said the union had complained of damaged equipment leaks and lack of repairs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr ramírez who has run pdvsa since 2004 is one of mr chávez’s top aides and was recently confirmed in his post “for the next six years”</s>
<s>he has boasted of employing only chavistas</s>
<s>on his watch investment and maintenance have taken second place to the government’s appetite for oil revenue</s>
<s>last year pdvsa paid around $19 billion in tax royalties and dividends</s>
<s>it forked out twice as much to opaque funds run directly by the president and to welfare programmes</s>
<s>despite high oil prices pdvsa’s debt has risen to over $40 billion</s>
<s>in an earlier statement to parliament mr ramírez admitted that much essential maintenance had been postponed “owing to lack of parts”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the refinery disaster follows a gun battle inside yare prison on august 19th that left at least 26 inmates dead and the collapse four days earlier of a bridge linking caracas with eastern venezuela</s>
<s>will all this affect the election</s>
<s>some polls continue to show the president with a doubledigit lead but others make the race closer</s>
<s>what is clear is that mr capriles is gaining ground and the blast will not help mr chávez</s>
