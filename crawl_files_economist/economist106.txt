<s>the united states post office barely survived financial collapse in 2011</s>
<s>if it were a private business it would now be in bankruptcy</s>
<s>in 2012 it will sketch out either its own obsolescence or its transformation into something barely recognisable</s>
<s>when that happens the lettercarrier unions will fight and a few politicians will profess shock and indignation</s>
<s>but eventually congress will agree to end the post as it exists today for it has outlived its purpose</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the posts problems began four decades ago with politics</s>
<s>congress decided in 1970 to make it quasiindependent from the federal government giving it no more tax dollars but still forcing it to deliver to every address in america no matter how remote</s>
<s>a post office on the anaktuvuk pass in northern alaska is accessible only by aeroplane and serves 300 residents</s>
<s> thats about 150m addresses with another million or so added each year</s>
<s>so costs only go up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>america then refused to liberate the post as european and asian countries did so that it is still banned from using its offices more than the number of mcdonalds starbucks and walmart outlets combined to offer most kinds of banking insurance retailing and logistics</s>
<s>in 2006 congress limited the posts power to price stamps thus completing the fence around its nomansland between public and private</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then the market—ie american society—did the rest</s>
<s>the recession would have made mail volumes drop anyway</s>
<s>but it came at a time when americans were already accelerating their shift from sending pieces of paper to sending binary bits</s>
<s>mail volume is down by about 22 since its peak in 2006 and will keep falling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2000 hardly anybody paid his bills online ten years later more than half of americans did and soon everybody will</s>
<s>photos christmas cards magazines invitations—people under a certain age are wondering why on earth anybody ever sent anything in an envelope rather than via facebook email the ipad or the web</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such americans if they think of the post at all loathe it as they sort through the junk mail the misdelivered mail and then the unpleasant mail or as they queue sovietstyle in a post office for a passport application</s>
<s>for that is the posts last residual market the jury summonses government forms and other nasty effluents of american officialdom</s>
<s>fun stuff shows up electronically or by ups</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>americans who are old poor or rural do not see it that way of course</s>
<s>some have spotty access to the internet</s>
<s>for many the local post office is a souvenir of an america they like to remember</s>
<s>so the debate must first pass through halfmeasures and denial</s>
<s>congress will allow the post to fiddle with its pension and healthcare expenses and to lay off more employees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but in 2012 the debate will turn real</s>
<s>the post will be permitted to drop saturday delivery and eventually other deliveries as well perhaps even all regular schedules</s>
<s>as that becomes clear the customer defections will accelerate more as the last holdouts adjust</s>
<s>for instance it is finally becoming easy to sign and verify documents electronically so even bureaucracy will move online “go green” the press releases will say</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all for the better</s>
<s>as friedrich nietzsche said that which is falling should also be pushed</s>
<s>the posts days as a lettercarrying service are numbered</s>
<s>if it survives it will be as something different</s>
<s>recycle electronics vaccinate the population against epidemics</s>
<s>a physical infrastructure to reach all of america exists</s>
<s>in 2012 america will decide how much of it to keep and how to use it properly </s>
