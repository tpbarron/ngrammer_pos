<s>as an opposition tory leader anxious to throw off his party’s image as the home of rapacious gradgrinds david cameron made an eyecatching pledge in october 2009</s>
<s>“the third runway at heathrow is not going ahead no ifs no buts” he declared setting his party against labour’s plans for airport expansion</s>
<s>homeowners around london’s western fringe cheered</s>
<s>the move enhanced mr cameron’s green credentials—a key part of his strategy to reposition the conservative party as more socially aware</s>
<s>it also boosted the tories’ electoral prospects in marginal seats like richmond park and brentford which are already uncomfortably noisy see map</s>

<p>
<s>alas the days when making conservatism sound nice was a priority are long gone</s>
<s>as politicians return to westminster for a new term the prime minister is focused on the stubbornly lagging economy which is a drag on the coalition’s popularity and his own</s>
<s>backbenchers and businessfolk think they have a solution grant the capital’s main airport room to grow so the country can attract more business from china and other emerging economies</s>
<s>tim yeo tory chairman of parliament’s energy committee has changed his mind to favour a new runway and is loudly urging mr cameron to do likewise</s>
<s>powerful backers like sir michael spencer a city broker also support a uturn</s>

<p>
<s>few mps are convinced that building a new runway at heathrow would boost the economy quickly enough to make a difference to tory fortunes</s>
<s>but the cause has become a touchstone for those who want more technocratic government with a strong thatcherite tinge</s>
<s>their tone has become impolitic whether to expand airport capacity and how is being cast as an impatient test of the tory leader’s political manhood</s>
<s>in a daily telegraph article mr yeo asked if mr cameron was “man or mouse” never a helpful inquiry</s>
<s>in midaugust boris johnson london’s mayor who wants a big new airport in the thames estuary accused the government of “pussyfooting around”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet granting the heathrow expansionists their wish would be politically perilous</s>
<s>labour would now oppose it ed miliband is greener than his predecessor gordon brown as would the liberal democrats causing more instability in an already tetchy partnership</s>
<s>that thought has occurred to disputatious tories who would cheer if the coalition foundered</s>
<s>mr cameron though is loth to sacrifice his partnership with the lib dems at the whim of malcontents whose recipe for electoral success is mysterious</s>

<p>
<s>the prime minister is aware that nick clegg his coalition partner took a bashing after a reversal on university tuition fees and fears a uturn on heathrow would cause him similar problems</s>
<s>an adviser talks of the need to avoid a disastrous “splitscreen” moment when television can show the same politician saying directly opposed things at different times</s>
<s>and a shift in policy would bring other complications</s>
<s>justine greening the transport secretary stood in putney a constituency under the flightpath opposing the expansion of heathrow</s>
<s>moving her out of the job in a reshuffle of cabinet roles expected soon would look bad when there are few tory women in top jobs</s>
<s>mr cameron thus fervently wishes to hold off a decision until after the next election</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from edward heath in the 1970s to labour in the past decade leaders have tried to resolve london’s aviation dilemma</s>
<s>mr cameron is discovering that aeroplanes cause almost as much noise and disruption to the incumbent in downing street as they do to the residents of west london</s>
