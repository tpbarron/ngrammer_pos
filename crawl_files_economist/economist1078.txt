<s>the two main candidates have been in place for a while but only now is the race to be the next mayor of london taking shape</s>
<s>campaigning has begun for the contest in may 2012 westminster politicians are starting to take an interest</s>
<s>boris johnson the conservative incumbent is the narrow favourite to beat ken livingstone his labour predecessor who also ran the old greater london council in the 1980s</s>
<s>a yougov poll released on june 21st put mr johnson ahead by 48 to 41</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mayors chaotic charisma helps to compensate for his liabilities such as his unapologetic toryism in a leftleaning city and his links with an unloved central government</s>
<s>but there are deeper reasons for mr johnsons lead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if not spectacular his record is at least better than many expected of a politician who rarely shone as an mp</s>
<s>as well as the sort of small victories that are within the reach of the relatively weak mayoralty—a bicyclehire scheme the freezing of the local taxes claimed by city hall—he won a generous financial settlement for london from the treasury in last years spending review</s>
<s>as a result its transport network will continue to expand during an era of general austerity even as rival cities such as new york face cuts says tony travers of the london school of economics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>london has also weathered the recession much better than many economists anxious about the fate of the city predicted</s>
<s>far from suffering more than the country as a whole the capital experienced a smaller rise in unemployment than britain generally according to official statistics</s>
<s>house prices in london have also recovered faster than those in any other region</s>
<s>even if mr johnson cannot claim much credit for that economic resilience it should help him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of this means that mr livingstone is doomed</s>
<s>of serving politicians perhaps only george osborne the chancellor of the exchequer and alex salmond scotlands first minister rival him for sheer wiliness</s>
<s>his attacks on mr johnsons failure to avert strikes by tube drivers could resonate voters might recall mr livingstones knack for doing deals with the unions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and mr livingstone is keenly aware of his perceived indifference to the citys outskirts having lost in 2008 to mr johnsons “doughnut” strategy which targeted suburban voters he is campaigning assiduously in those areas</s>
<s>still a 66yearold hoping to run london a youthful city for a third time probably needs a big new idea—like the congestion charge mr livingstone implemented as mayor—to avoid looking like yesterdays man</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>westminsters interest in the race is understandable it is rich with implications for national politics</s>
<s>defeat for mr johnson would be a midterm blow to david cameron victory would encourage the idea that the mayor could succeed him as tory leader a goal that mr johnson sometimes seems to be pursuing</s>
<s>as for mr livingstone the prospect of a vituperative leftwinger being one of the most prominent labour politicians during the race and possibly beyond alarms some in the party</s>
<s>but were he to lose the sense that labour is failing to make headway under ed miliband its beleaguered leader will grow</s>
