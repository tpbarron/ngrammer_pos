<s>airports faced disruption from a walkout of border staff university lecturers were joining them</s>

<s>could and should it</s>
<s>at present there is no minimum turnout for strike ballots meaning that stoppages can go ahead based on the votes of relatively small numbers</s>
<s>only 20 of those eligible to vote in the ballot held by the public and commercial services union which represents civil servants supported the walkout the figure for the national union of teachers was 37</s>
<s>the cbi an employers body thinks at least 40 of the eligible workforce should vote for a strike before it is approved</s>

<s>formally britain still has strict strike laws</s>
<s>there is no enshrined right to down tools as there is in france and italy</s>
<s>in practice the situation is a muddle</s>
<s>in particular some public servants with essential duties such as firefighters may strike the police and the armed forces may not</s>
<s>ditto prison officers—but they sometimes do anyway</s>
<s>employers use temporary injunctions and legal challenges to buy negotiating time when strikes loom</s>

<s>other countries including new democracies such as poland and latvia have introduced minimum turnout requirements for strike ballots</s>
<s>france has a “minimumservice law” to ensure schools stay open and skeleton transport services operate during walkouts</s>
<s>under these arrangements transport companies for example are obliged to use all possible means to keep passengers moving—or refund them</s>
<s>any resulting cost can at least in theory be recouped from the government partfunded by the docked wages of strikers</s>
<s>the institute of economic affairs a promarket thinktank recommends a shift away from national pay bargaining to locally negotiated agreements taking local economic circumstances into account which would reduce the power of national unions</s>

<s>so far appetite for radical change seems scant among ministers</s>
<s>david cameron has ringingly declared the strikes “wrong” but not responded to calls for tighter legislation</s>
<s>that is partly because he wants to avoid appearing hellbent on strife</s>
<s>but the restrained stance has practical as well as political motives</s>
<s>a requirement for a minimum turnout in votes for industrial action would make unions work harder to boost participation in ballots and thus increase their propaganda effort</s>
<s>employers would do likewise says simon ost a lawyer specialising in industrial disputes “the respective positions would most likely become more entrenched making disputes more difficult to resolve”</s>

<s>still this may only be the start of a summer of trouble</s>
<s>bullish trade union bosses long on the sidelines of public life are back in the news</s>
<s>keeping the temperature of the conflict down might be rational</s>
<s>that doesnt mean it will be possible</s>
