<s>money as cicero observed more than two millennia ago is the sinews of war</s>
<s>that is still true today</s>
<s>but lately from the american point of view things have got ridiculous</s>
<s>guided missiles in particular are ludicrously expensive</s>
<s>a tomahawk cruise missile costs about $15m and even the hellfire an airtoground rocket that weighs a mere 50kg is $115000 a pop</s>
<s>in exchange for say an enemy tank that is probably a fair price to pay</s>
<s>to knock out a pickup truck crewed by a few lightly armed guerrillas however it seems a little expensive and using its shoulderfired cousin the javelin $147000 to kill individual soldiers in foxholes as is often the case in afghanistan is positively profligate</s>
<s>clearly something has to change</s>
<s>and changing it is</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an early sign of this change came in march with the deployment in afghanistan of the apkws ii advanced precision kill weapons system made by bae systems</s>
<s>the apkws ii is a smart version of the oldfashioned 70mm 275inch rocket which has been used by america’s armed forces since 1948</s>
<s>it is also cheap as guided missiles go costing $28000 a shot</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the apkws ii is loaded and fired in the same way pictured above as its unguided predecessors from the same 19round pods making its use straightforward</s>
<s>the difference is that it can strike with an accuracy of one metre because it has been fitted with a laserseeking head which follows a beam pointed at the target by the missile’s operators</s>
<s>this controls a set of fins that can steer the missile to its destination</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>standard practice with unguided 70mm missiles is to use as many as two pods’ worth ie 38 rockets at $1000 a round to blanket a target</s>
<s>that means the apkws ii comes in at threequarters of the cost per kill</s>
<s>it also means that many more targets can be attacked on a single mission</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>guide price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bae is merely the first to market with this sort of device</s>
<s>atk lockheed martin and raytheon are all close behind</s>
<s>meanwhile the american navy has been working on its own cheap guided missile the lowcost imaging terminal seeker lcits which it tested successfully last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the lcits is another upgraded 70mm weapon but instead of laser guidance it picks out its targets by their heat signature</s>
<s>because the operators do not need to keep pointing a laser at the target they can fire several missiles in quick succession—a useful feature if a ship is being attacked by a swarm of boats</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>smaller precision weapons are useful too in circumstances where weight is a crucial factor</s>
<s>shadow a drone used by the american australian and swedish armies is too light to be able to carry hellfires and is thus at the moment restricted to reconnaissance duties</s>
<s>but not for much longer</s>
<s>shadows are now being armed with a small stillclassified guided missile</s>
<s>this follows the earlier success of arming hunter drones with viper strike a laserguided glide bomb weighing 20kg originally developed by northrop grumman as an antitank weapon and now owned by mbda</s>
<s>viper strike along with raytheon’s griffin a similar weapon also arms the marines’ harvest hawk an aerial gunship based on the hercules transport aircraft</s>
<s>viper strike means these aircraft are capable of hitting a large number of targets with great precision from a distance of several kilometres</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the most determined effort to develop a small cheap guided weapon though is the forward firing miniature munition f2m2 or spike missile from the naval air weapons station in china lake california</s>
<s>steve felix the f2m2’s project manager wanted to make such a weapon for just $5000 using offtheshelf components</s>
<s>the result which weighs less than 3kg and is the size of a baguette is claimed to be the world’s smallest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spike has been tested successfully as a shoulderlaunched missile and also fired from drones</s>
<s>it has an ingenious opticalguidance system—a camera that can either lock on to an operatordesignated object or can pick up a laser spot and home in on it</s>
<s>it has a range of 1500 metres and though the warhead is too small to damage a tank it can destroy cars and other light targets far more cheaply than the alternatives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>precision weapons have already changed warfare radically even though they have sometimes raised the price of battle</s>
<s>lowcost guided missiles often carried on small drones rather than expensive piloted aircraft will change it further still</s>
<s>when such missiles cost a thousand dollars rather than a million no target will be too cheap to engage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>correction this article has been updated</s>
<s>we misquoted the price of apkws ii as $18000 in the previous version</s>
<s>also the system is manufactured purely by bae not by them in partnership with northrop grumman</s>
<s>apologies</s>
