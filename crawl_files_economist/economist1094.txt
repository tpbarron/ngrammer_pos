<s>anyone caught up in recent months in the maelstrom of piccadilly and pall mall—west end thoroughfares whose traffic flow has been subject to a noisy protracted redesign—might be forgiven for thinking that london is the world capital of roadworks</s>
<s>comparative statistics are hard to come by but there might be something in that hunch</s>
<s>about half a million roadworks pock the citys streets each year creating 30 of all traffic disruptions and costing about £1 billion a year on a conservative estimate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the explanation for the pain is partly historic</s>
<s>after the destruction of the second world war some european cities were replanned to accommodate mass carownership</s>
<s>london came through the blitz but kept its mazelike medieval road pattern</s>
<s>meanwhile other bits of the citys infrastructure are similarly decrepit its water pipes are antique its sewage network is victorian</s>
<s>so improvements are both frequent and peculiarly disruptive</s>

<s>boris johnson londons mayor has a plan</s>
<s>in 2009 he introduced a voluntary code of conduct to which six big utility firms have signed up along with transport for london tfl the citys transport authority</s>
<s>tfl controls 5 of the citys roads but those have nearly 10 of all roadworks and a third of all traffic</s>
<s>the rest are supervised by the city of london corporation and the 32 boroughs</s>
<s> the code promotes offpeak work the coordination of plans and covering up of holes so cars can drive over them</s>
<s>in the two years of its operation tfl reckons that more than 2000 days of disruption have been avoided by encouraging utilities to make their upgrades to the same streets at the same time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mayor has also created a paidfor permit system—similar to one used in new york city—which lets local authorities limit the number of works on their turf and hand out penalties for violating the permits conditions previously utilities could simply issue work notices and expect drivers to make way</s>
<s>and tfl has also imposed a cap on the number of roadworks that can happen on its own grid at any one time it says the number and average duration of works on it are decreasing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>alas there are still big glitches</s>
<s>boroughs commission their own roadworks and have less incentive than utilities to work efficiently</s>
<s>budget cuts mean upgrades tend to be delayed until they are unavoidable—at which point they are more troublesome than planned maintenance</s>
<s>utilities may pass on the costs of permits to consumers</s>
<s>the same might go for the costs of mr johnsons latest proposal a lanerental scheme for tfls most congested streets</s>
<s>if implemented that would allow the authority to charge a hefty daily fee for the use of road space at busy times</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is another basic problem with londons roads</s>
<s>as tony travers of the london school of economics points out londoners expect too much from them</s>
<s>responding to residents concerns councils have diverted traffic away from smaller streets so the big arterial roads are overburdened—with bus and bicycle lanes and widening footpaths as well as more cars</s>
<s>adding such features inflicts triple pain on drivers mr travers argues</s>
<s>the men in hard hats do their bit then streets have less space for cars consequently further roadworks are more disruptive when they happen</s>
<s>until london decides what it wants its roads to do mr johnsons measures will only offer limited lubrication</s>
