<s>the red routemaster bus is one of londons abiding icons its curvaceous silhouette as recognisable as big ben</s>
<s>the 50yearold design was pensioned off in 2005 but in january next year a new doubledecker with a hopon hopoff platform inspired by the routemaster will appear on the capitals streets</s>
<s>at least a few of them will</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>other classic vehicle designs such as the mini and the beetle have been updated for the modern age</s>
<s>like those new models the newfangled bus is bigger than the original and combines nostalgia with nifty technology it uses 40 less fuel than its dieselguzzling equivalents and 15 less than recent hybrid doubledeckers</s>
<s>it will be made—mostly—in britain</s>
<s>in this case however the impetus for the reinvention came not from consumer fancy but a fraught political battle</s>

<s>ken livingstone labour mayor from 2000 to 2008 championed bus travel which is now at its highest in london in 50 years there were 60 more passengers in 201011 than in 200001</s>
<s>he also introduced 18metrelong “bendy” singledeckers</s>
<s>though these carry more people and are faster to board they are not universally loved</s>
<s>contesting the mayoral election in 2008 boris johnson the conservative candidate above swore to cleanse the capital of the blight of bendy buses</s>
<s>he won and by the end of 2011 all 396 bendy members of the 7500 fleet will be purged—in time for next years mayoral election at which his opponent will be mr livingstone</s>

<p>
<s>the revival of something that combined beauty with utility might well prove popular</s>
<s>but popularity can be expensive</s>
<s>as well as retiring healthy buses transport for london tfl which oversees most of the capitals transit systems is paying £78m to produce just six prototypes a conventional doubledecker costs £315000</s>
<s>the additional crew member who will staff the open deck might prove an expensive luxury in austere times</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if more orders follow and the modern routemaster is still ferrying passengers in 40 years time the new bus could be a lasting legacy for mr johnson</s>
<s>if not it will be an expensive red elephant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr johnson is also taking a bet on the libertarianism of voters over a nannying healthandsafety culture</s>
<s>by day passengers will be able to hurl themselves out of the rear entrance even when the bus is moving all doors will be closed at night</s>
<s>daniel moylan of tfl says it and the mayors office have “no concerns” about safety people can be trusted to behave sensibly he reckons</s>
<s>that really is a political idea that could go places</s>
