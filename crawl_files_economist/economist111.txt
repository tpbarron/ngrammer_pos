<s>arguments about austerity have taken on an almost religious fervour</s>
<s>to some—such as wolfgang schäuble germany’s finance minister or george osborne his british counterpart—tough fiscal policy is the cure for excessive debt and any easing risks betraying a confidencesapping loss of resolve</s>
<s>to others today’s austerity is selfdefeating</s>
<s>trying to cut deficits when economies are weak will lead to stagnation they say and even bigger debt burdens</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>emotions run high and both sides treat evidence sloppily</s>
<s>foes of austerity pounced on a recent analysis by the imf which suggested that the economic impact of fiscal tightening in europe had been worse than expected</s>
<s>austerity advocates immediately queried the fund’s regressions see article</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet it is wrong to caricature austerity as good or bad</s>
<s>austerity has hurt growth more than its proponents expected</s>
<s>but for many countries it has been less avoidable than its critics acknowledge</s>
<s>in most places the question is not whether to cut deficits but how to cut them wisely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>start with the relationship between austerity and growth</s>
<s>the argument that budget cuts might boost growth common two years ago has been discredited</s>
<s>austerity can be expansionary if it leads to a sharp drop in interest rates but that is not the case today</s>
<s>many countries are all cutting at once even as many households try to reduce their debts</s>
<s>nominal interest rates in many places are close to zero</s>
<s>under these circumstances budget cuts will damage demand more than usual</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however this does not mean that the focus on fiscal consolidation was misguided</s>
<s>many of the countries that have suffered the biggest budget squeezes particularly in the euro zone’s periphery had no choice</s>
<s>investors were shunning their bonds and their european rescuers were unwilling to cough up more funds</s>
<s>other countries such as britain with gaping structural deficits reasonably feared a similar fate</s>
<s>the fact that bond yields are now at historic lows does not mean it was foolish to chart a course towards balancing budgets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what matters is how austerity is imposed and what other policies accompany it</s>
<s>the experience of the past couple of years argues against sudden sharp cuts and especially against tightening more when the economy turns out weaker than expected</s>
<s>better to have a mediumterm plan which gradually reduces underlying deficits</s>
<s>as for other policies the main lesson is that austerity hurts more if it is not accompanied by bold monetary loosening</s>
<s>it has hurt the most in the euro zone’s periphery where cuts were heavy and hurried and the european central bank ecb did little to counter them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a surplus of enthusiasm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>happily despite mr schäuble’s macho rhetoric the pace of tightening in the euro zone is slowing</s>
<s>on current plans there will be budget cuts equivalent to about 1 of gdp in 2013 less than this year</s>
<s>politicians are focusing more on structural deficit figures than headline ones</s>
<s>they are giving the wobbliest economies such as greece and portugal more time</s>
<s>it is not yet enough</s>
<s>portugal’s budget is still too harsh spain’s targets are implausible see article and the ecb should loosen more</s>
<s>but eurozone fiscal policy is heading the right way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the main risks are now elsewhere</s>
<s>in britain mr osborne still clings to a misguided target that britain’s ratio of debt to gdp should be falling by 2015</s>
<s>that would require doubling down on austerity</s>
<s>in america an even bigger mess threatens</s>
<s>a “fiscal cliff” of sudden severe tax increases and spending cuts looms at the end of this year</s>
<s>unless congress acts america will plunge into recession</s>
<s>to avoid such woes the world needs fiscal policy driven not by faith but by reason</s>
