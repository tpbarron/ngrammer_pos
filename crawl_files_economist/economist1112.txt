<s>once the worlds largest port londons docklands had become so desolate by the 1980s that stanley kubrick used them as a backdrop for his vietnam war film “full metal jacket”</s>
<s>thanks to government investment and private enterprise the area is now a shimmering success story</s>
<s>canary wharf a skyscraper cluster hosts bankers from around the world</s>
<s>city airport opened in 1987 is the easy option for business travel to the continent</s>
<s>the docklands light railway and an extension of the tube have connected the area to the heart of the capital</s>
<s>the oncederided millennium dome is now the busiest music venue in the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the docklands are a monument to what could be called londonism</s>
<s>since the creation of the capitals mayoralty in 2000 a distinct ideology has congealed around that office</s>
<s>some of it is recognisably rightwing it embraces high finance even during the bankerbashing furore</s>
<s>some of it is conventionally leftwing londonism calls for state spending on infrastructure and a liberal line on immigration</s>
<s>essentially it is a commitment to relentless growth and openness</s>
<s>the city long ago made the transition from mere capital to global hub</s>
<s>now it has a political philosophy to match</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the two men who have held the mayoralty so far—who are also the main candidates for the mayoral election next year—have been londonists</s>
<s>labours “red” ken livingstone who ran the city until 2008 was actually pragmatic about capitalism</s>
<s>he approved private developments and enjoyed surprisingly good relations with the city</s>
<s>at the same time he used his bully pulpit to ask whitehall for infrastructure money and an open immigration policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his successor the conservative boris johnson pictured has been similarly heterodox</s>
<s>mr johnson has publicly deplored the new 50 top rate of income tax introduced by the previous labour government and retained by the conservativeliberal democrat coalition which he fears will repel wealthcreators</s>
<s>he bashes those who bash bankers pointing to the jobs that the financial sector creates and the tax revenues it generates</s>
<s>he successfully hounded the government to go ahead with crossrail a new eastwest underground train system for the city though mr livingstone can claim most of the credit for the project</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some suspect mr johnson of positioning himself to replace david cameron the prime minister as tory leader one day</s>
<s>mr johnson is palpably ambitious but some of his views seem likely to alienate the tory grassroots for example he complains loudly that the governments restrictions on immigration risk limiting londons access to foreign talent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>city state</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are important differences between the ways mr johnson and mr livingstone have approached the mayoralty</s>
<s>confronted by the lack of independent fiscal levers at the mayors disposal mr livingstone saw economic growth as a way of achieving redistribution by other means</s>
<s>he adeptly used planning laws to encourage projects that included affordable housing transport upgrades and other social goods</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the coming electoral clash between the two will emphasise their differences</s>
<s>but whatever its outcome londonism has become a selfreinforcing ideology that will probably outlive both mens careers</s>
<s>the more open and multifarious the city becomes the more it attracts people who want it to stay that way</s>
<s>“london” says tony travers of the london school of economics “increasingly defines itself by having moved a step farther along the path of cosmopolitanism than anywhere else on the planet” the most interesting aspect of the citys bid for the 2012 olympics was not its victory but the nature of its campaign which sold london as the ultimate global city rather than a british one</s>

<p>
<s>although many major cities aspire to growth and globalism london has an easier time achieving both than its western rivals</s>
<s>its location is an obvious advantage over new york</s>
<s>europe is on its doorstep beijing is not that much farther away than wall street time differences allow london to do business with both in the same day</s>
<s>then there is its own geography it is easier for diverse lifestyles to coexist in a sprawling city of distinct villages than in a relatively concentrated metropolis such as either new york or paris</s>
<s>the latter is also hamstrung by its beauty daring new developments have a tougher time getting approved than in hotchpotch london</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course londonism carries risks</s>
<s>mass immigration has caused some social friction in the outskirts—though for the most part the city remains strikingly unsegregated</s>
<s>a laissezfaire approach to lifestyles can be taken too far</s>
<s>london has been an alarmingly relaxed harbour for extremists as mayor mr livingstone hosted yusuf alqaradawi a controversial cleric</s>
<s>the financial crash brought home the downside of a vast banking sector</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then there is the challenge of onecity dominance</s>
<s>national politicians oscillate between a zeal to prop up britains regions and a resigned acceptance that scarce investment must go to its behemoth of a capital</s>
<s>the latter has been winning of late hence crossrail the highspeed connection to the continent and the upgrades of londons bus and tube networks</s>
<s>a bicycle rental scheme—conceived by mr livingstone implemented by mr johnson—is just the most eyecatching of the citys recent transport improvements</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is a cultural divide too</s>
<s>before the financial crisis londonism seemed indistinguishable from a broader british take on the world freewheeling relaxed about globalisation</s>
<s>the overall british view has now soured while londons remains outwardlooking</s>
<s>londonism seems more sensible in a world in which britain cannot be too picky about how it earns its living and dynamic people will be warmly welcomed elsewhere</s>
<s>it is a fittingly mongrel ideology for the cosmopolis</s>
