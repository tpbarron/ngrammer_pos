<s>the composer has just heard that he has won a coveted award worth $350000 and is celebrating in his own distinctive way with colleagues at the wissenschaftskolleg a sabbatical haven for artists and scholars in the leafy western suburbs of berlin</s>
<s>other modern composers mindful of the precariousness of their work might give in to a moment or two of untrammelled joy</s>
<s>but gyorgy ligeti sounds glum</s>
<s>money and commerce he believes are ruining art and he thinks that a littleheard russian composer whom he particularly admires galina ustvolskaya deserved the prize more</s>
<s>propounding what he calls ligetis law he says “artists who become famous are no good because they have no time to be good”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as notes towards an acceptance speech this sounds less than grateful</s>
<s>but mr ligeti is speaking with characteristic irony</s>
<s>when you hear him talk as when you listen to his music you soon learn to recognise microshades of mood and meaning</s>
<s>behind the grumpiest of his remarks there is the trace of a smile though hardly an innocent one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for a composer of mainly “abstract” music—work that doesnt tell a story but is listened to for itself—his life has been cut through with history</s>
<s>he was born 78 years ago to a hungarian family in the large swathe of transylvania awarded to romania after 1918</s>
<s>he wanted to be a scientist but the jewish quota in university science places was full</s>
<s>against the wishes of his parents who kept him from the piano until he was 14 he took up music first at cluj and then in budapest which he reached on foot</s>
<s>in the second world war his father and a brother vanished in nazi camps</s>
<s>he himself lived under communism in budapest until the failed uprising of 1956 when he fled to austria</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unlike other prominent composers of his generation—pierre boulez and karlheinz stockhausen come to mind—recognition for mr ligeti came late</s>
<s>stanley kubrick who was always ahead of the crowd used his music in the 1968 film “2001 a space odyssey”</s>
<s> on leaving hungary he worked with mr stockhausen on electronic music but soon abandoned it preferring to plunder the worlds stock of existing instruments—ocarinas and gamelan fiddles for example as well as piccolos and violins—to find strange and beautiful new sounds</s>
<s>he is equally piratical with the worlds musical styles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the early 1960s he composed a symphonic poem for 100 metronomes it sounds like blind men applauding with their canes which run down for 19 minutes until only one is left</s>
<s>nowadays he laughes this off as a provocative joke</s>
<s>but humour of a subtler kind and a taste for surprise have never left him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when you first hear mr ligetis music it can sound frozen or static as if not going anywhere</s>
<s>but unlike many minimalist compositions—a label wrongly applied to his work—it is not repetitious</s>
<s>it changes slowly with surprising results as do certain mathematical expansions</s>
<s>he loves dynamic extremes a passage in his 1966 cello concerto is marked ppppppppand unusual rhythms and tempos</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the least doctrinaire of composers mr ligeti has said he has no message and is always ready to change his musical language</s>
<s>he has tried serialism tone clusters and conventional chords unconventionally arranged</s>
<s>he has tuned violins in odd ways and explored tiny intervals of sound</s>
<s>when a ligeti festival was held on londons south bank in 1997 it was called suitably “clocks and clouds”</s>
<s>for a less gifted mind such an unbounded menu of sound could so easily produce chaos</s>
<s>but mr ligeti has a natural fluency and a lyric gift that makes it difficult for him to write a boring passage or an ugly bar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his musical judgments about others are fierce and unexpected and he delivers them with mischievous certitude conlon nancarrow is the most original of composers since stravinsky and bartok carlo gesualdo a 16thcentury neapolitan count is one of the greatest composers ever reinbert de leeuw is among the very best of contemporary conductors</s>
<s>mr ligeti you suspect knows perfectly well that many of us will be gasping who</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by contrast there is nothing playful or ironic when mr ligeti talks about performances of his own music</s>
<s>when sony began to issue cds of all his work he approved of the “etudes” and “musica ricercata” played by pierrelaurent aimard his favourite among players of his piano work sk 62308 and he liked also the chamber music disc sk 62309</s>
<s>but he was scathing about the recordings of his orchestral work and he has fought sony in court successfully so far to prevent their release</s>
<s>his preferred conductor mr de leeuw appears on the first of a new ligeti project for teldec 8573839532</s>
<s>this includes the lovely “melodien” 1971 as good an introduction to his music as you could want and one which mr ligeti himself prefers to the moreoftenplayed “lontano”</s>
<s>the teldec label is now owned by aol time warner and to mr ligetis regret disbanded in all but name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>frugal and disciplined in manner mr ligeti lives for his music</s>
<s>his clothes look as if they were bought at jumble sales</s>
<s>his trademark missoni jerseys with their repeating patterns are gifts from wellwishers</s>
<s>he has spent most of his days in berlin in his bare room with only a few books</s>
<s>there is not even a computer</s>
<s>pushing down a key and having a note appear on the screen he finds is too quick and too mechanical</s>
<s>all he needs is a pencil and eraser with a piano nearby</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at lunches in the wissenschaftskolleg mr ligeti has been a star engaging voraciously in conversation with all comers on almost any subject in one of six and a half languages romanian hungarian german french english swedish with a musicians italian counting as half</s>
<s>mostly he prefers to talk about science</s>
<s>he is a friend of benoît mandelbrot a founder of fractal geometry—the study of figures generated by successive simple operations such as division—whom mr ligeti sought out after concluding that he had been using fractal patterns in his music for years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a mathematician manqué mr ligeti likes to say “i am not a musician i am a scientist” this is not simply a boutade for he takes an unfashionably objective view of his work one in which communication seems to play little part</s>
<s>at a lunchtime setto recently about who it is that artists create for one person mentioned that their poethusband wrote for 30 people who could understand his work</s>
<s>someone else cited an artist who worked strictly for herself</s>
<s>mr ligeti cut in “i create neither for an audience nor for myself</s>
<s>i create for solutions” luckily more and more of us can hear how right his solutions sound</s>
