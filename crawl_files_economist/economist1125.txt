<s>even as the dining room smouldered soldiers moved about taking fingerprints and scanning eyes of the corpses of taliban fighters</s>
<s>the ghoulish ritual followed an attack on june 21st on a restaurant beside qargha lake in kabul</s>
<s>after the scans the information was compared with a biometric database</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gathering such data even from the dead is now standard practice in the afghan war</s>
<s>soldiers learn that usable scans can be harvested as late as six hours after death depending on the heat</s>
<s>investigators were confident of finding a match at qargha lake and did so</s>
<s>their success underlines the growth of the database and the ambition of those behind it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in this case an unnamed suicidebomber had been scanned two years earlier in logar province because he was looking suspicious said lieutenantcolonel mohammad anwar muniri who leads the afghan programme</s>
<s>however he was not detained</s>
<s>a list of “martyrs” released by the taliban after the attack in kabul confirmed he was from that province</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his details could equally have got into the database in other ways</s>
<s>few of afghanistans 30m people have a birth certificate a second name or can read</s>
<s>yet americas army and the afghan government have collected digital records of more than 25m of them</s>
<s>anyone arrested or imprisoned or who seeks to join the army or police is scanned</s>
<s>so are those such as labourers who attempt to get into a coalition military base</s>
<s>each is checked against watchlists of suspects</s>
<s>last year biometric machines were also put at all border crossings</s>
<s>in hotly contested areas any “fightingage males” meaning those between 15 and 70 may be scanned compulsorily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some patrols call all men from a village out of their homes and line them up by a mosque to be logged</s>
<s>at other times buses are stopped arbitrarily and all the men are taken off and scanned</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>elsewhere such intrusions would have caused an outcry</s>
<s>but few afghans so far have protested</s>
<s>american officers praise the technology as a helpful counterinsurgency tool if opponents can be identified they can be separated from the wider lawabiding populace</s>
<s>they cite examples of its usefulness</s>
<s>nearly 500 taliban prisoners tunnelled out of kandahars sarposa prison last year but they had previously all been scanned</s>
<s>within a month 30 had been recaptured because of random biometric checks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the data are passed on beyond afghanistan to americas army the fbi and the department of homeland security</s>
<s>agreements to share data exist with dozens of allied countries</s>
<s>american soldiers in ghazni once described scanning a dead insurgent then two days later getting a call from the cia to say that his record matched someone first scanned in iraq</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet as the system grows so do worries about it</s>
<s>it is involuntary and shrouded in secrecy</s>
<s>it is easy to come across afghans who claim that they were wrongly denied foreign visas or jobs after a biometric scan flagged up their presence on some watchlist</s>
<s>evidence held against them is rarely divulged nor is it clear how they can challenge it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“there is a vetting process to be put on a watchlist” says sergeantmajor robert haemmerle of the american armys afghanistan biometrics programme</s>
<s>“its not just a matter of ‘i dont like this guy</s>
<s>there is a deliberate policy and process to ensure that peoples rights are respected that its not abused”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet those policies and processes are kept classified by nato and americas defence department</s>
<s>jennifer lynch a lawyer at the electronic frontier foundation a group based in san francisco that keeps a watch on how digital technology encroaches on civil freedoms also questions the quality of the data</s>
<s>she fears that scans done quickly in the field or by inexperienced technicians could lead to cases of mistaken identity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neither afghan nor american officials have described their ultimate plans for the project nor whether they want to log the whole population</s>
<s>talk of a new national identity card has fallen quiet</s>
<s>but the more people who are scanned the more powerful the database becomes</s>
