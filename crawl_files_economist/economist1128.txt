<s>like miners panning for gold numbercrunchers love the stockmarket</s>
<s>there are thousands of different securities prices to analyse decadesworth of data to dissect</s>
<s>academics can make their reputation by discovering an anomaly in prices such as smaller companies outperforming the index over the long term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but are these anomalies a route to riches or the equivalent of iron pyrite “fool’s gold”</s>
<s>they may just be data quirks—what statisticians call “noise”</s>
<s>another possibility is that investors read the academic papers and then go into the market to take advantage of the anomaly</s>
<s>if so as they buy the “cheap” stocks and sell the “expensive” ones the discrepancy should gradually disappear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the answer may be found in yes another academic paper</s>
<s>the authors looked at 82 separate anomalies discovered by academics and examined the returns from the suggested strategy both before and after publication</s>
<s>they find that investors can still earn excess returns after publication but that these returns fall by around a third</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the decline is probably caused by investor activity trading volumes in shares related to the anomalies tend to increase after academics have revealed them</s>
<s>but why don’t the anomalies disappear altogether</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason may be constraints on investor behaviour</s>
<s>some strategies require investors to go short bet on falling prices or use borrowed money pension funds and mutual funds are unable to do so</s>
<s>another reason may be that trading costs reduce the scope for profits</s>
<s>anomalies disappear more quickly if the stocks involved are large and liquid and thus less costly to trade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if their discoveries cannot be traded on finance professors will keep mining the data</s>
<s>as well as the academic kudos involved in finding an anomaly their insights might just land them a job at a hedge fund</s>
<s>trading a university salary for a share of a fund’s performance fee is a really attractive example of profitable arbitrage</s>
