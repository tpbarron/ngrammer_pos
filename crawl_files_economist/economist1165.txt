<s>his appointment in late 2011 to succeed a frenchman jeanclaude trichet nearly didnt happen</s>
<s>at the 11th hour frances president nicolas sarkozy threatened to block the deal unless another italian on the ecb board agreed to make way for a frenchman since the departure of mr trichet left france unrepresented</s>
<s>this is not just petty politics greek default would threaten some big french banks</s>
