<s>american presidents have had cadillacs or lincolns as official limousines since franklin roosevelt who had one of each—his cadillac was a bulletproof one confiscated from al capone</s>
<s>but despite recent attempts to revive them the two luxury brands best years are distant dots in their rearview mirrors</s>
<s>in 1990 around 250000 of each brand were sold</s>
<s>last year gm sold 152390 cadillacs up almost 4 on 2010 while fords sales of lincolns slipped a bit to just 85643</s>

<s>cadillac got into websters dictionary as a synonym for “the best” but for years now more american buyers have reckoned that a bmw mercedes or lexus is better</s>
<s>european motorists have spurned gms decadeslong efforts to interest them in cadillacs</s>
<s>however if there is one place that now has lots of rich people who appreciate big blingy getouttamyway motors it is china</s>
<s>that is why gm is about to start producing its new cadillac xts pictured a big sedan to compete with bmws 7series in a factory in shanghai</s>
<s>later this year cadillac will launch another new model on the chinese market the sporty ats a rival to bmws 3series</s>

<s>chinas new rich are gorging on luxury see article</s>
<s>last year they bought about 30000 cadillacs up 73 from 2010 although bmw was way ahead with chinese sales of 217000</s>
<s>just as chinese sales revived the midmarket buick brand gms plan is that cadillacs increasing success there will improve that brands economies of scale allowing it to invest in a broader more lavishly equipped range</s>
<s>speaking at the beijing motor show last month gms boss dan akerson promised to follow the xts and ats with at least one new product a year and talked of selling 180000 caddys annually in china within five years</s>

<s>if cadillac is belatedly joining its european rivals in the chinese gold rush where is lincoln</s>
<s>it did not have a single car at the beijing show</s>
<s>ford executives said they needed to concentrate on reviving the brand in america before they could consider launching it elsewhere</s>
<s>but lincolns weak sales at home have brought back speculation that ford might scrap the brand altogether</s>
<s>its fate may hang on the success of a new version of its mkz model to be launched next year</s>
<s>its designer max wolff persuaded ford executives to go for a radical restyling</s>
<s>the new car has a retractable allglass roof and the classic lincoln “waterfall” front grille has been stretched into something mr wolff compares to an eagles open wings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reviving a car brand whose average buyer is 65 years old will not be easy</s>
<s>fords modest hope for the mkz is to bring that average down to ooh 57</s>
<s>joe philippi of auto trends consulting worries that whereas cadillac seems to be heading back to the right road lincoln may have slipped off the map entirely</s>
<s>it is not yet clear whether lincoln will soon be soaring like an eagle once more or whether it will just limp on like a lame duck</s>
