<s>in an average month 108000 people are killed in traffic accidents around the world and the death toll is increasing</s>
<s>on current trends it will exceed 150000 people a month by 2020 according to the world health organisation as cars become more widespread in developing countries increasing the number of vehicles on the world’s roads from around 1 billion in 2010 to 2 billion</s>
<s>many lives will be spared by outfitting more vehicles with airbags the biggest lifesavers in car technology since seat belts</s>
<s>but now a far greater revolution in road safety is within reach</s>
<s>around 90 of accidents are caused by human error</s>
<s>design vehicles so that they can drive themselves goes the theory and death tolls will plummet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>driverless cars would provide further benefits beyond safety</s>
<s>they could coordinate their routes and travel in close formation increasing the capacity of road networks reducing congestion and saving fuel</s>
<s>they would be able to drop someone off and then go and park themselves</s>
<s>they might even usher in an era of widespread carsharing with vehicles dispatched on demand to people who need them rather than spending most of the day sitting idle by the side of the road</s>
<s>and they would of course do away with the stress of driving allowing their occupants to read browse the internet or take a nap</s>
<s>it may sound like science fiction but much of the technology needed to turn ordinary vehicles into selfdriving ones already exists</s>
<s>indeed almost all carmakers are developing sensors control systems and other equipment that turns cars in effect into autonomous robots</s>
<s>prototypes are on the roads today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thilo koslowski an analyst at gartner a marketresearch firm predicts that such vehicles will be on sale within eight years</s>
<s>erik coelingh a senior engineer for “driver support” systems at volvo a swedish carmaker reckons it will take at least ten</s>
<s>however long it takes the transition will be gradual</s>
<s>before fully autonomous vehicles arrive humans will remain behind the wheel gradually handing off more and more of the job of driving to an autopilot</s>
<s>owners of cars with advanced driverassistance features have already embarked on this transition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just around the corner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the late 1990s some cars have had the option of “adaptive” cruise control that uses a radar system to monitor the position of the car in front and accelerates or brakes automatically</s>
<s>general motors america’s biggest carmaker is designing a “super cruise” option that steers automatically in slow traffic following lane markers and avoiding other vehicles says jeremy salinger of gm who heads the team developing the technology</s>
<s>ford america’s secondlargest carmaker is developing something similar called traffic jam assist</s>
<s>bmw plans to launch a compact electric car the i3 that can do this trick next year</s>
<s>it will cost less than €40000 $50000 says ralph huber of bmw</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>autonomous driving in slow traffic is a logical combination of adaptive cruisecontrol and the lanekeeping systems already available in some vehicles which either warn the driver if the car starts to drift out of lane or apply corrective steering to keep it in lane</s>
<s>in addition a growing number of car models have the option of selfparking systems</s>
<s>the job of the driver is in short slowly being chipped away</s>
<s>the industry will build fully autonomous cars says mr salinger</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the addition of autonomous control need not add much to the cost</s>
<s>an extra $3000 or so should cover it mr coelingh believes</s>
<s>and there is evidence that drivers are prepared to pay for addons that improve safety as well as convenience</s>
<s>volvo already sells a popular driverassistance option called city safety for around $2000 for example</s>
<s>it slams on the brakes if a distancemeasuring laser or camera detects a vehicle or pedestrian in the car’s path</s>
<s>city safety can prevent collisions completely at speeds of up to 30kph 18mph and at higher speeds it softens the impact</s>
<s>a similar braking system on mercedesbenz vehicles has reduced insurance claims for bodily injury by roughly a sixth according to the highway loss data institute an american research group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as adaptive cruise controls selfparking options and automatedbraking systems gradually become more capable and widespread it is not a big leap to full autonomous control</s>
<s>prototypes are starting to move off test tracks and onto real roads</s>
<s>last year bmw sent a robotic car at motorway speeds from munich the german carmaker’s hometown to nuremberg about 170km to the north</s>
<s>a professional driver sat behind the wheel just in case</s>
<s> audi part of the volkswagen group caused a stir two years ago when it sent a selfdriving tts coupe through 156 tight curves along nearly 20km of paved and dirt road on colorado’s pikes peak with nobody behind the wheel</s>
<s>modified with help from roboticists at stanford university the car travelled about as fast as one driven by an average driver</s>
<s>peter oel head of volkswagen’s silicon valley electronics research lab says his team even programmed the car named shelley to skid its rear tyres on tight corners a trick known as “drifting”</s>
<s>the same car recently drove itself at 190kph on a racetrack</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>getting a car to drive along an open road without crashing into other vehicles is one thing</s>
<s>getting it to handle a complete journey on its own—including navigating junctions and roundabouts responding appropriately at pedestrian crossings and avoiding obstacles on the road—is rather more difficult</s>
<s>to build such a machine costs around $1m for the car kit software and brainpower says jonathan sprinkle coleader of an americanaustralian team that entered a driverless vehicle in the 2007 darpa urban challenge a roboticcar contest sponsored by the research arm of the american department of defence</s>
<s>because modern engines drivetrains and brakes already receive their instructions via electronic signals there is surprisingly little need for additional mechanical parts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what is needed however is an array of extra sensors to make cars more aware of their surroundings</s>
<s>mapping nearby features spotting road edges and lane markings reading signs and traffic lights and identifying pedestrians is done using a combination of cameras radar and lidar which works like radar but with pulses of light rather than radio waves</s>
<s>ultrasonic detectors provide more accurate mapping of the surroundings at short range for example when parking</s>
<s>gyroscopes accelerometers and altimeters provide more accurate positioning than is possible using globalpositioning system gps satellites alone</s>
<s>all this can cost $200000 for an experimental car says dr sprinkle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google spent roughly that much fitting out each of the dozen or so robotic vehicles it has built by modifying american german and japanese cars</s>
<s>eventually fewer and cheaper sensors should do the trick but google and other researchers are still working out how to combine readings from multiple sensors and determining which sensors work best in conditions such as night driving or heavy rain</s>
<s>so far the internet giant’s fleet has collectively clocked up nearly 500000km under autonomous control on both test tracks and public roads including san francisco’s lombard street one of america’s steepest and most twisty roadways</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>teaching computers to drive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once the sensors and activators are in place building a driverless car is essentially a software problem</s>
<s>google’s approach involves driving a route manually with all the sensors switched on to build a detailed 3d map of features such as signs guardrails and overpasses says anthony levandowski project leader for google’s selfdriving cars</s>
<s>then when the autonomousdriving mode is switched on accompanied by a spaceship soundeffect the software can predict hazards with reasonable accuracy</s>
<s>a shaded bridge in a damp valley for example may be icy until noon if the nighttime temperature drops below a certain point</s>
<s>each time a car follows a particular route it collects more data</s>
<s>google’s software also ingests data on speed limits and recorded accidents</s>
<s>because the car’s roofmounted sensors can see in all directions it arguably has greater situational awareness than a human driver</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one area where humans are still clearly superior however is in judging an object’s material or weight</s>
<s>unable to tell the difference between a chunk of mattress and a block of steel on the carriageway a selfdriving vehicle might brake harder than would be wise says sebastian thrun a stanford university roboticist who led the development of google’s driverless cars</s>
<s>similarly a carpet of leaves or snow might lead a robotic car to miscalculate the position of the road’s edge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but as driverless cars clock up more miles solutions are being worked out</s>
<s>to evaluate the danger posed by an object on the road google’s software takes into account the behaviour of other vehicles</s>
<s>if other cars do not swerve or brake to avoid it it is more likely to be a plastic bag than a rock</s>
<s>“fusing” data from various types of sensors can also remove uncertainty</s>
<s>to judge distances for example radar or lidar sensors in the front bumpers can be supplemented by video cameras</s>
<s>infrared sensors can pick up the heat signature of a human obscured by fog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is even possible to make judgments about the mental or physical state of other drivers</s>
<s>software developed by probayes a firm based near grenoble in france identifies and then steers clear of drivers who are angry drowsy tipsy or aggressive</s>
<s>upset drivers tend to speed up and brake quickly</s>
<s>sleepy drivers tend to drift off course gradually and veer back sharply</s>
<s>drunk drivers struggle to keep a straight line</s>
<s>the firm sells its software to toyota japan’s car giant</s>
<s>google’s cars have even been programmed to behave appropriately at junctions such as fourway stops edging forward cautiously to signal their intentions and stopping quickly if another driver moves out of turn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far google’s vehicles have not been involved in a single accident while under computer control although a google car crashed into the back of another car in 2011 it was being driven by a human at the time</s>
<s>the company says its cars have yet to master snowcovered roads or reading temporary signs and signals around roadworks</s>
<s>a telling sign of progress however is that google researchers have recently started using the cars solo rather than in pairs</s>
<s>this lets individual researchers commute to work in their autonomous cars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the road ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>autonomous vehicles for individuals may still be a few years away but they are already being used in industry</s>
<s>late last year rio tinto an angloaustralian mining giant decided to increase its fleet of selfdriving trucks which haul iron ore from ten to 150 vehicles within four years</s>
<s>manufactured by a subsidiary of komatsu a japanese firm each truck is the size of a threestorey house and uses satellite positioning to carry nearly 300 tonnes of ore along predefined routes</s>
<s>an accident then could be very nasty indeed</s>
<s>but james petty head of rio tinto’s robotictrucks programme says the trucks’ emergencybraking and evasiveaction systems have not been triggered once since the technology was introduced in 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason is that as well as using the usual plethora of sensors the trucks inform each other of their position and speed using “vehicle to vehicle” v2v wireless links so that they can for example coordinate their actions at junctions</s>
<s>human truckdrivers by contrast regularly have to take evasive action</s>
<s>they also demand salaries of around a$100000 $100000 to work in the remote pilbara region of western australia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>initially driverless vehicles will be in a minority but eventually it may make sense to redesign road networks around them</s>
<s>using v2v communication for example driverless cars approaching a junction could coordinate their movements to keep traffic flowing smoothly rather than having to stop and take turns</s>
<s>traffic lights and road signs would no longer be needed</s>
<s>v2v would also allow vehicles to travel together in platoons or “road trains” making more efficient use of road capacity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a consortium of european companies has tested fivevehicle platoons in which the lead vehicle is controlled by a human driver and the other four travel close behind it under autonomous control</s>
<s>trials including a 200km trip on a motorway near barcelona in may have found that platooning cuts fuel consumption by about 15 because each vehicle apart from the lead vehicle travels in the slipstream of the one in front</s>
<s>passengers find the proximity unnerving at first but they quickly get used to it says eric chan of ricardo the british technology firm leading the project</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>clearly a shift towards driverless cars would completely transform the experience of road travel</s>
<s>but there would be further knockon effects beyond the car itself</s>
<s>selfdriving vehicles would keep the growing numbers of elderly people in ageing societies mobile for longer for example</s>
<s>the design of cars would undoubtedly change if the controls are rarely needed steering wheels and pedals will vanish and cars will be built instead for comfort perhaps with a playstationlike controller that pops out on the rare occasions when manual control is needed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the nature of car ownership could be transformed</s>
<s>why own a car outright if you can rent or share more cheaply summoning a nearby vehicle with your smartphone</s>
<s>you could be picked up by a vehicle while its owner works or sleeps says sebastian ballweg cofounder of autonetzer a german “carsharing” broker of hourly or daily rentals between private individuals</s>
<s>some people regard their choice of car as an important means of social signalling but fractional or shared ownership might be cheaper and more convenient</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the rise of driverless cars would also affect the planning and layout of cities</s>
<s>assuming that autonomous vehicles make journeys quicker and use road space more efficiently how should planners exploit the benefits of automation</s>
<s>on the one hand it would allow cities to get bigger by reducing the time and stress associated with commuting</s>
<s>on the other it could allow cities to become denser by reducing the amount of space that needs to be dedicated to roads and parking</s>
<s>alternatively space allocated to roads in city centres could be used for bike lanes or parks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if driverless vehicles are to become commonplace several problems must be solved aside from working out how to build them in the first place</s>
<s>appropriate regulation will be needed to ensure safety and reassure other road users</s>
<s>in america nevada has taken the lead in this regard</s>
<s>in may the state’s department of motor vehicles dmv based in carson city issued its first three autonomousvehicle licences to google</s>
<s>applications from two other firms are expected soon</s>
<s>licences are issued on condition that applicants post a $1m bond</s>
<s>this is intended to prevent tinkerers from “building a little project in their garage and jumping on the road” and causing an accident says bruce breslow the head of nevada’s dmv</s>
<s>the state also requires that robotic vehicles have “black boxes” that store the previous 30 seconds of camera footage and sensor data to establish who or what is at fault in the event of an accident</s>
<s>other states are passing similar laws</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are additional worries</s>
<s>vehiclecontrol software remains “fairly hackable” says david zuby chief researcher at the insurance institute for highway safety an american industry body</s>
<s>unless protocols for vehicletovehicle communication are robust and secure attackers could cause chaos by making cars crash into each other</s>
<s>john simpson a privacy advocate at consumer watchdog a california lobby group is concerned that google is not so much teaching computers to drive as it is pioneering a nightmarish form of advertising</s>
<s>google might be tempted for a fee to favour routes that lead past its advertisers</s>
<s>he presented his case in june in testimony to the transportation committee of california’s state assembly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and although driverless cars can be expected to reduce the number of accidents and road deaths they will not eliminate them altogether</s>
<s>it is only a matter of time before the maker of an autonomous vehicle is sued for unleashing a killer robot says michael toscano head of the association for unmanned vehicle systems international an industry body in arlington virginia</s>
<s>but if selfdriving cars really are safer than cars driven by humans the law could work in their favour too</s>
<s>some cities might ban manual driving to save lives and ease congestion</s>
<s>there is no doubt that selfdriving cars are coming</s>
<s>it is less clear where they will take us</s>
