<s>a clash over india’s drug market was inevitable</s>
<s>foreign drugmakers facing paltry growth in the west are eyeing india hungrily</s>
<s>rising incomes and rates of chronic disease may push sales from $12 billion in 2010 to $74 billion in 2020 according to pwc a consultancy</s>
<s>but tapping this growth means having patents that protect intellectual property</s>
<s>india is home to a thriving generics industry whose copycat drugs make up about 90 of the market</s>
<s>india’s drugpatent laws are just seven years old</s>
<s>its government is keen to encourage generics and keep prices down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now india’s patent rules are being put to the test</s>
<s>novartis a swiss giant is challenging india for denying a patent for glivec its blockbuster cancer drug</s>
<s>the fight is due to reach india’s supreme court on september 11th</s>
<s>bayer a german drugmaker has a different problem in march india’s patent controller ordered it to license a drug to a local manufacturer</s>
<s>its appeal had its first hearing on september 3rd</s>
<s>the cases will help decide how quickly india’s 12 billion people get new drugs and at what price</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>india’s drug industry has a unique history</s>
<s>for more than 30 years the country did not recognise pharmaceutical patents</s>
<s>domestic firms became masters at copying medicine and making it cheaply</s>
<s>after joining the world trade organisation wto in 1995 india had to change its patent policy</s>
<s>but its new system in place since 2005 includes special protections for both patients and generic manufacturers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for example the law bars patents of minor changes to existing drugs a practice known as “evergreening”</s>
<s>drug reformulations are often used to extend patents elsewhere they get no protection in india</s>
<s>the country also has broad criteria for “compulsory licensing”</s>
<s>a wto agreement allows countries in some instances to force a firm to license a patented drug to a generic company</s>
<s>india’s rules give officials broad powers to do this</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now both provisions are under attack</s>
<s>in 2006 india denied novartis a patent for glivec calling it an unpatentable modification of an existing substance imatinib</s>
<s>novartis insists this is nonsense</s>
<s>only by making it in salt form imatinib mesylate did novartis have a proper drug the body absorbed the medicine 30 more easily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paul herrling the chair of novartis’s institute for tropical diseases says the case is a test of what is patentable in india</s>
<s>“we are being accused of evergreening” he says</s>
<s>“having that concept applied to glivec which was one of the major breakthroughs in cancer therapies is completely ridiculous” michelle childs of médecins sans frontières a nonprofit retorts that drug firms such as novartis should not win patents for minor improvements</s>
<s>this would keep generics off the market driving up prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bayer’s case is equally heated</s>
<s>in 2008 it won an indian patent for nexavar a kidneycancer drug</s>
<s>but in march india’s patent controller issued the country’s first compulsory licence</s>
<s>he wrote that bayer had not made nexavar “reasonably affordable” bayer offered it for a whopping $5000 a month that the company failed to provide enough of the drug and in a protectionist nod reckoned that importing nexavar further hurt bayer’s case</s>
<s>the controller ordered an indian company natco to sell nexavar for onethirtieth of bayer’s price</s>
<s>bayer will receive a 6 royalty</s>
<s>meanwhile bayer is fending off another competitor cipla which has sold generic nexavar in india for years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as these cases drag on india’s government is considering other ways to get cheaper medicine</s>
<s>it plans to offer free generics in public hospitals which would drive up sales of very cheap copies</s>
<s>it may also set price controls for patented drugs</s>
<s>however generic companies are not immune to regulatory pressure</s>
<s>ministers plan to expand price controls for a broader swathe of generics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cost versus innovation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“we realise the industry will take a hit” explains dg</s>
<s>shah of the indian pharmaceutical alliance which represents big generic companies</s>
<s>“we’re trying to find a solution so that the government’s concerns on access and affordability are addressed without threatening the longterm growth of the pharmaceutical industry” nice work if they can get it</s>
