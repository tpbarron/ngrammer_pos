<s>according to his friends the man in charge of the fukushima daiichi nuclearpower plant during the 2011 disaster masao yoshida says it felt like being on iwo jima</s>
<s>that is the north pacific island heroically defended by the japanese in 1945 but doomed to fall to the americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his two underlings atsufumi yoshizawa and masatoshi fukura do not portray the struggle quite so graphically</s>
<s>in their first interviews with foreign media since the disaster they spoke of the sense of responsibility of the socalled fukushima 50 those who risked their lives to fight the soaring levels of radiation coming out of the plant in the hours and days after the earthquake and tsunami on march 11th last year</s>
<s>they were driven especially by a desire to protect the local communities in which many of their families lived</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the fukushima 50 despite heroic efforts still suffer from the complex of emotions that soldiers might experience when returning from a losing battle</s>
<s>a sense of shame and stigmatisation lingers</s>
<s>that much was evident earlier in october when yoshihiko noda japan’s prime minister called them in to thank them</s>
<s>it was fully 18 months after the disaster a long time to wait to honour those who as mr noda put it saved japan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the men gave him snapshots of what it was like during the frantic days after march 11th explosions that threatened to kill them the risk of electrocution as they sought to restore power in the cold and dark radioactive debris nothing to eat and drink but biscuits and water</s>
<s>yet what was striking was that six of the eight men present hid their faces from the cameras</s>
<s>far from feeling like heroes they took pains to conceal their identities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tokyo electric tepco which owns the plant long resisted all requests to interview these men</s>
<s>but the crippled utility has now been taken over by the government which told it to allow two of them to talk to the economist a first</s>
<s>heroism is a tricky subject in a grouporiented culture like japan’s—all the more so when it comes to talking to employees of tepco which is deeply reviled</s>
<s>more than 100000 people have been evacuated from towns and villages around perhaps permanently</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr yoshizawa was one of the top tepco officials on site handling the emergency</s>
<s>he says so much was going on—earthquake aftershocks tsunami three explosions rising radiation readings—that there was scarcely time to reflect on the dangers</s>
<s>mr fukura concurs</s>
<s>“the circumstances were bad” he says</s>
<s>“but i had no intention of dying</s>
<s>everyone did their best</s>
<s>dying would have meant giving up”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet this sense of duty masks some very human aspects to the drama</s>
<s>four out of five people at the site were locals</s>
<s>they laboured under fears that their families may have been washed away by the tsunami</s>
<s>they also knew that the rising radiation endangered their own villages which they were desperate to prevent</s>
<s>they knew each other intimately from years of working together</s>
<s>that kept them going</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr yoshizawa says that at first the main concern was the safety of 6000 workers including 2000 near the reactors soon after the earthquake and tsunami</s>
<s>for part of the first night it was felt wrongly as it turned out that all the reactors were cooling down</s>
<s>that appeared to buy some time</s>
<s>but after a hydrogen explosion in the first reactor building a horrific chain of events ensued frustrating at every turn the men’s ability to inject water to cool the reactors</s>
<s>as two other explosions occurred on monday and tuesday march 14th and 15th the pressure to evacuate most of the staff became intense</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that says mr yoshizawa was when mr yoshida the man in charge he has since been in hospital with what is said to be an unrelated form of cancer faced his hardest decision saving as many people as possible from danger while keeping enough people on site to do what was needed</s>
<s>both men interviewed insist there was never any thought by onsite bosses of abandoning the plant</s>
<s>mr yoshizawa who had temporarily relocated to an office a short distance from fukushima daiichi returned to the plant at the height of the crisis</s>
<s>“i thought that maybe i would end up not leaving that as we japanese say we would ‘bury our bones’ in that place”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the men express in different ways the conflicted feelings that linger on</s>
<s>mr yoshizawa choked with emotion when he explained how the men fought a losing battle to save their local towns and villages</s>
<s>then he added “but in japanese society many view us as the perpetrators”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that view is particularly strong among the evacuees from fukushima but it is also true of the country at large</s>
<s>japanese soldiers felt a similar sense of stigmatisation after returning from defeat in 1945</s>
<s>mr fukura has no time for talk of heroism—or stigmatisation for that matter</s>
<s>he says that because most of the men work for tepco they cannot separate their sense of responsibility from that of the company</s>
<s>that sounds like an admirable japanese trait but it was not shared by all of tepco’s bosses</s>
<s>only in october after armtwisting by the government did the company admit it had underplayed the risks it faced at fukushima daiichi</s>
