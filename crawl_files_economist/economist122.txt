<s>were sicily an independent state its 5m people would give it a bigger population than eight countries in the eu</s>
<s>the island has always mattered seldom more than now</s>
<s>on october 28th its voters will choose a new regional governor and parliament in the first big test of public opinion in the runup to italy’s next general election probably in april</s>
<s>how sicilians vote may answer some of the many questions that hang over the national vote</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it could make or break the chances of angelino alfano the secretary of silvio berlusconi’s conservative people of freedom movement pdl</s>
<s>on october 24th mr berlusconi confirmed he would not run again for prime minister and announced a primary election to choose the pdl’s candidate on december 16th</s>
<s>mr alfano a sicilian whom the media tycoon had named as his successor is a frontrunner</s>
<s>but if his native island where mr berlusconi won all 61 seats in italy’s 2001 general election veers left it will blight his chances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plagued by splits and regional graft scandals the pdl is bleeding support</s>
<s>the last opinion poll gave its candidate for governor sebastiano “nello” musumeci only a slim lead over rosario crocetta of the democratic party pd italy’s biggest leftwing group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr crocetta is yoked to the conservative christian democrat union of the centre udc</s>
<s>but the pd plans to fight the general election alongside the more radical left ecology and freedom sel movement</s>
<s>victory for the pdudc ticket in sicily could prompt a rethink especially if the pd’s leader pier luigi bersani loses his job to a more centrist rival matteo renzi in a primary election in november</s>
<s>this choice of partners could affect the fate of mario monti the nonparty technocrat who has been italy’s prime minister since last november</s>
<s>he would find it a lot more comfortable to belong to a pdudc coalition than to a pdsel one</s>

<p>
<s>the joker—literally as well as politically—is beppe grillo the comedian whose vitriolically antiestablishment five star movement is again surging on a wave of indignation at the recent corruption scandals</s>
<s>after swimming to sicily from the mainland he has conducted a vigorous campaign for his party’s candidate filling town squares and rattling mainstream commentators and politicians with his raucous populism</s>
