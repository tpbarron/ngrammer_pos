<s>california’s public universities were once the envy of the world</s>
<s>under the state’s pioneering “master plan” for higher education signed into law in 1960 the top 125 of graduating highschool students in the state are guaranteed entry to the wellrespected university of california uc system the california state university csu system is open to the top third</s>
<s>community colleges accept allcomers including adults</s>
<s>the plan hugely expanded higher education in california and led also to the emergence of worldclass establishments like berkeley and ucla</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet it tied the universities’ fortunes to those of the state</s>
<s>in good times that was fine</s>
<s>but more recently public universities in california have been hit hard by the state’s fiscal woes</s>
<s>declining state support has forced the uc system to slash costs and to raise average tuition fees by 50 in just three years</s>
<s>csu fees have risen by 47 in the same period</s>
<s>“the historical model has broken down” says mark yudof the uc president</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the proportion of highschool graduates progressing to uc or csu has fallen from 22 to 18 in the past five years according to hans johnson at the public policy institute of california</s>
<s>the extra fee revenue is not enough to compensate for the decline in state funding and so both uc and csu have aimed to reduce enrolment numbers</s>
<s>uc must still offer places to all eligible students but uses ruses such as restricting access to popular campuses such as ucla or berkeley in favour of outoftheway campuses in places like merced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is an altogether different story for some of california’s private institutions which tend to charge far higher tuition fees</s>
<s>stanford university under its president john hennessy who sits on the boards of google and cisco has strengthened links with the gogetters of silicon valley and raised a recordbreaking $62 billion in five years</s>
<s>the los angelesbased university of southern california usc once mocked by detractors as the university of spoiled children is also thriving</s>
<s>it is aiming to raise $6 billion by 2018 and already has some chunky gifts in the bag</s>
<s>it has more international students on its books than any other american university and after the recent launch of the usc schwarzenegger institute for state and global policy one particularly notable foreignborn professor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with 22000 people on its payroll usc is the biggest privatesector employer in los angeles</s>
<s>a proposal to redevelop the village a shabby retail area next to the main campus into a shiny complex with student housing and new shops should create 12000 more jobs in usc’s poorish district in south los angeles if the university gets its way the city council is due to issue a planning verdict soon</s>
<s>“we have taken on a broader role” says thomas sayles senior vicepresident for university relations</s>
<s>“we want to be a civic leader”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet private institutions like usc cannot simply pick up the slack left by the public ones</s>
<s>first even with generous aid packages they cannot hope to match the public universities on access for students from poor or what are sometimes called “nontraditional” backgrounds</s>
<s>second even taken collectively private universities do not operate on the same scale</s>
<s>a big majority of enrolled students attend public institutions</s>
<s>“there is no private solution to this issue” says patrick callan president of the higher education policy institute</s>
<s>“there must be a public solution”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem though is growing mr johnson points out that for the first time in the history of modern california the state’s besteducated citizens are the 50somethings rather than the 20 or 30somethings</s>
<s>and previous waves of immigration raise demographic challenges as a bulge of latinos reaches college age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>uc’s decline can be exaggerated</s>
<s>some of its campuses continue to perform well in national rankings it has significant nonstate revenue sources and it has a strong research record</s>
<s>“we’re hardly at death’s door” says mr yudof</s>
<s>a big moment will come in november when californians vote on a tax measure</s>
<s>if it is approved the polls are tight uc and csu will freeze tuition fees for the first time in years</s>
<s>if it fails they will have to cope with a sudden drop of $250m in state support</s>
<s>mr yudof calls it a “defining moment” for california</s>
