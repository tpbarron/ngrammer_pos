<s>when it comes to repelling gunk car wax and teflon are among the best materials available</s>
<s>but they could be better</s>
<s>a good measure of their lack of stickiness is their “water contact angle”—a way of measuring how effectively the material repels water</s>
<s>for car wax it is 90° and for teflon 95°</s>
<s>the higher the angle the more repellent the surface is—and the cleaner it stays</s>
<s>as anyone with a car or a nonstick frying pan knows however the microscopic wax or teflon layers gradually wear away and their protective ability is lost</s>
<s>so finding a way to make the layers bond together more strongly would also keep surfaces cleaner</s>
<s>tong lin a chemist at deakin university in australia thinks he has found a trick that can both increase the contact angle and improve resilience using an idea familiar from basic chemistry the covalent bond</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>normally the layers of teflon car wax and substances like them are held together by ionic bonds</s>
<s>these form when one or more electrons leap from one atom to another in order to fulfil a requirement deep in the heart of quantum theory that such particles pair up if they can so that their spins cancel out</s>
<s>the atom that gains an electron thus acquires a negative charge and the atom that loses an electron a positive charge</s>
<s>because unlike charges attract the charged atoms stick together</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem with ionic bonds is that they are easily disrupted by acids and bases—chemicals which respectively add electrons to and take them from other molecules</s>
<s>in a covalent bond by contrast electron pairs are formed when atoms share electrons rather than transferring them</s>
<s>this makes covalent bonds less susceptible to disruption</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>accordingly dr lin and his colleagues tried to build up covalent bonds between the layers of a waterrepellent or hydrophobic material called cellulose acetate butyrate which is used to make waterresistant fabrics</s>
<s>in doing so they not only made it acid and baseproof they also improved its gunkresistance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they performed this trick as they explain in the journal langmuir using a substance called phenyl azido which readily forms covalent bonds with its neighbours when exposed to ultraviolet light</s>
<s>they immersed films made of cellulose acetate butyrate in solutions of phenyl azido and silica which is positively charged and phenyl azido and polyallylamine hydrochloride which is negatively charged</s>
<s>they spread these films in alternate layers on top of sheets of cotton fabric and exposed the sandwich to ultraviolet light for 30 minutes to bond the layers covalently</s>
<s>then they tested its ability to repel water acids and bases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new material was amazingly hydrophobic</s>
<s>its contact angle was 154° out of a possible maximum of 180°</s>
<s>standard cellulose acetate butyrate has a contact angle of 76°</s>
<s> the material was also impressively robust</s>
<s>even after being dunked for 95 hours in hydrochloric acid or 44 hours in sodium hydroxide it maintained a contact angle of greater than 150°</s>
<s>it also did so after enduring 50 cycles in one of the most hostile environments known on the planet a domestic washing machine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you would not it is true want cellulose acetate butyrate on either your car or your frying pan</s>
<s>but it would offer a way to make better raincoats and is also a proof of principle</s>
<s>if fabrics can be made more waterrepellent in this way then perhaps other materials can be too</s>
