<s>on march 31st 2009 bernardo de bernardinis then deputy chief of italys civil protection department told people in and around the medieval italian city of laquila that a series of tremors which had been felt in the area over the past four months posed “no danger”</s>
<s>speaking to a journalist from a local television station he said that “the scientific community continues to confirm to me that in fact it is a favourable situation that is to say a continuous discharge of energy” six days later laquila and several surrounding villages lay in ruins</s>
<s>an earthquake of magnitude 63 had destroyed thousands of buildings and killed 308 people</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr de bernardinis an expert on floods made his comments just before a meeting held in laquila in which he and six other scientists and engineers were called upon to analyse the risk posed by the ongoing swarm of tremors</s>
<s>the seven a mixture of full and acting members of the civil protection departments national commission for the forecast and prevention of major risks have since been indicted for manslaughter and their trial starts on september 20th</s>
<s>the prosecution contends that dr de bernardiniss comments and others made by franco barberi a volcanologist who is the commissions vicepresident at a press conference immediately following the meeting gave undue reassurance to the public that a major quake was not on its way and that as a result some people who would otherwise have left their homes following two tremors on the night between april 5th and 6th remained indoors and perished</s>

<p>
<s>fabio picuti the public prosecutor stresses that the charge is not about whether the experts who included enzo boschi then president of the national institute of geophysics and vulcanology ingv should have predicted exactly when where and with what force the earthquake would have struck</s>
<s>he recognises that is something which remains beyond the bounds of science</s>
<s>instead he says the seven are guilty of negligence because they did not take the risk of a big quake seriously enough</s>
<s>he argues that their discussions as recorded in the official minutes of the meeting of march 31st were too generic and completely failed to address the risk at hand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gian michele calvi an expert in earthquake engineering who is one of the indicted seven says the commission recognised that laquila is in a highly seismic zone and that a powerful earthquake could therefore happen at any time</s>
<s>but he says that based on the evaluations of the committees seismologists they considered the probability of a major quake to be “essentially the same with or without the seismic sequence” and that as a result they did not discuss the possibility of emergency action</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however this assessment appears at odds with what seismologists have known for at least 20 years—that small earthquakes increase the likelihood that a powerful event will happen in the near future even if the absolute probability of such an event remains low</s>
<s>indeed warner marzocchi and anna maria lombardi of the ingv showed that a few hours before the earthquake actually struck modelling would have suggested the chance that a powerful quake would occur within 10 kilometres of laquila within three days rose from one in 200000 the background level to about one in 1000</s>

<p>
<s>thomas jordan an earth scientist at the university of southern california in los angeles who chaired an international review of earthquake forecasting in italy in the wake of laquilas quake says that these calculations must be put into context</s>
<s>he points out that with the exception of an informal system in california no country in the world has yet set up regular probabilistic earthquake forecasting that can be used to guide emergency actions</s>
<s>the hope of policymakers until recently was that research would identify precursor signals that could predict earthquakes with near certainty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>damned if you do damned if you dont</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr jordan argues that a focus on prediction rather than forecasting held sway in italy in the days before the quake at laquila</s>
<s>he says that the seven members of the commission concentrated on refuting the predictions made by gioacchino giuliani a laboratory technician at the nearby national institute of nuclear physics who claims to have developed a method for predicting earthquakes that involves measuring emissions of radon</s>
<s>his public pronouncements reportedly caused panic in the nearby city of sulmona two days before the meeting of the commission no big earthquake followed on that occasion</s>
<s>the members of the commission therefore according to dr jordan “got trapped into a conversation with a yesno answer”</s>
<s>the result he says was that the commission gave the impression that there would be no quake</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gaetano de luca who is in charge of looking after the ingvs seismographs in the abruzzo region of which laquila is the capital agrees that the commission got sidetracked by mr giuliani</s>
<s>but he says this cannot be used as an excuse</s>
<s>he claims that the increased danger in the runup to the quake was clear maintaining that a swarm of comparable duration intensity and geographical concentration had not been witnessed in the area for at least 50 years</s>
<s>as a result he argues simple precautions such as checking the buildings most at risk should have been taken</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however dr de luca reckons it is not only the experts who should be on trial</s>
<s>he says that local politicians and administrators should also be held to account</s>
<s>“it is right that you look for those responsible” he adds “but the search should be cast more widely”</s>
