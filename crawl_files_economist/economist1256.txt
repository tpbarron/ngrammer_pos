<s>pakistan and the united states are meant to be allies but their differences are starkly drawn in the case of shakil afridi</s>
<s>he is regarded as a hero by american officials and a traitor by pakistan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cia secretly recruited the pakistani doctor during the hunt for osama bin laden</s>
<s>he set up a fake vaccination programme going from door to door in the northern town of abbottabad seeking a dna sample from the house in which americans suspected the alqaeda leader was living</s>
<s>on may 23rd dr afridi was sentenced in pakistan without a lawyer and under a hasty system of tribal justice to 33 years in jail for treason</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>behind the scenes americans scrabbled but failed to reach a deal to free dr afridi from pakistani custody</s>
<s>his activities were discovered by pakistans spies after the american specialforces operation a year ago that killed bin laden</s>
<s>leon panetta americas defence secretary insisted dr afridi “was not in any way treasonous towards pakistan”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>working for a foreign intelligence agency is a crime in many places including america</s>
<s>pakistanis feel justified in punishing dr afridi</s>
<s>although bin laden was clearly an enemy of pakistan too the american operation that killed him is seen as a national humiliation</s>
<s>the collapse in relations it sparked endures today see article </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not only pakistani nationalists are angry at the cia for using dr afridi</s>
<s>it has also damaged the credibility of vaccination programmes in pakistan including the one against polio</s>
<s>ngos condemn the ploy</s>
<s>the cia is unrepentant</s>
