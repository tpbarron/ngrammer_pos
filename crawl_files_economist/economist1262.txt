<s>the poems were under his shirt 400 of them</s>
<s>the date was july 16th 1979 just two days—he noted it—after the anniversary of the fall of the bastille</s>
<s>freedom day</s>
<s>he ran through the gate of the british embassy in hanoi past the guard demanding to see the ambassador</s>
<s>the guard couldn’t stop him</s>
<s>in the reception area a few vietnamese were sitting at a table</s>
<s>he fought them off and crashed the table over</s>
<s>in a cloakroom nearby an english girl was doing her hair she dropped her comb in terror</s>
<s>the noise brought three englishmen out and he thrust his sheaf of poems at one of them</s>
<s>then calm again he let himself be arrested</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thus nguyen chi thien sent his poems out of communist vietnam</s>
<s>they were published as “flowers of hell” translated into half a dozen languages and won the international poetry award in 1985</s>
<s>he heard of this vaguely in his various jails</s>
<s>in hoa lo the “hanoi hilton” one of his captors furiously waved a book in his face</s>
<s>to his delight he saw it was his own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he was not strong physically</s>
<s>he contracted tb as a boy his parents had to sell their house to pay for his antibiotics</s>
<s>then since 1960 on various pretexts—contesting the regime’s view of history writing “irreverent” poetry—he had done several long spells in prison and labour camp</s>
<s>hard rice and salt water had made him scrawny and thinhaired by his 40s</s>
<s>internally though he was like steel mind heart soul</s>
<s>sheer determination had forced him through the british embassy that day</s>
<s>in fact the more the regime hurt him the more he thrived</s>

<p>
<s>they exiled me to the heart of the jungle wishing to fertilise the manioc with my remains</s>
<s>i turned into an expert hunter and came out full of snake wisdom and rhino fierceness</s>
<s>they sank me into the ocean wishing me to remain in the depths</s>
<s>i became a deep sea diver and came up covered with scintillating pearls</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pearls were his poems</s>
<s>he kept his early efforts in a tabledrawer where he found them later the paper gnawed by cockroaches</s>
<s>the mind’s treasury was a safer place for them</s>
<s>it was also for almost half his life the only place he had</s>
<s>in prison he was allowed no pen paper or books</s>
<s>he therefore memorised in the night quiet each one of his hundreds of poems carefully revised it for several days and mentally filed it away</s>
<s>if it didn’t work he mentally deleted it</s>
<s>if it started to smell bad—like the one about ho chi minh vietnam’s first communist leader—he turned it into a stinging dart instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>let the hacks with their prostituted pens comb his beard pat his head caress his arse</s>
<s>to hell with him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>walking out to till the fields with his fellow prisoners many of them poets too he would recite his poems to them and they would respond with theirs</s>
<s>some of them counted the beats on their fingers to remember</s>
<s>he never did memory alone served him</s>
<s>it saved him too</s>
<s>after 1979 he spent the best part of eight years in solitary in stocks or shackles in the dark</s>
<s>his poems became sobs wheezes bloody tubercular coughs</s>
<s>but in his mind he still set out fishing and watched dawn overtake the stars</s>
<s>he sniffed the jasmine and hot noodle soup on a night street in hanoi</s>
<s>he remembered his sister hao teaching him french at six—what a paradise the french occupation seemed in retrospect—and went swashbuckling again with d’artagnan and his crew</s>
<s>that way he kept alive</s>

<p>
<s>drinking with li bai</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a favourite prison companion was li bai the great poet of eighthcentury china</s>
<s>he would sup wine with him from amber cups loll on chaises longues watch pretty maidens weaving silk under the willow trees and the peach blossoms falling</s>
<s>he would talk to the moon with him and get wildly romantically drunk</s>
<s>there was a flavour here of his own careless youth his teahouse years of girls and smoking</s>
<s>both he and li bai had offended the emperor mocked the education system and been punished</s>
<s>but somehow the oppressions of the distant past seemed bearable</s>
<s>not so the acts of vietnam’s red demons with their nauseating loudspeaker jingles about happiness and light</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>out of prison li bailike he dealt in rice brandy for a while and tried to sell bicycle spokes</s>
<s>he could not make a go of it</s>
<s>from 1995 he managed to get shelter in america</s>
<s>he lived humbly in little saigon in orange county california lodging with fellow countrymen</s>
<s>green tea and smoking remained his chief comforts</s>
<s>a flat cap or a fedora were his trademarks</s>
<s>he had nothing to share but his poems and his memories of fellow poets whose cattletrodden graves now dotted the hills around the labour camps</s>
<s>that and his roaring hatred of the regime in his country where his writings remained banned</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if people could see his heart he had written back in 1964 during his first spell in prison they would see it was an ancient pen and inkstand gathering dust or a poor roadside inn offering only the comfort of an oil lamp</s>
<s>but it was also a paddy field waiting for the floodrains of august</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so that it can overflow into a thousand waves whitecrested ones that will sweep everything away</s>
