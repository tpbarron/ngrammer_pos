<s>once upon a time the overstressed executive bellowing orders into a telephone cancelling meetings staying late at the office and dying of a heart attack was a stereotype of modernity</s>
<s>that was before the whitehall studies a series of investigations of british civil servants begun in the 1960s</s>
<s>these studies found that the truth is precisely the opposite</s>
<s>those at the top of the pecking order actually have the least stressful and most healthy lives</s>
<s>cardiac arrest—and indeed early death from any cause—is the prerogative of underlings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such results have since been confirmed many times both in human societies and in other primate species with strong social hierarchies</s>
<s>but whereas the pattern is wellunderstood the biological mechanisms underlying it are not</s>
<s>a study just published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences however sheds some light on the matter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in it a group of researchers led by jenny tung and yoav gilad at the university of chicago looked at the effects of status on rhesus macaques</s>
<s>experience has shown that these monkeys display the simian equivalent of the whitehall studies findings</s>
<s>the high risk of disease among those at the bottom of the heap in both cases suggests that biochemical responses to low status affect a creatures immune system</s>
<s>those responses must in turn depend on changes in the way the creatures genes are expressed</s>
<s>to investigate this phenomenon means manipulating social hierarchies but that would be hard and probably unethical if it were done to human beings</s>
<s>you can however do it to monkeys and the researchers did</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unhappy minds in unhealthy bodies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr tung and dr gilad took 49 middleranking female macaques females were chosen because a lot of previous work on animal hierarchies has been done on female macaques and split them into groups of four or five</s>
<s>the researchers were able to control where in a group an individual ranked by the order in which it was introduced into its group newly introduced monkeys almost always adopt a role subordinate to existing group members</s>
<s>the hierarchies thus established the team conducted tests on cells in the monkeys blood in an attempt to determine the effect of a macaques rank on her biochemistry and in particular on how rank influences the activity of various genes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the answer is a lot</s>
<s>dr tung and dr gilad looked at the expression in each animal of 6097 genes 30 of the total number in a monkey genome—or for that matter in a human one</s>
<s>they were searching for correlations between social rank and gene activity and in 987 genes they found one</s>
<s>some genes were more active in highranking individuals others were more active in lowranking ones</s>
<s>the relationship was robust enough to work the other way round too</s>
<s>given a blood sample and no other information it was possible to predict an individuals status within her group with an accuracy of 80</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the next question was what all these genes actually do</s>
<s>sure enough the answer for a substantial fraction of them was that they regulate aspects of the immune system</s>
<s>in particular lowstatus individuals showed high levels of activity in genes associated with the production of various immunerelated cells and chemical signalling factors as well as those to do with inflammation a general immune response that involves tissue swelling and increased immunecell activity in the affected area</s>
<s>although the researchers did not explicitly examine the health of their simian charges chronic generalised inflammation is a risk factor in people for a long list of ailments ranging from heart trouble to alzheimers disease</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally the team investigated the mechanisms behind these differences in gene expression</s>
<s>in keeping with previous work they found that high and lowrank individuals showed different levels of responsiveness to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids which regulate immunesystem activity and response to stress</s>
<s>they also found changes in the mix of cells within the animals immune system itself</s>
<s>but what is new and intriguing is that they discovered for the first time evidence that a phenomenon called epigenetic change is at work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>epigenetics—currently one of molecular biologys hottest topics—is a process by which genes are activated or deactivated by the presence or absence of chemical structures called methyl and acetyl groups</s>
<s>dr tung and dr gilad found that methylation patterns were systematically different in high and lowranking animals</s>
<s>crucially these changes are generally passed on to the daughter cells produced when a cell divides and are thus perpetuated throughout an animals life</s>
<s>to the extent that epigenetic marking is involved in creating social status then status may be being maintained by the animals cells as they replicate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>destinys child</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those who believe in progress will however be pleased to know that epigenetics is not necessarily destiny</s>
<s>methyl groups may help maintain the status quo but if that status quo is interrupted by outside events they can be wiped away and a new lot put in place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr tung and dr gilad discovered this because a few of their monkeys did change status within their groups</s>
<s>when that happened changes in gene expression appropriate to the new status quickly followed</s>
<s>those who do break free from their lowly station then may begin to reap the health benefits almost immediately</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as with any animal study this one cannot simply be mapped straight onto humans</s>
<s>but it does provide pointers that researchers who work on people can use</s>
<s>in particular the experiment ensured that social rank was the only factor being changed providing strong evidence that the chain of causality runs from low social status through a disrupted immune system to worse health and not the other way around</s>
<s>the best medicine then is promotion</s>
<s>prosper and live long</s>
