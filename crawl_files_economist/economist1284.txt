<s>bankers are not quite expecting a wave of copycat mergers across europe</s>
<s>but the takeover announced on june 12th by unicredit italys largest bank of hvb group germanys secondbiggest has set the rumour mills turning</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>until this daring marriage which will create continental europes fourthbiggest bank the accepted wisdom had been that the mere sniff of a crossborder deal was enough to punish the share prices of both parties</s>
<s>yet by the time alessandro profumo unicredits chief executive and dieter rampl his counterpart at hvb hugged each other in front of cameras in munich the german banks share price had soared while the italian ones had at least held steady</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>four years ago when mr profumo was contemplating a similar deal with commerzbank another german bank the share prices of both plummeted</s>
<s>last year dexia a francobelgian bank group and sanpaolo imi its putative italian partner saw their shares suffer as investors turned up their noses at their merger proposal</s>
<s>mr profumo sensed that the mood started to change with last years purchase of abbey britains sixthbiggest bank by spains santander central hispano</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unicredit will pay around €19 billion $23 billion for a full takeover of hvb and its listed affiliates bank austria and bph a polish bank</s>
<s>the group will be a strong force in northern italy bavaria germanys southernmost state the northern german city of hamburg austria and four countries in central and eastern europe</s>
<s>about 9000 jobs are expected to go because of overlaps especially in poland</s>
<s>in germany 2000 jobs will be lost but through natural attrition in addition to 2200 already planned</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr profumo who is set to be the new banks chief executive and mr rampl the prospective chairman argue that the combination of stable business in western europe and high growth farther east is a good business mix</s>
<s>the new groups biggest challenge will be in germany where hvb has struggled with a fragmented retail market and a legacy of bad corporate and property loans</s>
<s>perhaps its biggest weakness is its thin capitalisation a tierone capital ratio of just over 5</s>
<s>that puts it at the bottom end of the range for banks with a market value of €40 billion or more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>peter wuffli chief executive of ubs a big swiss bank with a market value of sfr110 billion $86 billion and a tierone ratio of 115 has doubts about the economics of the unicredithvb merger and the challenge of dealing with two different languages and cultures</s>
<s>but he acknowledges two factors that may help it work hvbs urgent need to merge it was seen by the market as “on the ropes” and mr profumos track record in forging unicredit out of several smaller italian banks</s>
<s>mr profumo also believes he enjoys firstmover advantage no other merger spanning western and eastern europe could expect such a good fit he says</s>
<s>mr rampl believes that the success of bank austria which hvb bought in 2000 shows that crossborder mergers can indeed work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what might the next such move be</s>
<s>in the past italys central bank has frowned on foreign banks wanting to buy in italy</s>
<s>now that unicredit has forayed abroad the central bank might look more benignly on one of two current bids by the netherlands abn amro and spains banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria</s>
<s>the most pressure though may be felt by germanys two remaining big independent privatesector banks deutsche bank and commerzbank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>commerzbank has spent the past year cutting its costs in investment banking and trying to go it alone as a middletier corporate and retail bank</s>
<s>but it will surely merge or be taken over soon</s>
<s>rumours have linked it with deutsche and even with westlb a publicsector bank</s>
<s>a newly elected centreright government in north rhinewestphalia westlbs home state says it would like to sell its 25 stake</s>
<s>however the most likely buyer would be foreign—perhaps one of the big french banks or royal bank of scotland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>deutsches future is less easy to predict</s>
<s>one senior banker says that unicredits purchase of hvb “will force deutsche bank to decide what it wants to be” deutsche demurred last year when offered the chance to take over postbank a retail bank owned by deutsche post</s>
<s>now josef ackermann deutsches chief executive has told handelsblatt a german business newspaper that postbank would have been a good fit strategically</s>
<s>there are signs that deutsche is changing tack and aiming to expand at home and abroad though still straining to keep its return on equity at around 25 close to that of its chosen peer group of global banks</s>
<s>deutsche is among those interested in banca comerciala romana romanias biggest bank the last big bank privatisation in central europe</s>
<s>although deutsche has operations in several central european countries this would be its first big acquisition in the region</s>
<s>it is “lobbying hard in bucharest” according to a competitor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but for mr ackermann a big crossborder merger in western europe would be another matter</s>
<s>a prerequisite would be a more integrated european financial market</s>
<s>and then he would prefer a merger of equals in which two leading banks combine to make a bigger platform</s>
<s>however he notes that because such mergers bring no immediate cost savings analysts and investors tend to be sceptical about them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr profumo may have caught a change of mood in europe among investors national regulators and the public</s>
<s>he has managed to buy hvb without provoking howls of german protest mr ackermann was vilified in 2003 when it was rumoured that he might sell deutsche to americas citigroup</s>
<s>brussels bureaucrats have long urged greater integration of european financial markets while home regulators and the banks themselves have found many ways to protect their home turf</s>
<s>now santanders purchase of abbey which seemed a flash in the pan looks more likely to become a trend</s>
