<s>google employees “make crosses and spirals and galaxies of colour dance across the screens”</s>
<s>mr sloan combines timeseries visualisation and venetian typography with ease</s>
<s>there is a healthy dose of adventure too</s>
<s>every quest needs a warrior a wizard and a rogue the reader is told</s>
<s>the rebels’ journey to crack the code—grappling with an ancient cult using secret passwords and hidden doorways—will excite anyone’s inner child</s>

<p>
<s>but this is no fantasy yarn</s>
<s>mr sloan tethers his story to a weird reality striking a comical balance between eccentric and normal</s>
<s>the googlers live on the new frontier manipulating data in seconds and the unbroken spine exists in tradition and ritual</s>
<s>clay is somewhere in between</s>
<s>mr sloan has created some memorable characters—grumble the faceless hacker who releases free harry potter books including a new wizard called grumblegrits and corvina the blackrobed leader of the unbroken spine who addresses his followers like “a presidential candidate”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pages swell with mr sloan’s nerdy affection and youthful enthusiasm for both tangible books and new media</s>
<s>clay’s chatty narration maintains the pace and mr sloan injects dry wit and comedic timing suited to his geeky everyman</s>
<s>repeatedly clay’s wild imagination is undercut by a flash of selfdoubt and a reality check</s>
<s>he is an appealing hero precisely because he is not heroic</s>
<s>the ties that bind the story are friendship and vitality for life</s>
<s>this is a clever and whimsical tale with a big heart</s>
