<s>britain has seldom beat such a humiliating retreat in the face of superior numbers</s>
<s>on october 23rd the government suspended a controversial plan to cull badgers in two areas of southwest england after it emerged that twice as many lived there as it had thought</s>
<s>the marksmen hired to carry out the slaughter which was intended to contain the spread of bovine tuberculosis were to be paid per badger killed</s>
<s>thus in austerity britain the scheme was unaffordable</s>
<s>this was welcomed by animalrights activists including brian may a guitarist and some scientists who had questioned what good the cull would do</s>
<s>it disappointed farmers who were forced to slaughter 26000 infected cattle last year and quite possibly manufacturers of oldfashioned shaving brushes</s>
