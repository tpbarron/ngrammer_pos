<s>as young advisers in the 1990s david cameron and george osborne watched from the inside as sleaze corroded the last conservative government</s>
<s>those dark memories were stirred on march 25th when it was revealed that peter cruddas a wealthy financier who served as the tories cotreasurer had told journalists posing as potential donors that their money could secure access to the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the brazenness of mr cruddass pitch was bad enough he claimed that anything less than a £250000 $398000 donation was not “premier league” and suggested that generous givers could dine at downing street and contribute to its policy thinking</s>
<s>as the supposed donors were foreign and parties are forbidden to take money from abroad he advised them to donate via a britishbased company</s>
<s>he resigned from his tory post on the same day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the revelations were painfully timed</s>
<s>on march 21st mr osborne had delivered a contentious budget which was accused of favouring the rich by cutting the top rate of income tax</s>
<s>the conservatives image as the party of the rich has been reinforced at striking political cost</s>
<s>after months of roughly matching the labour party in opinion polls the tories now trail by as much as ten percentage points</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as no donation was given no law seems to have been broken</s>
<s>nevertheless after some resistance mr cameron has published a list of all big conservative donors who have dined with him in downing street or chequers his official rural retreat</s>
<s>he has also put an internal tory inquiry into the cruddas incident in the hands of lord gold a conservative lawyer rather than his initial choice of lord feldman an old friend who had appointed mr cruddas in the first place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all three major parties have been tainted by funding sleaze</s>
<s>labour was accused of offering “cash for honours” in office and still allows its tradeunion funders huge influence within the party</s>
<s>the liberal democrats took money from michael brown a convicted fraudster</s>
<s>some observers hope that the latest revelations might provide the shock needed to reform the whole system</s>
<s>talks between the parties which have been intermittent for the past five years are to restart—with francis maude the cabinet office minister and lord feldman leading for the tories</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the system is hard to change</s>
<s>last november sir christopher kelly of the independent committee on standards in public life suggested capping individual donations at £10000 allowing trade union members to “opt in” to their unions donations to labour and more public funding of parties</s>
<s>nobody was pleased</s>
<s>the tories wanted a higher cap whereas labour was uneasy about the restriction on unions</s>
<s>neither of the two main parties wants to be seen to support taxpayerfunded politics at a time of austerity nor do they think it realistic to generate more income by recruiting hundreds of thousands of new rankandfile members</s>
<s>sir christophers ideas got nowhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there might be a rational if unseemly calculation behind such inertia—namely that voters distrust all the parties roughly equally</s>
<s>britains antipolitics mood which predates even the parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009 is so vociferous that no party in particular suffers</s>
<s>only if the tories current dip in the polls endures might this perception shift</s>
<s>moreover it is not obvious that the lesson of mr cruddass indiscretion is that sweeping reform is needed</s>
<s>parties should not suggest to any donor that their money can buy influence or access</s>
<s>that does not require a radical rewriting of the rules but a more humdrum sense of right and wrong</s>
