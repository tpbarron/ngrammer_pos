<s>how did a few viennese economists persuade a grocer’s daughter a former film star and europe’s greatest chicken farmer to unravel 40 years of state expansion</s>
<s>how did a group of men dismissed as cranks and called neoliberals change world politics for good</s>
<s>daniel stedman jones is the latest writer to tackle the issue</s>
<s>his response is finer than most</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neoliberalism originated in austria</s>
<s>as governments fattened in britain and america in the 1940s three men started a lonely battle against the new collective politics</s>
<s>karl popper a philosopher and excommunist criticised thinkers from plato to marx who valued the collective over the individual</s>
<s>ludwig von mises an economist and former leftwinger said no bureaucracy had the means to restrain itself</s>
<s>friedrich hayek said central planning was impossible because no person however clever knew what people wanted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr stedman jones teases out the professorial squabbles</s>
<s>hayek and mises wanted their message to be radical</s>
<s>popper sought to woo as many as possible even liberals and socialists</s>
<s>no hardliner popper later saw flaws in market ideology comparing it to a religion</s>
<s>hayek ever the utopian pressed ahead</s>
<s>he started the mont pelerin society to foster his ideas</s>
<s>thus was neoliberalism founded</s>
<s>one hitch with writing about it is that the word is frequently misused today</s>
<s>leftists use “neoliberal” to describe people whom they essentially do not like</s>
<s>mr stedman jones seems to think the word should not be ditched the original pugilists against state control happily went by that name</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>milton friedman a chicago economist who headed the second wave of statebashers preferred the word “neoliberal” in a 1951 essay entitled “neoliberalism and its prospects”</s>
<s>he argued for a “middle way” between the enemy of collectivism and the excesses of 19thcentury liberalism</s>
<s>victorian liberals failed to grasp that laissezfaire could produce overmighty individuals friedman thought</s>
<s>the goal should not be laissezfaire but market competition this he said would protect men from each other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>friedman called for a new liberalism seeing himself as the heir to adam smith the 18thcentury defender of the individual</s>
<s>but the line between smith and friedman is not a straight one as mr stedman jones points out</s>
<s>smith thought one of the state’s jobs should be to build public works and forge institutions that would otherwise fail under market pressure</s>
<s>here he sounds more like franklin roosevelt</s>
<s>smith believed the state should fund schools bridges and roads</s>
<s>friedman said that was the job of the private sector</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neoliberals like friedman saw economic liberty as the safeguard of all freedoms a swelling state was the road to tyranny</s>
<s>smith by contrast was no democrat</s>
<s>less moved by political freedom he worried that mass suffrage would lead to instability</s>
<s>mises thought that smith was a man of his time with no opinions to offer on petrol rationing say</s>
<s>reading smith without studying economics he said was like reading euclid without studying maths</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hayek wrote that liberalism was too confusing a term since it had different meanings in victoria’s england and roosevelt’s america</s>
<s>but he refused to be called a libertarian too newfangled or a conservative he yearned for change</s>
<s>he preferred old whig to new liberal</s>
<s>friedman also tired of the label “neoliberal” perhaps because liberalism became tied to the grim culture wars of the 1960s</s>
<s>he happily deemed himself “laissezfaire” in 1976</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how did these ideas become mainstream</s>
<s>mr stedman jones a london barrister lays it out like a rugby match</s>
<s>the thinktanks pass to the journalists who pass to the politicians who with aid from the thinktanks run with it and score</s>
<s>the thinktanks were the most important</s>
<s>with lectures and publications they propagated ideas frowned upon at universities and converted the most powerful players in this revolution</s>
<s>margaret thatcher and ronald reagan counted themselves as inspired visitors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there is another reason</s>
<s>mr stedman jones says that if the 1970s had not been so caustic neoliberalism might have floundered</s>
<s>previous histories say neoliberals rose because of their political nous the force of their arguments and the network of institutions</s>
<s>anthony fisher the poultry farmer who founded the institute of economic affairs is praised as much as reagan’s speeches</s>
<s>these rightleaning tomes talk more of the heroes’ strengths than their rivals’ weaknesses</s>
<s>but the crisis of the 1970s stimulated new thinking too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“masters of the universe” is a little thin on character sketches and economics</s>
<s>but it is a strong work</s>
<s>mr stedman jones offers a novel and comprehensive history of neoliberalism</s>
<s>it is tarred neither by a reverence for the heroes nor by caricature for he is a fair and nuanced writer</s>
<s>this is a bold biography of a great idea</s>
