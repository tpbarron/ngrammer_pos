<s>tensions have grown in sri lanka between the executive and a beleaguered judiciary</s>
<s>they have prompted government claims of an international plot to pit one against the other as “in pakistan or bangladesh”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in september manjula tillekeratne the secretary of the judicial service commission alleged in a press release that efforts were being made to destroy the independence of the judiciary as well as the rule of law</s>
<s>the statement was unprecedented in the 40year history of the commission</s>
<s>the body is tasked with appointing transferring and dismissing judges and other court officials</s>
<s>it comprises the chief justice as chairman and two other supreme court judges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then on october 7th four unidentified men assaulted mr tillekeratne as he waited in his car for his children to finish their tennis lessons</s>
<s>one of the assailants pistolwhipped him while the others beat him with their fists and an iron rod</s>
<s>the attack took place on a public road in broad daylight in colombo the capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr tillekeratne had told journalists that his life was in danger soon after he had issued the statement on the commission’s instructions</s>
<s>the statement alleged that the commission was being threatened and intimidated by persons “holding different status”</s>
<s>it said members had been summoned but it did not reveal by whom</s>
<s>and it claimed the commission had documentary proof of how “relevant institutions” remained unconvinced about the importance of protecting the autonomy of the judiciary and commission</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the statement with its many opaque references was confusing</s>
<s>clarity soon came from an unlikely source president mahinda rajapaksa</s>
<s>he told reporters that it was his secretary who had called the commission for a meeting ostensibly to discuss budgetary allocations and training for judges</s>
<s>senior lawyers say it was more likely that the president had wanted to question the commission about the suspension of a certain districtcourt judge known to be close to the powerful rajapaksa clan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>relations between the chief justice shirani bandaranayake and the president are also strained</s>
<s>her husband pradeep kariyawasam is being investigated over a questionable share transaction effected while he was chairman of the stateowned national savings bank</s>
<s>the bribery commission is appointed by the president and is notoriously lethargic on highprofile complaints</s>
<s>but it has fasttracked the probe on this one</s>
<s>activists had initially questioned how mr kariyawasam could hold position in a government entity while his wife headed the country’s top court</s>
<s>but he has been forced to resign and legal practitioners now face open sniping between judiciary and executive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the assault on mr tillekeratne drew condemnation from abroad</s>
<s>the international commission of jurists urged the government to bring the perpetrators to justice and to ensure that judges were secure from assault and intimidation</s>
<s>in sri lanka district and magistrate court judges went on strike for two days in protest</s>
<s>hundreds of lawyers and supporters demonstrated</s>
<s>the government reacted by accusing ngos western governments and separatist forces of trying to destabilise the country—a familiar refrain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the standoff may yet grow more serious</s>
<s>on october 9th chamal rajapaksa the parliamentary speaker insisted that the supreme court had failed to comply with the constitution in the way it had conveyed a decision on a controversial bill to parliament</s>
<s>mr rajapaksa who is one of several brothers of the president in government said the court had erred in delivering the documents to the secretarygeneral of parliament and not to himself</s>
<s>this might be “muscleflexing” as one activist put it</s>
<s>but judges and lawyers appear inclined to flex right back</s>
