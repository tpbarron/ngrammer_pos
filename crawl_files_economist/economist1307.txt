<s>when the libertad an argentine frigate used for training naval cadets arrived in ghana on october 1st the 220 crew members and 110 students on board expected a warm welcome</s>
<s>they had been greeted by their national anthem in venezuela and invited to play a football match in portugal</s>
<s>but officials in the port of tema detained the ship executing a legal injunction obtained by an american hedge fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the libertad was the latest in a line of argentine assets that the government’s creditors have tried to snatch</s>
<s>in 2001 the country ceased payment on $81 billion of bonds</s>
<s>their price plunged letting riskseeking investors buy them for pennies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the buyers was a fund run by elliott management a new yorkbased outfit with a history of wringing money out of bankrupt countries</s>
<s>in 1996 it bought $11m of defaulted peruvian paper which allowed it to win $58m in court awards</s>
<s>soon after an elliott fund spent $23m on the debt of congobrazzaville</s>
<s>in 2005 it used this to intercept $39m from a state oil sale</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that same year argentina offered its creditors a bond swap in which they would suffer a 65 loss</s>
<s>in 2010 it opened a similar exchange for investors who had skipped the first round</s>
<s>holders of 93 of the debt accepted</s>
<s>but elliott insisted on full face value plus past due interest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a judge in new york has awarded elliott $16 billion in claims against argentina</s>
<s>however the government has refused to pay</s>
<s>although it has the money everyone who accepted its debtrestructuring would be entitled to sue it for better terms if it met the fund’s demands</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so elliott has put its lawyers to work</s>
<s>along with other holdouts it wrested control of $90m from a trustee holding shares for a privatised argentine bank and $23m from a leading mortgage bank</s>
<s>on its own it has obtained $33m from an account held by the science ministry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the holdouts have also targeted more tangible prizes such as the presidential plane</s>
<s>in 2010 argentina held back choice artworks from a festival in frankfurt for fear of german creditors</s>
<s>the government has tried to keep the libertad away from countries where it might be at risk</s>
<s>in ghana it seems to have miscalculated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>argentina has reacted furiously to the seizure</s>
<s>the government called the fund “unscrupulous” and a “vulture” and appealed against the injunction saying the ship is protected by diplomatic immunity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the time being however the libertad is deprived of its liberty</s>
<s>elliott is demanding that argentina post a court bond of at least $10m a low estimate of its value to let it go and will otherwise try to sell the vessel</s>
<s>paying off the holdouts would still be more expensive for argentina than continuing to flout them</s>
<s>but thumbing its nose looks increasingly costly</s>
