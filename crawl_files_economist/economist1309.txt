<s>the loan package was meant to fix spain’s woes</s>
<s>but on july 20th as the euro zone agreed a bailout of up to €100 billion $121 billion for its troubled banks the country’s borrowing costs rose dizzily</s>
<s>five days later the yield on tenyear bonds hit an unsustainable 775 while madrid’s stock exchange plunged to the levels of march 2003</s>
<s>talk of a bailout for the euro zone’s fourthbiggest economy grew louder see article</s>
<s>it would cost a frightening €385 billion to the end of 2014</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what went wrong</s>
<s>on the day the bank bailout was agreed valencia became the first of spain’s 17 semiautonomous regions to admit that it needs government help</s>
<s>the region has long been run by the centreright people’s party of mariano rajoy the premier but ministers were caught on the hop</s>
<s>with markets still open petrol had been thrown onto the blaze of doubt about spain’s finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a mix of recession sinking property prices bank failures and public profligacy—made worse by cronyism and corruption—is at the roots of valencia’s fall</s>
<s>but comunitat valenciana is by no means alone</s>
<s>it was soon followed by neighbouring murcia which will also apply for help from a special €18 billion liquidity fund set up by the government</s>
<s>more worryingly ramón luis valcárcel murcia’s president admitted that this year it will probably once more miss its deficit target</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>catalonia the wealthy eastern region that accounts for one fifth of output also suggested it needs the liquidity fund</s>
<s>unable to roll over debt or finance deficit spending at sustainable levels on the markets it is asking for help just when the central government is itself struggling to raise money at sustainable rates</s>
<s>more than a third of spain’s regions which jointly spend some 40 of public money may ultimately follow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>controlling regionalgovernment deficits is one of spain’s biggest headaches</s>
<s>the regions’ failure to control budgets defeated spain’s attempt to meet a 6 deficit target last year leaving it at 89</s>
<s>regions told to cut their combined deficit to 13 of gdp instead increased it to 34</s>
<s>valencia was among the worst offenders</s>
<s>its deficit climbed from 387 of regional gdp to 45</s>
<s>its debt is estimated to be 20 of regional gdp see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some regions are taking drastic steps</s>
<s>valencia has announced plans to sack threequarters of the staff some 1300 people at its bloated regional broadcaster</s>
<s>catalonia is on its fifth adjustment plan</s>
<s>but juan rubioramírez of the fedea thinktank’s regional observatory predicts that this year’s overshoot will nevertheless produce a joint 2 deficit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regional governments have every reason to behave</s>
<s>all had to present austerity budgets for the government’s approval</s>
<s>up to eight reportedly have already been warned that they are not sticking to them</s>
<s>those who drift too far face being invaded by the socalled “men in black”—budget ministry officials who will take direct control of their finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the immediate outlook for spain is deeply depressing</s>
<s>the government now sees recession stretching into 2013 with the economy shrinking by 05 next year</s>
<s>unemployment at 25 of the workforce is unlikely to come down</s>
<s>a recent €65 billion austerity package which triggered widespread public protest has failed to convince markets that spain is getting its finances under control</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>falling revenues and soaring bond yields are a toxic mixture</s>
<s>mr rajoy’s reformist government is desperate begging for more aid everywhere in europe as it is applying painful austerity measures</s>
<s>several ministers have been pleading for help from the european central bank ecb</s>
<s>after the ecb declined to buy spanish bonds josé manuel garcíamargallo the foreign minister branded the ecb a “clandestine” bank that is doing nothing to stop “the fire of public debt”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as so often in this crisis italy seems to be following in spain’s footsteps</s>
<s>it too has problems with local as well as regional administrations</s>
<s>two main dangers came into focus this week as mayors demonstrated outside parliament in rome and the central government imposed radical measures on the government of indebted sicily</s>
<s>the first worry is that provincial and municipal administrations might soon be knocking at the door of central government demanding funds to meet their statutory obligations</s>
<s>a spokesman for italy’s local councils said ten municipalities were now facing bankruptcy</s>
<s>and a representative of the provinces warned there were schools that might be unable to reopen in the autumn for lack of funds—a claim dismissed by the education minister in mario monti’s nonparty government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other potentially greater risk emanates from sicily’s precarious finances</s>
<s>on july 24th after a meeting with raffaele lombardo the governor of sicily mr monti acted to curb it</s>
<s>it was confirmed mr lombardo would resign at the end of the month and that rome would enforce a plan to clean up the sicilian government’s accounts and sort out its administration</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sicily is one of five italian regions out of 20 with special statutes that give them ample autonomy</s>
<s>it has estimated debts of €53 billion though mr lombardo says the island is owed money including by rome</s>
<s>and sicily is notorious for its extravagant administration</s>
<s>a report by the audit court last month found it had almost 18000 employee—five times as many as the regional government of lombardy which has twice the population</s>
<s>the governor had a bigger staff than the british prime minister</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how much cash rome will need to put into sicily remains to be seen</s>
<s>mr lombardo said he expected soon to receive transfers running to hundreds of millions of euros</s>
<s>but it is not clear how much had already been earmarked for the island</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>are there other sicilies waiting to be bailed out</s>
<s>matteo caroli of the luiss university in rome notes the central government has introduced draconian sanctions to force the regional administrations to balance their books</s>
<s>but he adds “these are processes that require time”</s>
<s>and in southern europe this week time appeared in alarmingly short supply</s>
