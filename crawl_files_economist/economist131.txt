<s>dominant economies have dominant currencies—britains until the second world war and americas ever since</s>
<s>chinas yuan isnt in that class yet but is venturing ever farther outside the domestic market</s>
<s>look for more forays in 2012</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the yuan is already a hot commodity in hong kong chinas financial laboratory</s>
<s>three years ago banks there had few yuan on deposit by late 2011 deposits were almost 600 billion yuan $94 billion</s>
<s>several foreign firms such as mcdonalds have floated yuan bonds in hong kong</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these are modest steps</s>
<s>chinas government in good times wants to keep hot money out and in bad times it wants to keep good money in</s>
<s>yet china is committed to making the yuan an international currency if only to lessen its dependence on the ropy dollar</s>
<s>what looked like a very long process is happening quickly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whats on the cards for 2012</s>
<s>china will make it easier for foreign institutional investors to bring offshore yuan back into the mainland and may grant higher investment quotas</s>
<s>china may also allow interest rates to rise and relax its rigid control of the exchange rate</s>
<s>finally look for foreign central banks to start holding a small portion of their foreignexchange reserves in yuan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of this means the yuan will soon become a global reserve currency</s>
<s>china is an economic superpower but in 2012 will still be a financial minnow</s>
