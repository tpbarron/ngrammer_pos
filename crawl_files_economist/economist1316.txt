<s>a new congressional report about huawei and zte two of china’s largest telecoms firms appears to have been written for vegetarians</s>
<s>at least there is not much meat in it</s>
<s>the study which was published on october 8th by the intelligence committee of the us house of representatives declares the firms a threat to america’s national security</s>
<s>yet it presents little hard evidence to support its recommendations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these are draconian</s>
<s>the committee calls for the chinese firms’ networking gear and any other kit containing their components to be excluded from all american government systems—and those of contractors working on them</s>
<s>it wants huawei and zte barred from buying any american companies</s>
<s>and it urges all american telecoms firms purchasing networking equipment to shun them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the report comes at a time of rising trade friction thanks to the election</s>
<s>it also underlines how deals involving hightech infrastructure are becoming politicised</s>
<s>australia has already blocked huawei from taking part in its countrywide broadband system on nationalsecurity grounds</s>
<s>canada hinted this week that huawei could be excluded from work on a new secure government network</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the congressional study frets that huawei’s and zte’s products could be used as trojan horses by chinese spooks</s>
<s>it makes much of the firms’ opaque governance and the fact that they have internal communist party committees as big chinese firms generally do</s>
<s>however it provides no evidence that these have influenced the firms’ behaviour</s>
<s>it drops hints that it has evidence from current and former huawei staff that some of its employees in america may have been involved in “potentially unethical or illegal behaviour”</s>
<s>but it fails to spell out what</s>
<s>the details are classified</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the committee’s investigators also cast doubts over huawei’s efforts to build trust in its products elsewhere</s>
<s>in britain for instance the firm has set up a centre where securitycleared staff some of whom used to work for britain’s signalsintelligence agency vet the networking kit and software that the chinese firm wishes to sell to telecoms companies there</s>
<s>bt a british firms that buys huawei equipment says that having the firm as a supplier has not jeopardised the security of its networks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>huawei and zte have proposed a similar approach in america working with outfits such as electronic warfare associates and other private firms that vet hightech gear for the us government</s>
<s>but the report says it is not clear yet that such steps would work in america</s>
<s>why not</s>
<s>it gives no convincing reason</s>
<s>instead it says that a telecoms supplier should offer “a convincing set of diverse evidence” that its system “is worthy of our trust”</s>
<s>such as</s>
<s>the report does not disclose</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>huawei which generates only tiny sales in america is not happy</s>
<s>“i can’t work with ifs buts and maybes” complains john suffolk huawei’s global cybersecurity officer and a former chief information officer for the british government</s>
<s>moreover the report glosses over the fact that many telecomsequipment makers such as sweden’s ericsson also source kit and components in china</s>
<s>“people might worry that huawei equipment is having malware put into it but one could have exactly the same concerns about ericsson’s equipment too” says pierre ferragu of sanford c bernstein a bank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a better approach as the economist has argued would be for governments to be crystal clear about the standards that all telecomsequipment suppliers must meet to win their business</s>
<s>instead america’s politicians appear to be indulging in technonationalism</s>
<s>“america likes to tell other governments not to meddle in technology and the internet but here we are becoming more like china” says douglas guthrie the dean of george washington university’s business school</s>
