<s>as a stiff aegean breeze fluttered the hair and lapels of angela merkel’s palegreen jacket one greek reporter thought the outfit looked familiar</s>
<s>the german chancellor making a oneday working visit to athens seemed to have picked the same jacket she wore in july while watching germany trounce greece 42 at this year’s european football championship</s>
<s>was mrs merkel planning to blast the greeks again this time for footdragging over economic reforms</s>

<s>antonis samaras the prime minister need not have worried</s>
<s>the european union’s toughest advocate of austerity gave a positive message even if it was typically cautious</s>
<s>mrs merkel said she hoped and wished that greece would remain a member of the euro zone praised the country’s progress with cutting expenditure and offered “practical” assistance with structural reforms such as german expertise on overhauling tax administration and modernising local government</s>

<s>the chancellor’s efforts to empathise with ordinary greeks suffering the pain of a fiveyear recession were less successful</s>
<s>hostile protesters outside parliament waved banners declaring “angela you are not welcome”</s>
<s>alexis tsipras leader of the radical leftwing syriza now the main opposition party in parliament joined the demonstration railing against “barbarous” measures imposed by international lenders</s>
<s>several municipal workers in full nazi uniform one of them with an adolf hitler moustache drove a jeep flying swastika flags through a central boulevard as a tasteless reminder of the german occupation of athens in the second world war</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at one point as riot police briefly used tear gas and stun grenades to block protesters from approaching the parliament building it looked as if the visit might backfire disastrously</s>
<s>shortly afterwards karolos papoulias the plainspeaking greek president told mrs merkel the greeks could not endure much more austerity</s>
<s>at a business gathering greece’s senior industrialist complained about pressure on athens to legislate a lower minimum monthly wage of €580 $747 aimed at making greek companies more competitive the chancellor said mildly she would consult the troika—the eu european central bank and imf officials working with the greek finance ministry on a new €135 billion austerity package</s>

<s>mr samaras’s approval rating at home may benefit from having hosted europe’s most powerful politician</s>
<s>even so he must wrap up the new economic package and persuade the socialist and leftwing party leaders his coalition partners to back it before the european summit on october 18th</s>
<s>he must also push the measures through parliament before greece can draw down a longoverdue €312 billion loan disbursement</s>
<s>for as long as government suppliers continue to be unpaid and banks undercapitalised the cashstarved economy has no prospect of moving again</s>

<s>the gap for 2014 is “fairly small” and could be closed within days barring an upset in talks with the troika negotiators say</s>
<s>greece should be able to balance its budget next year before interest repayments</s>
<s>yet if reforms start falling behind talk of a “grexit” from the euro will quickly resurface see charlemagne</s>
