<s>the sandy beaches of aberporth once a busy fishing port at the southern end of cardigan bay come into view as you descend to land in a light aircraft on the single asphalt runway of west wales airport</s>
<s>the place is quiet few passengers arrive here</s>
<s>but unlike any other airport in britain some of the planes parked nearby never have anyone on board</s>
<s>one is preparing to fly a grey pilotless aircraft resembling a giant cigar tube called watchkeeper</s>
<s>west wales is becoming a centre for unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and one of britain’s unlikeliest industrial clusters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ray mann who runs an engineering and recycling business based in rossonwye just over the english border had learnt to fly to save time travelling to factories in europe</s>
<s>noticing the small former air force base he inquired if it was possible to land his light aircraft there</s>
<s>later it turned out that the airport was for sale so mr mann bought it in 2001</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after several years trying to develop a “general aviation” airport for private planes mr mann concluded there was not enough demand</s>
<s>and there was a problem nearby in the form of delta 201 a 2000 squaremile danger area over cardigan bay that is used as a military range</s>
<s>but what about pilotless drones</s>
<s>uavs which are severely restricted or banned from other airports could fly there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so mr mann and his team extended the runway and provided other facilities to turn the airport into a centre of excellence for uav development</s>
<s>despite some opposition from locals the welsh assembly has backed the project developing business units and sponsoring changes to segregated airspace to enable uav operations from the airport</s>
<s>the staff in the control tower have created new operating procedures to allow the airport to remain open to general aviation when drones are not taking off or landing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a small cluster of companies is now emerging around the airport</s>
<s>they include qinetiq a british defence contractor which also manages the restricted airspace the british division of thales a french engineering group which is carrying out trials of watchkeeper for the british army and selex galileo a uav specialist owned by finmeccanica an italian group</s>
<s>the area is now ambitiously promoting itself as the national aeronautical centre</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>drones have been used heavily for military purposes in afghanistan and iraq but they could play a much bigger role in civil society</s>
<s>hundreds of uav projects are in the works around the world</s>
<s>backers hope they will prove a cheaper alternative to helicopters and fixedwing aircraft for tasks as varied as power and pipeline inspection mapping security border surveillance research filming fire fighting search and rescue and delivering supplies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the coming scramble into the air by civilian operators makes aviation authorities nervous about midair collisions and other accidents</s>
<s>permission to fly a civilian uav might only be granted if it remains in “line of sight” and capable of being controlled from the ground much like a model aircraft</s>
<s>beyond that britain’s civil aviation authority and others talk of the need for uavs to have systems enabling them to sense and avoid other aircraft</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such systems will have to be developed and tested somewhere which mr mann hopes will land him more business</s>
<s>this is how innovation centres come into being from a combination of circumstance and entrepreneurship</s>
<s>it is how the far mightier silicon valley emerged with a big defence industry spinning off startup firms</s>
<s>nobody knows when a civilian uav industry will take off</s>
<s>but when it does a small airport in wales could be at the forefront of the next revolution in aviation</s>
