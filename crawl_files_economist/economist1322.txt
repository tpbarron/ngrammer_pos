<s>few industries have worse labour relations than american professional sports</s>
<s>on september 15th the owners of the national hockey league locked out their players after failing to agree on a new contract</s>
<s>fans howled that the entire 201213 ice hockey season might be lost as it was in 200405</s>
<s>this is the fourth nhl lockout or strike since 1992 and follows lockouts by owners of teams in the national basketball association nba and national football league nfl in 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the hockey tiff is about money</s>
<s>players refuse to accept a cap on salaries of 47 of revenues down from 57</s>
<s>owners say the cap is needed to help weaker teams compete</s>
<s>hockey has the widest income disparity of the “big four” of american football baseball basketball and ice hockey each nhl team depends mostly on cash it generates locally</s>
<s>in the nfl far more revenues are pooled</s>
<s>this prevents a few superrich teams from dominating and in theory makes the game more exciting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when muscular millionaires the players fight brash billionaires the owners neither side will crumple easily</s>
<s>all are alpha males most can forgo income for a long time</s>
<s>so the lockout could drag on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the global army of superrich has grown more tycoons have bought sports teams for fun or prestige</s>
<s>many have lost squillions</s>
<s>few seem to care</s>
<s>roman abramovich a russian gazillionaire started a craze for foreigners buying english soccer clubs when he snapped up chelsea in 2003</s>
<s>since then he has bought stars like normal people buy starbucks coffee—eagerly often and with little regard to the price tag</s>
<s>and he is far from alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>men sometimes buy teams thinking ownership will attract women says diane garnick ceo of clear alternatives an investment firm</s>
<s>however they soon find that it primarily attracts other men and could even repel women who assume that a sportsmad plutocrat will spend little time with them outside the ballpark</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stocks for jocks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite all these peculiarities the market for sport teams has become far more efficient in the past decade or so says steve flatow of bloomberg sports which provides data and analysis to the sports industry</s>
<s>one reason is that a crowd of banking and consulting intermediaries has appeared to advise owners on how to make bucks from balls and pucks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another is that sports broadcasts are growing more valuable</s>
<s>no other form of entertainment persuades viewers to tune in so reliably at a specific time nor to watch a show live rather than recording and skipping the adverts</s>
<s>this means that sports teams are worth more than ever says will chang a serial investor in teams such as the san francisco giants baseball and dc united soccer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when a consortium of tycoons—including magic johnson a former basketball star—bought the los angeles dodgers baseball team for $21 billion this year most observers including mr chang thought they had overpaid</s>
<s>yet the chance to bag a lucrative new television deal now suggests the new owners may do well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ten most valuable sports teams in the world are worth a combined $16 billion according to forbes</s>
<s>that is up from $144 billion a year ago—an 11 increase at a time of worldwide economic sluggishness</s>
<s>two soccer teams top the list manchester united and real madrid</s>
<s>joint third are the new york yankees a baseball team and the dallas cowboys an americanfootball team</s>
<s>of the 50 most valuable teams ranked by forbes 41 are american including all 32 nfl teams</s>
<s>some see this as evidence that the american professionalsports industry is overpriced</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed some businesslike owners are starting to get out</s>
<s>in august randy lerner an investor with a reputation for prudence sold the cleveland browns football team for $1 billion</s>
<s>on september 18th it emerged that philip anschutz is exploring selling aeg his multibilliondollar sports and entertainment business</s>
<s>aeg owns several teams including the la galaxy which brought david beckham an english soccer star to america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr anschutz was quick to spot the potential for using stadiums for nonsporting purposes and has built up a musicmanagement arm of aeg which represents stars such as justin bieber and jennifer lopez</s>
<s>potential bidders for aeg or just its sports teams range from the dolan family which owns the new york knicks basketball team to comcast a media firm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there have been rumours too that john henry of the fenway sports group will sell the boston red sox</s>
<s>some speculate that he will buy a cheaper rival baseball team or pump more money into liverpool an english soccer team he bought for $476m in october 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr henry may be the canniest mogul of all</s>
<s>he helped the red sox win the world series in 2004 the first time in 86 years partly by adopting the quantitative methods described in “moneyball” a book by michael lewis that became a brad pitt film</s>
<s>simply put don’t hire the best players</s>
<s>hire the ones who offer the best value for money</s>
<s> mr henry paid $700m for the red sox and the new england sports network in 2001 forbes reckons the team alone is now worth at least $1 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr henry says the rumour that he is about to sell the red sox is baseless</s>
<s>yet there are reasons to sell</s>
<s>the sox are having a lousy season</s>
<s>a rich fan may believe he can use his business skills to revive it</s>
<s>such an investor could pay over the odds for a chance at the bragging rights</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are also reasons for mr henry to shift cash to liverpool which could use a striker who actually scores goals</s>
<s>some american sports moguls see english soccer’s premier league as the best current opportunity to transfer abroad their knowledge of how to make money from a sports franchise</s>
<s>china and india are good places to sell merchandise but so corrupt that owning a team is a risky bet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>five of the 20 english premiership teams are owned by americans mr lerner aston villa the glazer family manchester united stan kroenke arsenal and ellis short sunderland as well as mr henry</s>
<s>he bought liverpool from two other american investors george gillett and tom hicks who had burdened the team with debt and left it nearly bankrupt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the money available to the best english soccer teams is growing fast</s>
<s>in june the domestic rights to televise premiership games for 201316 were auctioned for $5 billion a 71 increase on the previous deal</s>
<s>a forthcoming auction of foreign rights may raise even more says stefan szymanski an economist at the university of michigan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the problem for profitmaximising americans is that they must vie for trophies with even richer foreigners who don’t mind losing money</s>
<s>mansour bin zayed al nahyan an emirati sheikh who bought manchester city in 2008 makes even mr abramovich seem stingy which is why the club won the premiership in may</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the best hope for american investors may be that new “financial fair play” rules now being introduced across europe will rein in lavish spending and create a de facto cap on players’ salaries says mr szymanski</s>
<s>yet it may not be clear for several years if these rules will be enforced with enough rigour to give moneyball a sporting chance against munificence</s>
