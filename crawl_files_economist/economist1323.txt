<s>union bashing tough talk on welfare and short shrift for criminals—in many ways it was a conventional conservative party conference</s>
<s>but away from the main stage in gatherings of mps and grassroots activists the conference buzzed with big ideas</s>
<s>“we are sceptical of politics driven by focus groups” asserts kwasi kwarteng a tory mp</s>
<s>with four other members of the free enterprise group mr kwarteng has just published a tract of radical freemarket policies designed to shift opinion</s>
<s>his was not the only outfit aiming to cause a stir</s>
<s>in his closing speech david cameron tried to define what the conservative party stands for see bagehot</s>
<s>at times it felt as if everybody else at the conference was vying to do the same</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pressure groups of tory politicians and activists are multiplying</s>
<s>conservative voice launched in september to champion traditional policies on crime immigration and jobs now claims thousands of supporters</s>
<s>bright blue campaigns for “progressive conservatism” and pushes causes such as environmentalism and international development</s>
<s>mps representing marginal constituencies last year formed the forty to devise strategies for the 2015 election</s>
<s>and so on</s>
<s>pamphlets and books are whizzing off the presses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>five strains of thought can be detected</s>
<s>first come the two subtly different varieties of david cameron’s “modernising” project which seeks to anchor the party in the electorally decisive centre ground</s>
<s>cautious reformers including the prime minister himself are at home in modern britain but nostalgic about traditional institutions</s>
<s>radical reformers including george osborne the chancellor of the exchequer and much of the 2010 intake of mps are more socially and economically liberal and often more urban</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>three other strains are less influential</s>
<s>the pitiful remnants of the party’s oncestrong left wing economically interventionist and relaxed about europe huddle around the tory reform group</s>
<s>better represented among the party grassroots are the social conservatives and the libertarians</s>
<s>the former mostly close to the cornerstone group were out in force at an antigaymarriage rally on the conference fringe</s>
<s>the latter are defined by hawkish views on taxes and foreign policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tory tribes are particularly vivid and noisy these days</s>
<s>public disagreement between conservatives and liberal democrats at the heart of the coalition government as well as a widespread belief among tory mps that lib dems are steering the ship has made dissent seem more acceptable</s>
<s>one senior liberal democrat compares coalition to an xray machine it exposes the fractures beneath a party’s skin</s>
<s>coalition also diminishes mr cameron’s powers of patronage such as cabinet seats with which to buy off agitators</s>
<s>the tribal gatherings are outlets for energy that in past conservative administrations was channelled into government business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and there is a lot of energy in the party these days</s>
<s>the tories’ 2010 intake which makes up 48 of the parliamentary party contains fewer intellectually mediocre patricians than its predecessors</s>
<s>many new mps have extensive professional experience outside politics</s>
<s>before the last general election mr cameron meddled with candidateselection procedures to enhance social and ethnic diversity</s>
<s>in the process he produced a more independent opinionated crop of tory mps</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the broadly loyal culture of the party means its tribes are not nearly as dangerous as they might seem</s>
<s>whereas labour periodically breaks into warring dogmatic factions conservatives are generally united by a broad set of common principles—including a sceptical attitude to grand political schemes</s>
<s>one trenchant backbench critic acknowledges that many tory mps “usually follow the prevailing pattern”</s>
<s>even on europe a topic that has caused infighting in the past there is little sign of factionalism</s>
<s>the party is almost uniformly eurosceptic although some are hotter than others and there are differences over the timing of any referendum on the eu</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beating the drum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the tribes are important and revealing of the conservative party’s state</s>
<s>tim bale author of two books on the party after 1945 notes that cliques have previously shifted the entire conservative encampment</s>
<s>in the 1950s the one nation group swung the party behind a mixed economy</s>
<s>under margaret thatcher cerebral mps around the centre for policy studies led it the other way</s>
<s>mr cameron rose to the leadership on the shoulders of a small number of young ambitious modernisers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>successful cliques have several things in common</s>
<s>they tend to have a succinct analysis of how and why the party needs to change</s>
<s>they have a knack for pr and a strong grasp of the prevailing mood</s>
<s>they know that they have to say something repeatedly before the party—let alone the country—will listen</s>
<s>they have an electoral strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at present the radical modernisers are best placed to steer the party</s>
<s>the free enterprise group seen as their vanguard has a simple message government should remove barriers in the way of business</s>
<s>dominated by mediasavvy professional types it knows how to communicate this mantra</s>
<s>it has mr osborne’s ear as well as some support from other tendencies in the party</s>
<s>it seems to be swaying the leader mr cameron’s speech this week was big on businessworship</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in many ways the ferment within the conservative party is beneficial</s>
<s>one new centreleft mp praises a fine “buffet” of different approaches a backbench grandee talks of the value of “safety valves” on hot issues</s>
<s>there is a refreshingly relaxed view towards rival philosophies which was notably absent from the labour party when it was in power</s>
<s>a combination of loyalty and flexibility has served the conservative party well in the past</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the growing din of opinionated voices is a bad sign for the leadership</s>
<s>it is no coincidence that several new groups have appeared recently at a time when the government has tripped over health reform deficit reduction and constitutional change and the conservative party has fallen further behind labour in opinion polls</s>
<s>the absence of a clear direction from the top of the party has created a space into which alternative proposals are pouring</s>
<s>the party as a whole is fizzing because 10 downing street is not</s>
