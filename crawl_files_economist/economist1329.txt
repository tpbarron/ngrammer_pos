<s>university funding in britain has become a serious problem that government of any persuasion has to address</s>
<s>but it is not being addressed properly</s>
<s>decades of cuts coupled with increasing numbers of students have brought the system into crisis</s>
<s>several bottomtier institutions are functionally bankrupt several of the toptier universities have for some years been thinking about going private on the american model because the difficulties caused by chronic government underfunding are no longer manageable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the current fee increase to £6000plus annually with a £9000 $14000 cap is a stopgap</s>
<s>those sums are politically chosen they do not represent a realistic response to universities needs</s>
<s>now that the public purse can no longer support higher education fully the day is looming when the true cost of a university education will have to be borne by its direct beneficiaries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>part of the coalition governments strategy is to allow private providers to enter the field</s>
<s>in line with market theory the thought is that private providers will undercut the publicly funded mainstream universities by offering cheaper and shorter degree courses forcing the mainstream universities to find ways to lower costs—and therefore fees—and to follow suit in devising shorter and more vocational degree courses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but this way of liberalising higher education offers an appalling prospect</s>
<s>it will drive down quality despite any regime of supervision attempted through regulation</s>
<s>this will compromise the uk brand of higher education which until now has been a strong one</s>
<s>the eccentric result will be to have highquality highpriced private providers at the secondaryeducation level—the independent schools—and lowquality lowpriced private providers at the tertiary level</s>
<s>these private providers will compete with struggling publicly subsidised providers trying with ever greater difficulty to survive</s>
<s>the cheap private providers will be a drag on publicprovider quality the bad will drive out the good</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of this the government should be encouraging highquality independent highereducation providers—like my own new college of the humanities which will open its doors to students in 2012—to exist alongside the publicly subsidised ones with each type competing on quality not cost</s>
<s>government support for independent providers should not consist in funding that should all go to the public universities but in making it possible for them to exist</s>
<s>the regulatory regime for university status which has vat and overseasstudentvisa advantages and for the granting of degreeawarding powers dap militates against new providers of any kind coming into the market because a candidate institution has to exist for four years with a high number of students before it can be considered yet a wouldbe independent university college reliant on fee income cannot attract students unless it can offer degrees</s>
<s>so its catch22 it can begin to exist only if it already exists</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a level paying field</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such a provider can however exist if it offers the degrees of another institution possessing dap</s>
<s>this is indeed a way forward</s>
<s>but it does not allow the new institution to be as innovative as it would wish in its differentiating offer to students</s>
<s>this is especially so if as is likely when its aim is quality it is more expensive than publicly funded universities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the key to licensing new providers should be their academics</s>
<s>if a new institution gathers a highly qualified and distinguished academic staff this staff should be counted as the entity which gets dap</s>
<s>it is an anomaly that colleges which succeed in ticking regulatory boxes over a period of time can have dap independently of rigorous requirements on staff quality</s>
<s>refocusing the bureaucracy of university regulation is the first step to ensuring a diversity of provision which competes on quality rather than cost</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>universities should be in the business of excellence not social engineering</s>
<s>but to ensure that gifted individuals from all backgrounds get to university because of their brains and not their purses there should be full public scholarships for university study</s>
<s>both independent and publicly funded institutions should be helped through tax breaks to raise endowments to assist students</s>
<s>no such scheme could put much of a dent in the national finances but it would be a major boost to gifted students from poor backgrounds</s>
<s>and this is a necessity if we are to begin to create americanstyle ivy league independent universities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all crises viewed aright are opportunities</s>
<s>if the politicians would stop playing politics with higher education and would create an environment in which quality of provision is the overriding determinant the current problems would turn into their own solution </s>
