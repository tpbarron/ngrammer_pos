<s>in his first appearance before parliament last month mariano rajoy spains new prime minister said he had no intention of raising taxes</s>
<s>only eleven days later on december 30th he brought in thumping tax rises on income savings and property</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was the sort of ploy mr rajoys socialist predecessor josé luis rodríguez zapatero who preferred indirect taxes never dared to make not least because mr rajoys rightwing peoples party pp would have accused him of bleeding middleclass wageearners dry</s>
<s>but in the backtofront world of budget deficits principle is often the first casualty</s>
<s>in 2010 mr zapatero himself executed a famous uturn freezing pensions raising the retirement age cutting civilservice pay and imposing austerity on regional governments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr rajoys switch will turn spain into one of europes highesttax countries</s>
<s>the top incometax rate will jump by seven points to 52 although few spaniards declare an income above the €300000 $390000 threshold</s>
<s>then there are regional topups</s>
<s>catalonia for example will now tax high earners at 56</s>
<s>in europe only sweden has a higher rate</s>
<s>even those at the bottom of the income scale will see tax rises</s>
<s>taxes on savings will also go up</s>
<s>and property taxes paid to town halls will rise for richer owners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the left cuts benefits and the right raises taxes something has gone wrong</s>
<s>in this case it is spains budget deficit which missed its 2011 target of 6 of gdp by a mile</s>
<s>nobody yet knows how bad the overshoot is but the government says the outcome could be 8 or more see chart</s>
<s>that would mean mr zapateros government managed barely onethird of the task of cutting it from the 2010 figure of 93</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr rajoys government wants to avoid being prodded by bond markets or nagged by angela merkel the german chancellor</s>
<s>but its task is getting harder by the day</s>
<s>the deficit target for 2012 agreed with the european union is 44 of gdp</s>
<s>given 2011s missed target that leaves a gap of close to €40 billion to be filled</s>
<s>the new taxes will cover only €63 billion of that</s>
<s>another €89 billion will come from spending cuts</s>
<s>but all that accounts for only half the hole</s>
<s>spains sales tax—at 18 low by european standards—may come in for scrutiny</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>expect more announcements in the coming days says cristóbal montoro the treasury minister</s>
<s>these will include structural reforms to encourage growth</s>
<s>“the government has an aggressive reform programme” says luis de guindos the new finance minister</s>
<s>but the gaping sore of unemployment at 23 by far the highest in the eu is likely to worsen before it improves</s>
<s>december saw yet another rise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bad news continues to pour in</s>
<s>the socialsecurity system is in the red for the first time since 1999</s>
<s>something must be done about the banks see article</s>
<s>andrew benito of goldman sachs thinks the economy will shrink by 15 this year</s>
<s>spain risks a downward spiral in which fiscal tightening harms growth putting further pressure on public finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reining in the deficit depends largely on regional governments</s>
<s>the central government says they accounted for most of 2011s overshoot</s>
<s>catalonia will be less of a burden this year but other big regions like andalusia and valencia may be tougher to tame</s>
<s>both are immersed in corruption scandals and concerns about probity will spook financial markets</s>
<s>happily most regions are now in pp hands socialistrun andalusia holds an election in march</s>
<s>mr rajoys new broom will have to be employed vigorously</s>
