<s>like drinkers in an english pub who crowd the bar well before the bell is rung for last orders europes banks are jostling to get to the front of the queue to raise extra capital</s>
<s>italys ubi banca tapped markets for €1 billion $14 billion at the end of march</s>
<s>this week intesa sanpaolo the countrys secondlargest bank said it would raise €5 billion</s>
<s>germanys commerzbank has also joined the rush announcing plans on april 6th to gather €83 billion by selling shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>other italian banks will be under pressure to follow</s>
<s>first among them may be monte dei paschi di siena which is expected to raise about €2 billion</s>
<s>unicredit italys biggest bank hopes to sit this round out</s>
<s>it is pointing investors to its core tier1 ratio of 86 a healthy enough figure but one that may begin to look anaemic as the average held by other italian banks ratchets up</s>
<s>the last time unicredit needed capital the libyan sovereignwealth fund was happy to oblige</s>
<s>its stake of 76 is now frozen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ostensible reason for the rush is that the italians want to meet the new capital requirements of basel 3 immediately instead of waiting until 2019 when all the rules will finally be in force</s>
<s>europes latest round of stress tests provides another incentive to boost buffers</s>
<s>so does the sovereigndebt crisis banks are paying over the odds to borrow in wholesale markets because of worries about the effect of debt restructuring and italys own creditworthiness</s>
<s>since writedowns are absorbing about half of italian banks operating profits they have less chance of building up capital via retained profits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>commerzbank has a different goal to pay off the german governments hybrid capital although the government will provide some of the funds itself by subscribing to the rights issue</s>
<s>but the banks core tier1 capital ratio will fall to 88 as a result of the repayment</s>
<s>investors will hope that commerzbank does not end up wanting another round later</s>
