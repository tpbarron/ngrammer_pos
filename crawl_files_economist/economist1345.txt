<s>the world’s most valuable resource is talent</s>
<s>no country grows enough of it</s>
<s>some however enjoy the colossal advantage of being able to import it</s>
<s>rich peaceful countries can attract clever immigrants</s>
<s>unlike other useful imports they cost the recipient country nothing</s>
<s>they come they study they work they set up businesses they create jobs 40 of the founders of fortune 500 companies are immigrants and their children</s>
<s>yet they are only 23 of americans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet for more than a decade america has been choking off its supply of foreign talent like a scuba diver squeezing his own breathing tube</s>
<s>it has done so in three ways</s>
<s>first it issues too few visas to skilled workers no more than 65000 a year down from more than 100000 in 1999</s>
<s>second it makes the process of applying for permanent residency slow and unpredictable</s>
<s>when vivek wadhwa an indian computer scientist arrived in the 1980s it took him 18 months to obtain a green card</s>
<s>now as mr wadhwa describes in a new book “the immigrant exodus” it often takes ten years</s>
<s>while in limbo wouldbe immigrants cannot switch jobs without jeopardising their place in the queue and their spouses are often barred from working</s>
<s>many give up and go elsewhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third america gives foreigners little credit for being entrepreneurs</s>
<s>for example anand and shikha chhatpar two indian engineers educated in america founded a company called fame express</s>
<s>it makes facebook game apps that more than 20m people have played</s>
<s>the chhatpars employed people in america and paid $250000 in american taxes in two years</s>
<s>but this was not good enough</s>
<s>their visa application was denied so they moved their headquarters to india</s>
<s>they are not alone</s>
<s>according to the kauffman foundation a thinktank in missouri the proportion of silicon valley startups with an immigrant founder has fallen from 52 to 44 since 2005</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>other countries see an opportunity</s>
<s>canada australia and singapore make it quick and painless for brainy foreigners to obtain visas to work or set up companies</s>
<s>even chile is luring some of the talent that america rejects</s>
<s>a remote emerging market with little tradition of innovation might seem an unlikely place to try to build a technology hub</s>
<s>but startup chile a local programme to encourage entrepreneurs is doing rather well as our silicon valley correspondent reports from santiago see article</s>
<s>an entrepreneur with a good idea can get a visa in a couple of weeks</s>
<s>since 2010 when startup chile began it has attracted some 500 companies run by whizzkids from 37 countries</s>
<s>many of those who flock to chilecon valley as it has been dubbed would rather have gone to america but couldn’t face a decade of immigration humiliation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chile or california</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>santiago is hardly a paradise for entrepreneurs</s>
<s>chile’s domestic market is small its bankruptcy law punitive</s>
<s>private venture capital is still rare and credit costly</s>
<s>in a sad irony chilean bureaucrats are trying to shut down a lowinterest lending market set up by the founder of startup chile</s>
<s>and although the programme to attract foreign entrepreneurs is promising other government initiatives in that area—such as offering $40000 grants to startups—are less sensible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still the main lesson from chilecon valley is that clever people have choices</s>
<s>america ought to be winning the global war for talent but thanks to its immigration rules it is fighting with both hands cuffed</s>
<s>presidential candidates take note</s>
