<s>europe’s biggest economy has its bittiest banking system</s>
<s>germany’s threepillar banking sector comprises savings banks cooperative banks and private banks</s>
<s>apart from a handful of big institutions such as deutsche bank commerzbank and hypovereinsbank hvb which is part of the italianowned unicredit group the lenders are parochial</s>
<s>that seemed antiquated once</s>
<s>it now looks less stickinthemud than it did</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two of the pillars—the 423 savings banks and 1116 cooperative banks—have come through the crisis with barely a scratch so far</s>
<s>each of these sectors already has a system of joint and several liability which means that no individual member bank is allowed to go bust</s>
<s>neither wants to become part of a wider european banking union in which guarantees extend to weak peripheral banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they argue that their business model working for the public or mutual good rather than for shareholders is well suited to the mixture of households and small companies known as the mittelstand that they serve</s>
<s>that seems to be borne out by their lending record since 2007</s>
<s>private banks reduced their medium and longterm lending to companies and households between 2007 and 2012 in favour of shortterm loans the savings and cooperative banks increased theirs see chart</s>
<s>it helps of course that germany’s economy has been performing well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the savings banks and cooperative banks provide about twothirds of all lending to mittelstand companies and 43 of lending to all companies and households</s>
<s>the landesbanken which act as wholesale banks for the savings banks and dz bank and wgz bank which do the same for the cooperative banks step in to provide more sophisticated services such as hedging and offshore financing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not everything is rosy in the garden</s>
<s>the landesbanken are a tale of woe</s>
<s>they raised as much money as they could before a 2005 deadline which ended their ability to issue debt under public guarantee and then had to find ways of investing the proceeds</s>
<s>they scooped up structured credit products which later turned out to be toxic they also overreached themselves with badly managed debt and equity investments in regions where they had little expertise</s>
<s>westdeutsche landesbank the most ambitious was finally wound up in june at a cost of €21 billion $268 billion to its public owners</s>
<s>bayerische landesbank after some disastrous attempts to expand in central europe is struggling to pay off €5 billion of state aid</s>
<s>only three landesbanken have the beginnings of a natural deposit and customer base</s>
<s>the rest are barely making money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the private banks the third pillar of the system also have several black marks against them</s>
<s>apart from deutsche which is one of the few survivors among the global investment and commercial banks the other big german banks have proved remarkably accidentprone</s>
<s>since 2007 germany has endured the nearcollapse of ikb a partly stateowned industriallending bank the rescue by nationalisation of hypo real estate and the partnationalisation of commerzbank weighed down by its illadvised purchases of eurohypo in 2005 and of dresdner bank in 2008</s>
<s>on november 8th commerzbank announced another disappointing set of results and warned of even weaker profits in the fourth quarter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some worry that the german banking system still has vulnerabilities</s>
<s>the ten biggest banks have a €43 billion exposure to the government debt of peripheral eurozone members</s>
<s>as they retrench to their domestic market they face decreasing margins because of fiercer competition</s>
<s>and if the overall system is still rather small by european standards—banks’ assets are equivalent to 160 of gdp compared with 336 for france and 556 for britain—deutsche bank is very large and less well capitalised than its global peers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even so officials are wary of proposals like that recently put forward by erkki liikanen the governor of the bank of finland to divide european banks’ riskier activities from their retailbanking activities</s>
<s>if such a split involved having to fund investment banking on a standalone basis deutsche bank would find it more expensive</s>
<s>hvb which does capitalmarkets business for the wider unicredit group might have a problem too</s>
<s>commerzbank has already separated investment banking from commercial banking it says so ringfencing would be mainly cosmetic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such extra costs to banks are unlikely greatly to impair big german companies’ access to finance or investmentbanking services</s>
<s>many other global banks are competing for their business although they too are facing higher costs</s>
<s>but even those politicians who have called for the ringfencing of banks have indicated that they do not want to see deutsche bank broken up</s>
<s>deutsche has for decades been part of the fabric of the german economy any banking reform from brussels which puts the integrity of the national flagcarrier at risk is likely to get short shrift in berlin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a decade from now deutsche bank may well be the only german bank to survive as an international name</s>
<s>but germany’s influence may spread in other ways</s>
<s>just as other countries are already setting up public industrial banks along the lines of the frankfurtbased kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau the model of a localised and diverse banking system is likelier to win adherents than it once was</s>
