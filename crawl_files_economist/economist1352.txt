<s>during palaniappan chidambaram’s second stint as india’s finance minister in january 2007 india had the satisfaction of getting a creditrating upgrade</s>
<s>after a bout of fast growth and encouraging noises from the government about its finances standard  poor’s sp boosted india’s rating to bbb the lowest rung of investment grade</s>
<s>today on his third stint running the ministry of broken dreams mr chidambaram must stop a lurch back to “junk” status</s>
<s>both sp and fitch warned earlier this year that they might lower india’s score given slow growth a lack of reform and high borrowing</s>
<s>on october 10th sp reiterated there was at least a oneinthree chance of a downgrade</s>
<s>moody’s a third agency is less grumpy</s>

<p>
<s>a downgrade would not in itself cause a crisis</s>
<s>the governmentbond market is dominated by local banks and insurance firms which are forced to buy thanks to liquidity and solvency rules</s>
<s>they will hoover up bonds whatever their rating</s>
<s>the central bank is buying freely too</s>
<s>it owns 18 of all government bonds almost double the level of two years ago</s>
<s>indian firms are perfectly capable of operating abroad if a downgrade happens</s>
<s>tata sons’ takeover of corus a british steel firm was plotted when sp rated india “junk”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still an investmentgrade rating is handy if like india you run a currentaccount deficit and hope to attract foreigners to help finance your vast infrastructure needs over the next decade</s>
<s>in september the government announced a batch of reforms designed to shore up confidence for example by relaxing rules for foreign supermarkets</s>
<s>mr chidambaram who took up his post in august has tried to maintain momentum by among other things hinting he will reverse a retroactive tax on vodafone a telecoms firm</s>
<s>tim geithner america’s treasury secretary gamely hailed the changes as “very significant”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in response indian shares and the rupee have leapt</s>
<s>foreign portfolio investors have rushed in</s>
<s>and the best proxy for india’s sovereign risk—the creditdefaultswap premium on debt issued by state bank of india a statebacked lender—has fallen to less scary levels see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but whether india has really got its house in order and been saved from a return to junk status is less clear</s>
<s>the biggest worry is the public finances</s>
<s>they have a distinctly european feel even if india is still growing faster than most countries the latest imf estimate for 2012 is 49</s>
<s>the deficit including the states is about 9 of gdp and gross debt stands at almost 70</s>
<s>india is in far worse shape than other big emerging economies with similar ratings</s>
<s>during the gogo years that could be overlooked because the debttogdp ratio was still falling thanks to rapid growth</s>
<s>no longer</s>
<s>the imf now forecasts that india’s ratio barely dips over the next halfdecade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>talk is cheap on fiscal matters in india</s>
<s>a decade ago the country put in place a legal framework to make politicians run a tighter ship</s>
<s>they ignored it</s>
<s>so far the government has only flirted with decisive action</s>
<s>it has made a tweak to fuel subsidies that was as politically painful as it was financially marginal</s>
<s>it has welcomed the report of a committee of the great and good that warned of a repeat of the financial crisis of 1991</s>
<s>what it has not yet done is act a task made harder by national elections due by 2014 which will lead to pressure to spend</s>
<s>if mr chidambaram manages material cuts to borrowing levels despite the electoral timetable he will surely save india’s credit rating—and rewrite the political rule book</s>
