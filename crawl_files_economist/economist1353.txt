<s>young mums shopping in the copley mall in downtown boston last month found themselves being questioned about their use of soap by students from harvard business school</s>
<s>the students were not doing odd jobs to earn beer money</s>
<s>they were preparing to help a firm in brazil launch an antibacterial cleanser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fieldwork—ie going out and talking to people—is a big change for hbs</s>
<s>its students used to sit in a classroom and discuss case studies written by professors</s>
<s>now they may also work in a developing country and launch a startup</s>
<s>“learning by doing” will become the norm if a radical overhaul of the mba curriculum succeeds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 900 students arriving in boston this summer for their twoyear course were told they would be guinea pigs</s>
<s>the new practical addition to hbss curriculum is known as “field” field immersion experiences for leadership development</s>
<s>not all the staff and students are overjoyed to be experimented on</s>
<s>but the man responsible nitin nohria who became dean of hbs in july 2010 says that “if it works the field method could become an equal partner to the case method”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>long before he became dean mr nohria lamented the failure of business schools to fulfil their mission of turning management into a profession similar to law or medicine</s>
<s>asked what should be expected from someone with an mba he replies that “obviously they should master a body of knowledge</s>
<s>but we should also expect them to apply that knowledge with some measure of judgment” mba students have long been sent on summer internships with prospective employers but hbs like most business schools did little else to help them with the practical application of management studies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what happens in the second year of the new course is still being worked out</s>
<s>but the first year has three elements</s>
<s>first teambuilding exercises</s>
<s>students take turns to lead a group engaged in a project such as designing an “ecofriendly sculpture”</s>
<s>they learn to collaborate and to give and take feedback</s>
<s>these exercises are loosely based on ones used in the us army</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second students will be sent to work for a week with one of more than 140 firms in 11 countries</s>
<s>already the new intake have had conference calls with these companies ranging from the brazilian soapmaker to a chinese property firm and gone offcampus to conduct productdevelopment “dashes” like the one in copley mall</s>
<s>this sort of structured learningbydoing is a world away from hbss traditional encouragement of students to “go on an adventure” outside of classes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the third novel part of the course students will be given eight weeks and seed money of $3000 each to launch a small company</s>
<s>the most successful as voted by their fellow students will get more funding</s>
<s>it remains to be seen if this amounts to much more than a soupedup businessplan competition though mr nohria says he hopes some real businesses will be created</s>
<s>if only hbs had thought of this when bill gates was thinking of starting microsoft or mark zuckerberg was creating facebook—perhaps the school would have received shares in those firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is unclear how much the oneweek working assignments will achieve</s>
<s>pankaj ghemawat a management guru says “the literature suggests that an immersion experience needs to be at least 23 weeks and be backed up with time in the classroom” the hbs students classroom preparation will have to be pretty thorough then to make up for the brevity of their field trips</s>
<s>moreover some of the hbs alumni who have agreed to offer work experience at their firms say they are unsure what meaningful work they can offer the students</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>privately some faculty members are sceptical that all this change will be worthwhile</s>
<s>in january the vote in favour of trying the field method was “as enthusiastic as you could get from a faculty” says mr nohria wryly</s>
<s>he wisely ensured that ownership of the idea was widely spread by delegating design of the new curriculum to several faculty committees</s>
<s>the vote gave the goahead to run a “delicate experiment for 35 years to see if we can move the needle” he says compared with the 13 years it took to develop the case method into more or less what it is today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the experiment does not come cheap adding 1015 to the courses cost students pay at least $84000 a year which hbs will bear while it figures out what works</s>
<s>a lot is at stake</s>
<s>for where harvard leads other universities may follow</s>
