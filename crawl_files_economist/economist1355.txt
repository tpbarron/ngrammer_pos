<s>“more capital better capital” has been the chant of central bankers and regulators as they strive to rebuild the banking system on more solid foundations</s>
<s>the debate about how much capital banks should hold against unexpected losses has captured much attention</s>
<s>but a lawsuit in germany raises equally pressing questions about the sorts of capital banks hold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the thinking behind the regulatory push for simplicity and solidity is that over the past few decades banks have been allowed to build complex capital structures made from inferior materials</s>
<s>the best sort of capital to ensure a stable banking system is equity because it directly absorbs losses and can thus cushion against systemic shocks</s>
<s>it is however expensive so banks have sought to dilute it with cheap fillers such as the delightfullynamed “hybrid capital” and other fancy instruments</s>
<s>one reason for their popularity with the banks that issued them was that they paid fixed interest which was taxdeductible</s>
<s>regulators for their part took comfort from the fact that hybrids were a bit like equity in that payments could be stopped to preserve capital should a bank run into trouble</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sadly hybrids have not behaved quite as expected</s>
<s>where banks have been compelled to halt interest payments as a condition of receiving state bailouts which is the case across the european union they have sometimes been unable to do so</s>
<s>for instance kbc a belgian bank insisted that payments on its hybrid securities were “mandatory”</s>
<s>in contrast royal bank of scotland rescued by the british taxpayer was able to suspend interest payments on only some of its hybrids</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in germany the confused status of hybrid instruments is epitomised by a peculiar set of notes issued by banks known as “profitparticipation certificates”</s>
<s>these pay a fixed rate of interest but only if the bank is profitable</s>
<s>the trouble is german banks do not quite seem to know the precise rules that govern these payments</s>
<s>last year commerzbank paid interest on notes issued by eurohypo its propertylending subsidiary even though it suffered losses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>commerzbank suspended the payments this year following a stern talkingto by germanys bank regulator and its bank bailout fund</s>
<s>in principle this response is hard to fault but irate holders of the notes point to quirks in german law that they say compel commerzbank to pay up</s>
<s>they have filed a lawsuit to that effect</s>
<s>similar grumbles are also heard from annoyed debtholders in america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the picture is further complicated by germanys takeover laws which give minority shareholders the right to earn a fixed dividend on their shares even if the company makes a loss</s>
<s>this has led to a bizarre situation in which minority shareholders in eurohypo are receiving dividends from commerzbank even though they should normally expect to be first in line to share in the firms losses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whatever the outcome in court the case suggests that many of the securities introduced to banks capital structures need to be looked at again</s>
<s>far from being an innovation that satisfies banks investors and regulators hybrid instruments may represent the worst of all worlds</s>
