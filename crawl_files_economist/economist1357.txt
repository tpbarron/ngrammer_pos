<s>the challenge was always going to be getting the politics right</s>
<s>but when britain’s bae systems europe’s biggest defence firm and eads the francogerman maker of airbus civil jets and the owner of some smaller defence businesses announced their intention to merge a month ago managers of both firms were optimistic</s>
<s>they gushed about the encouragement they had been given by the french german and british governments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their optimism was misplaced</s>
<s>the deal died on october 10th the date set by london’s takeover panel for the two companies to declare their intentions</s>
<s>it had hit an immovable object in the shape of germany’s chancellor angela merkel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that came as a complete surprise to eads and its german boss tom enders</s>
<s>few people have more experience or better “fingertips”—his expression—for understanding the politics of europe’s defence and aerospace industry</s>
<s>a former paratrooper mr enders has moved seamlessly between academia politics and business</s>
<s>he thought he could use those fingertips to find a way of getting the politics out of eads and turning it into a “normal” business</s>
<s>no such luck</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>four years ago mr enders helped set out a longterm strategy for eads to build up the defence side of the business which had become overshadowed by airbus to outsource more of its operations to make a bigger splash in america and to reduce the stakes held by the meddlesome french and german governments</s>
<s>merging with bae would have helped eads do all of the above the british firm clocks up nearly 45 of its sales in america selling such things as armoured vehicles to the pentagon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from bae’s point of view too a merger made sense</s>
<s>with the winding down of the wars in iraq and afghanistan it faces a future of shrinking defence budgets</s>
<s>marrying eads would have given it a way back into civil aviation and a titanium balancesheet thanks to airbus’s €486 billion $626 billion order book</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the managers of the two companies knew each other and got on well</s>
<s>they rapidly agreed on a 6040 split of shareholding in eads’s favour</s>
<s>they also knew however that unless the three governments played ball the game would quickly be over</s>
<s>for the deal to make sense the french and the germans had to be willing to surrender enough influence to convince the pentagon and congress that the special security agreement given to bae’s american subsidiary would not be jeopardised</s>
<s>the french were expected to cause trouble but with some quibbling they and the british were keen for the deal to go ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however in the past few days it became clear that the opposition was coming from the germans</s>
<s>according to someone close to the discussions they initially assumed they could hide behind the french</s>
<s>when the french looked like supporting the deal the german negotiators were taken aback</s>
<s>they first insisted on the german government having the same 9 direct stake as the french had agreed to</s>
<s>no problem said the french and the british</s>
<s>the next demand was for the corporate headquarters to be in munich rather than toulouse the defence business was to have been based in london</s>
<s>“we can work something out” came the reply</s>
<s>yet on october 9th mrs merkel rang the french president françois hollande to tell him that she intended to veto the deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>where does that leave the two firms</s>
<s>the blow for eads is not quite as great as it is for bae—its main airbus business is still growing strongly</s>
<s>but mr enders’s strategy is now doomed</s>
<s>he has been reminded how hard it is to build a more rational european defence industry</s>
<s>the experience will have seared him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nowhere to go</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bae’s position is trickier</s>
<s>it is a wellmanaged firm with good longterm prospects thanks to its uniquely international portfolio</s>
<s>but the medium term looks bleak with falling sales in its core markets</s>
<s>its scope to diversify or make acquisitions is limited by a weak balancesheet and a £5 billion $8 billion pension deficit</s>
<s>guy anderson of ihs jane’s a defenceresearch firm says it is most likely that it will continue to sell noncore assets</s>
<s>however because bae is now regarded by some as a company in play mr anderson says it may need to do something bigger</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a large american defence contractor could bid for bae</s>
<s>however the british government might use its special share to prevent a deal that would leave it with far less influence than the tieup with eads would have done</s>
<s>none of the choices open to bae looks as good as the one that has just vanished in a puff of smoke</s>
