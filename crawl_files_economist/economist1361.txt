<s>maybe it wasnt such a bad week for european integration after all</s>
<s>just as voters in france and the netherlands were rejecting the european unions constitution serious talks about continental europes first significant crossborder bank merger were getting under way</s>
<s>about time too you might say some 13 years after the supposed creation of the single european market in 1992</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>italys largest bank unicredit and germanys secondlargest hvb group confirmed on may 30th that they were in talks about a “potential business combination”</s>
<s>eager europhiles may have to wait a while for a deal because negotiations could drag on and may yet lead nowhere</s>
<s>although bank austria the subsidiary through which hvb operates in central europe is a jewel hvbs german business—a big mortgage corporate and retail bank—has very little sparkle</s>
<s>granted it does have 15 of the retail market in bavaria germanys southernmost state and a slice of the northern german market</s>
<s>but it does not make much money</s>
<s>only four months ago hvb reported yet more provisions on its troubled property portfolio</s>
<s>it insisted that they would be the last but its credibility on this issue has worn thin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>alessandro profumo unicredits chief executive has a good chance of sealing a friendly takeover</s>
<s>dieter rampl his counterpart at hvb said in april that unicredit would make a good partner</s>
<s>yet there are plenty of awkward “soft” issues to be dealt with</s>
<s>albrecht schmidt mr rampls predecessor now head of hvbs supervisory board is believed to oppose a takeover that puts the italians in charge</s>
<s>hvbs workers may try to secure a deal similar to that agreed when their own bank bought bank austria in 2000 this is now listed separately in vienna with 225 of its shares floating</s>
<s>and bavarian politicians could make trouble ahead of the german federal election expected in september</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is too soon to say whether many more crossborder deals are now in the offing</s>
<s>unicredit and hvb are still just talking</s>
<s>two smaller takeover attempts in italy seem to be slipping away from the foreign bidders spains banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria and the netherlandsabn amro</s>
<s>and a study by at kearney a consulting firm suggests that domestic mergers are the only ones worth doing</s>
<s>its analysis of last years takeover of abbey a british bank by spains santander central hispano sch concludes that it “does not create value”</s>
<s>the least bad crossborder deals the firms analysis suggests would involve the french putting bnp paribas or société générale with deutsche bank germanys largest bank or crédit agricole with switzerlands ubs</s>
<s>but these would still destroy value</s>
<s>an allbritish affair involving barclays and lloyds tsb though it would surely be forbidden on competition grounds would be a winner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite such scepticism both unicredit and hvb could gain from a deal</s>
<s>mr profumo has made a good fist of merging banks cutting costs and raising profitability in italy but further consolidation at home is difficult</s>
<s>his banks “new europe” division which continues to expand contributes just under 20 to the groups net profit see chart a share that may rise with the recent joint acquisition with koc a turkish industrial group of yapi kredi turkeys fourthbiggest bank</s>
<s>mr profumo himself is at a crossroads some surmise that if this merger is shelved a career in politics will be his next step</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for hvb even if it plugs its property hole it still lacks a coherent strategy and brand new leadership could bring new vitality</s>
<s>according to a recent study by mercer oliver wyman a consulting group and morgan stanley an investment bank crossborder mergers can work if the buyer brings more sophisticated informationtechnology and risk management to the target</s>
<s>that has happened to some extent at abbey since it was bought by sch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the clear pluspoint of the germanitalian deal however is that bank austria and unicredits new europe assets would make a good fit</s>
<s>both are strong in poland croatia and bulgaria together they have a quarter or more of the market in all three countries</s>
<s>bank austria is represented in 14 countries and is a market leader in two</s>
<s>unicredit is a market leader in four countries</s>
<s>it has gaps in the czech republic and hungary which bank austria can fill</s>
<s>only in poland where both unicredit and hvb have strong and successful banks is there likely to be a clash of styles hvbs bph has grown rapidly through cheap retail mortgage lending in foreign currency mostly swiss francs a business that unicredits bank pekao considers too risky</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>central european growth may be the selling point of the merger but in old western european banking it is little more than a rounding error says one consultant rather dismissively</s>
<s>for hvb central and eastern europe has been vital because it has been virtually the only source of good news it made a profit of €417m in 2004 when hvb in germany only just broke even and the group as a whole made a loss</s>
<s>hvb has €24 billion of nonperforming loans against which it has made provisions of 57</s>
<s>its property restructuring unit has a further €154 billion of troubled loans</s>
<s>it calculates that 41 of this is covered by collateral but the proportion can rise and fall with the property market</s>
<s>this uncertainty makes hvb a shot in the dark for any buyer and must be reflected in the price</s>
<s>according to rumour the price being considered is €22 a share which values the group including bank austria at €16 billion only some €4 billion above the implied market value of bank austria alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>british and american banks with market values of many times that are surely interested in buying assets in europe west and east</s>
<s>but perhaps not yet</s>
<s>citigroup jp morgan chase and bank of america the likeliest american contenders could find themselves in a pricey auction once they started buying</s>
<s>so any purchase would have to be big and the right piece of the jigsaw says an investment banker</s>
<s>the right piece says another would be deutsche bank</s>
<s>possible british buyers such as hsbc and royal bank of scotland are cagey so they will probably wait until the spoils become more certain</s>
<s>if he can convince himself and others that his bank and hvb should join forces mr profumo might just start something</s>
