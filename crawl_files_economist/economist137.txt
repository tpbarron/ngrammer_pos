<s>like most of the 30 years that preceded it 2012 will be punctuated by statistical evidence of asias growing share of the global economy and by symbols of relative western decline</s>
<s>the financial crisis of 2008 followed by the various excitements of 2011—the american debtceiling fiasco the euro zones interminable wrangling riots on the streets of western capitals—seemed to mark a tippingpoint</s>
<s>asias rise looked faster than anyone had expected</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in asia there is some understandable schadenfreude</s>
<s>after all just over a decade ago the region had to endure western lectures on the failings of asian crony capitalism</s>
<s>and the harsh remedies imposed on the errant asian economies in the late 1990s now seem medicine too drastic for america and europe</s>
<s>sober asian policy­makers however worry</s>
<s>in the short term they know that the region would be badly hit by another severe downturn in the west</s>
<s>in the longer term they wonder whether developing asian economies will get stuck in a “middleincome trap”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the shortterm concerns may seem overblown</s>
<s>by september 2011 the asian development bank adb was still expecting that in 2012 growth in asia outside japan would moderate only to an annual rate of 75</s>
<s>and for some of the bigger economies a slowdown is welcome</s>
<s>china in particular might actually stand to benefit</s>
<s>sluggish external demand would help the governments own efforts to cool the economy and to the extent it was reflected in low commodity prices ease inflationary pressures too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the dangers for asia of such a slowdown are acute</s>
<s>chinas government will not want to risk worsening inflation by unleashing another huge stimulus into the economy as it did in response to the 2008 crisis</s>
<s>and for all its efforts since then to “rebalance” the economy towards a greater reliance on domestic consumption exports to the west remain a big part of overall demand</s>
<s>for the rest of developing asia china itself is becoming an ever more important market—the biggest trading partner for india for south korea and for the ten members of the association of southeast asian nations taken as a block</s>
<s>for many countries however a large chunk of exports to china forms part of a global supplychain whose end products are western imports</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the shortterm vulnerability to the wests economic woes is a symptom of a longerterm worry a failure in many countries in asia to progress from growth fuelled by their natural bounty and cheap labour to growth driven by higher productivity</s>
<s>as wages rise manufacturers find themselves unable to compete in export markets with lowercost producers elsewhere yet they still find themselves behind the advanced economies in highervalueadded products</s>
<s>this is the middleincome trap—which saw for example south africa and brazil languish for decades in what the world bank defines as the “middleincome” range of about $1000 to $12000 gross national income per head measured in 2010 money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>asia has the past halfcenturys most spectacular examples of countries that have avoided the trap japan followed by taiwan south korea singapore and hong kong</s>
<s>but for the majority of asian countries which are still in the “middleincome” bracket evading the trap may not be so easy</s>
<s>an illuminating report produced by the adb “asia 2050 realising the asian century” divides this group into two</s>
<s>one led by china and india accounts for 77 of asias population and 51 of its gdp and is made up of “fastgrowing converging” economies</s>
<s>another with 18 of asias population and just 6 of its gdp comprises “slow or modest growth aspiring” economies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some in the second group such as sri lanka and the philippines already says the adb “exhibit the classic signs of the middleincome trap”</s>
<s>but even the “convergers” are vulnerable</s>
<s>rising wages and other costs lay chinese exporters open to lowcost competition in some industries from countries such as bangladesh and vietnam and the competition will become more acute as chinas population ages</s>
<s>in contrast indias boom has differed from chinas and the rest of east asias in its reliance on domestic demand and growth in services rather than labourintensive manufacturing</s>
<s>unfortunately for indian optimists there is as yet no precedent of a country that has broken into the ranks of advanced nations following this model</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the adbs point is not that asia is doomed to be caught in the trap</s>
<s>rather it is that straightline growth projections face big risks</s>
<s>the most obvious are of conflict in a region littered with unresolved sovereignty disputes</s>
<s>but the adb also cites “recent adverse trends in the quality of institutions and rising corruption”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the adb report posits two asian futures</s>
<s>one “the asian century” assumes the boom continues more or less uninterrupted</s>
<s>in that scenario see chart by 2050 asia will account for more than half the global economy</s>
<s>in a gloomier “middleincome trap” scenario it will make up less than a third</s>
<s>to achieve the former outcome asian governments need to make difficult reforms now</s>
