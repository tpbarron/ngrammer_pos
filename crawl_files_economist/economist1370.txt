<s>an election should be good business for a cable news channel</s>
<s>alas this is less true if like cnn you try to be unbiased</s>
<s>when mitt romney says that 47 of americans are moochers or barack obama says that entrepreneurs didn’t build their own businesses partisan viewers crave a partisan response</s>
<s>either the candidate hates america or he is being quoted out of context</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fox news assures conservative viewers that democrats’ gaffes fall in the former category and republicans’ in the latter</s>
<s>msnbc vice versa</s>
<s>cnn tries to be fair</s>
<s>viewers hate that</s>
<s>its ratings in america are sliding while fox and msnbc are doing well see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the year to midseptember an average of 577000 people have watched cnn during primetime 25 fewer than tuned into msnbc and 69 fewer than fox attracted</s>
<s>ratings affect cnn’s two revenue streams sales of adverts and the fees that cable operators pay them to carry the channel</s>
<s>cnn which is owned by time warner has a thriving international division</s>
<s>yet america accounts for 80 of its revenues so a slump at home hurts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in july jim walton cnn’s boss announced he would leave the company by the end of the year</s>
<s>the search is now on for a new boss</s>
<s>jeff bewkes the head of time warner has scolded cnn for its performance</s>
<s>but he says he wants it to revive without sacrificing its nonpartisan brand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cnn is good at reporting hard news because it has lots of good reporters</s>
<s>it has 45 bureaus around the world—more than fox news and msnbc combined—and about 4000 employees</s>
<s>its ratings soar whenever there is a terrorist attack flood or war</s>
<s>when american embassies were recently stormed in libya yemen and egypt for example cnn got a lift</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the news is about words rather than action however cnn struggles</s>
<s>conservative viewers like to hear fox’s bill o’reilly fume about “farleft loons”</s>
<s>liberals like to hear msnbc’s rachel maddow condescend to conservatives</s>
<s>gasbags in a studio are cheaper than camera crews in the middle east which may be why cnn’s profit margins around 37 are less than msnbc’s 46 and fox’s 55</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still cnn’s margins are nothing to scoff at says derek baine of snl kagan a research firm</s>
<s>they are far better than broadcast networks’ which are around 10</s>
<s>cnn made an estimated profit of $600m this year and possibly even more</s>
<s>it continues to be a haven for advertisers that do not want to associate themselves with a political agenda</s>
<s>its audience is younger and more racially diverse than fox’s which is 95 white</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cnn’s challenge is to attract more viewers when no one is shooting anyone or blowing anything up</s>
<s>mark whitaker executive vicepresident of cnn worldwide says cnn needs to offer more “destination programming” where the journalist goes somewhere more interesting than a studio and fewer talking heads</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cnn is starting to carry more political documentaries made by hbo a sister cable network</s>
<s>it has also announced a few new shows including one hosted by anthony bourdain a globetrotting warthogrectumeating chef</s>
<s>but the firm must be careful not to tarnish its reputation for serious news by becoming too much like the discovery channel or the food network</s>
<s>it is a difficult balancing act</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the next boss chooses to differentiate cnn further from its rivals by commissioning more global reporting and less hot air it will cost a packet</s>
<s>but mr whitaker is bullish “if it got our ratings up substantially it would be worth it” he says</s>
