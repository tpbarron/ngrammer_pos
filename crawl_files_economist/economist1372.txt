<s>cannes was quiet this week</s>
<s>although the stars and the paparazzi went through the usual redcarpet routine there was less extravagance and a smaller contingent of filmbuyers than usual</s>
<s>yet for makers of independent films that was not the end of the world</s>
<s>in their business the action increasingly takes place not on the french riviera but in american living rooms</s>
<s>tricky intelligent films are finding a home in the least glamorous corner of the television business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>getting independent films into cinemas never easy has become much harder in the past year</s>
<s>some specialist distributors such as warner independent pictures have closed and others are buying fewer films</s>
<s>the credit crunch and the strong dollar have cut foreign sales</s>
<s>meanwhile cheap digitalvideo cameras and editing software have produced a flood of content</s>
<s>some 5500 films are chasing buyers in cannes this year</s>
<s>last year just 606 new films were released in american cinemas</s>
<s>many lost money</s>
<s>“the economics just do not make sense” says jonathan sehring of ifc films an independent distributor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hence the rapid growth of an alternative</s>
<s>this year ifc will release about 100 films “on demand” meaning they can be called up for a fee in most households that get their television via cable or satellite</s>
<s>many will be available on the same day that they first appear at film festivals such as sundance and south by southwest</s>
<s>later this year ifc plans to launch a new ondemand channel to showcase documentary films</s>
<s>cinetic a powerful independentfilm broker will also get into the game this summer</s>
<s>most radical of all is magnolia a distributor which has inverted the traditional release schedule for many films</s>
<s>next month it will release “the answer man” a comedy starring jeff daniels on cable</s>
<s>the film will only appear in cinemas four weeks later</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reason for the rush is that for lowbudget films the economics of video on demand do make sense</s>
<s>cable companies which take a cut when they sell a film help with advertising</s>
<s>mr sehring says ifc makes about as much when a film is sold on demand as when a punter buys a cinema ticket even though the ticket costs almost twice as much</s>
<s>he reckons he recoups his costs and returns money to filmmakers more than half the time—not bad for films that might otherwise have disappeared without trace</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it also makes sense to concentrate on a single marketing push</s>
<s>heavy advertising helps keep blockbusters in peoples minds</s>
<s>but small independent films are easily forgotten</s>
<s>joe swanberg a rising star of the “mumblecore” genre socalled because the actors talk like ordinary people says it can be frustrating to show a film at a festival and then try to recreate the buzz when it appears in cinemas months later</s>
<s>eventually he asked himself “why are we trying to do this twice”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by launching their creations on cable filmmakers must give up the dream of creating a hugely profitable surprise hit like “napoleon dynamite”</s>
<s>reviewers tend to ignore videoondemand releases</s>
<s>it was a big deal when the new york times opined on mr swanbergs most recent film which appeared on cable the same day it screened at south by southwest</s>
<s>famous actors and directors distrust a platform that carries only slightly less stigma than a straighttovideo release</s>
<s>cinemas do not want to touch any film that has appeared on television</s>
<s>ifc and magnolia get around this by having their own cinemas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>distributors are learning what kinds of films are best suited to video on demand</s>
<s>eamonn bowles magnolias president says it helps greatly if films are susceptible to brief synopsis</s>
<s>that means wellknown names and obedience to genre conventions</s>
<s>other clear winners are films that have titles starting with the letter “a” which turn up first on videoondemand menus</s>
<s>documentaries may be better suited to the internet since it caters so well to specialinterest groups</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whether accessed via cable television or the internet video on demand is likely to grow</s>
<s>americas suburbs are becoming much more diverse places with more ethnic minorities more people with degrees and more gays according to gary gates a demographer at the university of california los angeles</s>
<s>the potential audience for independent films is thus dispersing beyond the places where independent cinemas are concentrated</s>
<s>not everybody lives near an arthouse cinema but almost everybody has a remote control</s>
