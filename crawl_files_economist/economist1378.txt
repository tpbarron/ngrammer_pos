<s>not long ago netflix was a stockmarket darling</s>
<s>the californiabased firm transformed the videorental market by renting out dvds through the post and by streaming films and television shows over the internet</s>
<s>on october 23rd though it announced an 88 fall in thirdquarter profits and its market capitalisation $15 billion in july 2011 shrivelled to $33 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>netflix has been a victim of its own success</s>
<s>for about $8 a month the company woos subscribers with programmes and films that normally require a pricey paytv subscription</s>
<s>consumers love it the average netflix subscriber watches more than five tv shows and nearly three and a half films per week according to a report from gfk media a marketresearch firm</s>
<s>but this threatens the producers of the programmes that netflix rents out</s>
<s>broadcast and cable networks earn a great deal more from licensing deals with paytv companies than they do with outfits such as netflix—some $41 billion in 2012 with the former against $35 billion with the latter</s>
<s>so any sign that netflix is hurting a broadcast or cable network’s bottom line quickly leads to higher licensing fees or curbed content sales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as if that were not enough deeppocketed copycats are chipping away at netflix’s market share</s>
<s>amazon is increasing its streamingcontent library most recently with a pact with epix a film channel</s>
<s>networks and paytv companies are trying to create their own “tv everywhere” services online</s>
<s>pc and tabletfriendly offerings such as hbo go and sky’s now tv are providing more videoondemand options including content that netflix lacks or increasingly cannot afford</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it and other streaming services are responding by making original programming themselves</s>
<s>the company is working with directors such as david fincher who made “the social network” and underwriting new episodes of “arrested development” a show with a cult following</s>
<s>but producing new programmes is riskier than licensing existing ones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>netflix’s deals were made on the assumption that the company would keep growing</s>
<s>it hasn’t</s>
<s>american subscriptions have slowed and its international push has been wobbly</s>
<s>“they’re really going to have to pull a rabbit out of their hat” says brahm eiley at convergence consulting group</s>
