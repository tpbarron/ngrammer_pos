<s>back in 1984 the economist conducted an unusual survey for its christmas issue</s>
<s>we invited four former finance ministers four chairmen of big multinational companies four oxford university students and four london dustmen to offer their predictions on the economy over the next ten years</s>
<s>a decade later we checked the accuracy of their forecasts and marked their performance</s>
<s>the dustmen scored joint top along with the company bosses</s>
<s>on the price of oil the binmen demonstrated more foresight than any other group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>strangely since then the worlds banks and news organisations have not rushed to rummage through dustmens economic forecasts</s>
<s>until now</s>
<s>in october the world in 2012 put three questions on the year ahead to five london dustmen our careful sample took in mile end chelsea and earls court</s>
<s>and we put the same questions to businesspeople around the world through the economistft global business barometer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dustmen and the global executives have similar views on global growth 58 of businesspeople and 80 of binmen expect it to be between 25 and 5</s>
<s>one in three executives and one in five dustmen think it will be a recessionflirting 025 </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the prospects of the world economy will depend in part on the price of oil</s>
<s>roughly twothirds of both groups reckon it will be somewhere between $90 and $120 a barrel</s>
<s>but about a third of the executives think it will be cheaper at $6090</s>
<s>and 40 of the dustmen predict it will be $120plus remember they have a particularly distinguished forecasting record when it comes to oil</s>

<p>
<s>finally as americas presidentialelection campaign heats up we wanted to know whether barack obama could feel safe in his job</s>
<s>more than half of the executives expect mr obama to win a second term whereas four out of five dustmen think he will be booted out of the white house</s>
<s>of course that may turn out to be garbage</s>
