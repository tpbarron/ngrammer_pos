<s>“will 2011 be a year of political change in the middle east” the world in 2011 asked in november a year ago presciently</s>
<s>unfortunately for this publication that was the title of a debate at an economist conference on the year ahead held in abu dhabi</s>
<s>readers will have searched the world in 2011 in vain for an inkling of the coming arab spring</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>readers of the world in 2010 by contrast were given an alert valid eventually not just for the arab world but also for places like madrid athens and london on the likelihood of social unrest</s>
<s>it would be “a year for anger management” it said</s>
<s>shame it was the wrong year</s>
<s>in the predictions game timing matters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so does the reasoning</s>
<s>last years edition did suggest that egypts president hosni mubarak might step down—but not that he would be pushed</s>
<s>and it said that the then boss of the imf dominique strausskahn would “command headlines” but it was quite wrong about the reasons</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some events of course are simply unpredictable</s>
<s>in 2011 the unexpected happened in sad ways</s>
<s>the earthquake and tsunami in japan with its nuclear aftermath was one big example</s>
<s>another was the massacre on norways utøya island</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how did we perform last year in the breadandbutter of politics business and the economy</s>
<s>no sooner had the world in 2011 gone to press than one of the events it said might “just possibly” happen actually did the worlds most famous political prisoner aung san suu kyi was freed from house arrest</s>
<s>south sudan gained its independence as forecast</s>
<s>our correspondents judged the mood of politics in britain “a string of foreseeable crises” for the governing coalition and america “a year of angry gridlock” about right</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a number of business predictions—the return of the paywall in media linked­ins ipo a growing interest in emerging markets beyond the brics—held up</s>
<s>on the economy our record was mixed</s>
<s>we captured the overall picture accurately enough another tough year with growth in the developing world outpacing that in the rich world by a factor of four</s>
<s>we highlighted the danger of policy mistakes especially the impact of overzealous austerity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but we misjudged important details</s>
<s>on america we managed to be both right and wrong the belowconsensus forecast from the economist intelligence unit which expected gdp growth of 15 in 2011 turned out to be correct unlike the aboveconsensus prediction from the economists economics writer whose rosetinted crystal ball conjured up 3plus</s>
<s>on europe we underestimated the depth of greeces recession and how far the eurozone crisis would spread</s>
<s>in asia we thought indias growth rate might just overtake chinas it didnt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what does all this mean for interpreting the current crop of predictions</s>
<s>remember they are merely best guesses about the future</s>
<s>and more than ever expect the unexpected</s>
