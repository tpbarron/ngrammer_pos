<s>inching through the crowded streets of bangladeshs capital brings both exhilaration and frustration</s>

<s>if only the bitter politicians could prove so deft</s>
<s>some 18 months before a general election bangladesh suffers street protests</s>
<s>opposition leaders are sent to jail and disappearances and murders are widely blamed on an old rivalry for power</s>
<s>a confrontation over the next poll—who should oversee it and whether it will be fair—is already so strident that some observers doubt a contested one will be held at all</s>
<s>meanwhile bangladeshis fret over prices of food and fuel chronic power cuts and broken promises of new roads</s>

<s>as the leader of the bangladesh nationalist party bnp khaleda zia tells it all ills lie at the governments door</s>
<s>she ticks off a list of wicked acts she blames on her antagonist in an ancient rivalry the prime minister sheikh hasina</s>
<s>a young bnp politician abducted a month ago and very probably murdered</s>
<s>two others killed earlier</s>
<s>some 33 opposition figures including senior mps dumped in jail this month over a trumpedup case of arson</s>
<s>in all she says 3000 bnp members have been arrested</s>
<s>“it is to intimidate to create a sense of fear”</s>

<s>there is plenty more darkness about</s>
<s>in recent months bangladesh has endured a spate of other mysterious killings—a saudi diplomat shot dead a tradeunion activist tortured and murdered a pair of journalists butchered after investigating corruption</s>
<s>this correspondent was trailed in dhaka by a pair of secretservice men on a motorbike</s>
<s>a rumour of a bizarre coup attempt in january was used by the government to get closer political control over the army</s>

<s>one of the countrys best known figures muhammad yunus of grameen bank has been harassed for some time</s>
<s>an increasingly paranoid mrs hasina sees him as a political threat</s>
<s>this month in dhaka hillary clinton americas secretary of state met the nobel laureate and assured him of her support</s>
<s>it brought no relief</s>
<s>ministers snipe at him and the government has just ordered yet another official review of his bank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“we are very worried that the commission has been formed and terms of reference include ownership” says mr yunus</s>
<s>in effect the government is seeking ways to grab grameen which is 97owned by its poor members many of them women</s>
<s>officials are also bent on settling scores with mr yunus who oversees an ungainly charitable empire that includes a telecoms company as well as the bank</s>
<s>over a lavish dinner a group of government spies brags of having a thick file of allegations ready against the “moneymonger”</s>

<s>the list of gripes against the government is long</s>
<s>corruption is pervasive enough for donors to be alarmed</s>

<s>most telling would be a shift in indias attitude</s>
<s>long a close ally of sheikh hasinas awami league—cheering her crackdown on islamic extremists and insurgents from indias northeast and being open to more trade—indias ruling congress party may now sensibly be hedging its bets</s>
<s>pranab mukherjee indias finance minister called on mrs zia recently inviting her back to delhi</s>
<s>mrs zia chuckles that she will go after delhis summer heat is past</s>
<s>she also calls the neighbour a “friend” a possible hint of change in a party that often seeks popularity by bashing india</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as sheikh hasina looks ever more strident people may start tiptoeing away from her</s>
<s>not every ill in bangladesh can be laid at the prime ministers door</s>
<s>although she did mess with the constitution scrapping arrangements she had previously insisted on in opposition for a neutral caretaker to run the government for three months before election day she now appears to want to keep her options open possibly in order to be better able to skew the outcome of the next election</s>
<s>meanwhile mrs zias party orders street protests and hunger strikes and threatens angry mass rallies in june</s>
<s>the sad result is that politics grows more polarised and confrontational</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still mrs hasina is not quite the allpowerful bogeywoman her bitterest opponents suggest</s>
<s>certainly she seems set on cracking down on civil groups for example with a new bill to put nongovernment organisations more firmly under political control</s>
<s>but it is hard to see how the murders and attacks on activists and journalists help her government other than to spread a general sense of intimidation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the opposition too has a reputation for thuggery corruption and intimidation and does not bother much to hide it</s>

<s>its clothing industry has the potential to generate over $40 billion a year from exports according to mckinsey a consultancy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indicators of wellbeing have been improving</s>
<s>if annual economic growth of over 6 is sustained a country that not long ago was a byword for poverty can contemplate reaching middleincome levels in barely a decade</s>
<s>but that needs singleminded focus by the government on dealing with the countrys economic bottlenecks and social needs</s>
<s>instead like dhakas wretched roads politics looks jammed</s>
<s>uncertainty leading up to the next election and growing anxiety among diplomats and foreign observers of bangladesh suggest a hard tense time ahead</s>
<s>more than anyone blame the driver</s>
