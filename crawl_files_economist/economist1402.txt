<s>britains politicians lament its loss of industrial prowess and cringe at its gift for banking</s>
<s>one kind of enterprise that cheers them is the creative sector which has grown twice as fast as the rest of the economy over the past decade</s>
<s>fashion entertainment advertising and digital technology are all strengths</s>
<s>britain was well represented at this years south by southwest a music and film festival in texas—where on march 11th it was announced that jimmy wales the founder of wikipedia would join the government as an adviser</s>
<s>george osborne the chancellor of the exchequer and a culture vulture has taken an interest in the sector since his days in opposition</s>

<s>the creative industries are less popular with investors</s>
<s>banks and venture capitalists tend to regard the sector as riskier—and less motivated by profit—than more humdrum parts of the economy</s>
<s>“the mindset of a creative entrepreneur and your average investor are poles apart” says andy heath of beggars group an independent record label</s>
<s>a report for the government by stuart fraser of warwick business school found that creative firms are likelier than other businesses to be discouraged from even applying for finance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>something of a fightback against the doubting moneymen has begun</s>
<s>the sector is increasingly quick to challenge assumptions about its riskiness</s>
<s>figures unearthed for the demos thinktank last year by helen burrows a former adviser to ed vaizey the culture minister showed that the survival rate for creative startups is slightly higher than for other young businesses</s>
<s>survival is not the same as success of course</s>
<s>but the numbers suggest that creative entrepreneurs are hardheaded about cutting costs during tough times</s>

<s>the government is trying to help</s>
<s>on april 6th the seed enterprise investment scheme seis will come into effect</s>
<s>this allows an investor to put up to £100000 $157000 into a small business and claim 50 tax relief</s>
<s>although it is open to almost all firms the policy was designed for those which find it hard to raise external finance because investors see them as risky</s>
<s>the music and film sectors are especially excited</s>
<s>but the government expects that technology including the cluster of internet firms around the old street roundabout in london pictured will be the main winner</s>
<s>ascend a new seed investment fund specialising in creative businesses will launch on the same day</s>

<s>the treasury usually counsels against fiddly marketdistorting schemes</s>
<s>civil servants like to say that their ideal budget speech would last ten minutes</s>
<s>some suspect that mr osbornes announcement in november had a chilling effect on seed investment in the first quarter of this year as financiers sat on cash until april</s>
<s>but even nigel lawson the chancellor most taken with the treasurys doctrine of simplicity introduced a “business expansion scheme” in 1983 which seis resembles</s>
<s>and the hunger for growth means mr osborne has to be seen to be doing something beyond macroeconomic strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it may be that underlying trends will alleviate the problem</s>
<s>previously safe investments such as equities and sovereign debt are looking risky</s>
<s>some investors confess that there is social cachet in being able to tell people that they are involved in fun sectors such as music</s>
<s>and technology has driven down entrance costs and thus financing needs in much of the creative sector</s>
<s>if the seis only amounts to a nudge that may be all that is required</s>
