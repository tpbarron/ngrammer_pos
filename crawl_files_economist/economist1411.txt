<s>though a chill wind gusts through the garden of his hilltop home above islamabad imran khan an alltime cricketing great turned politician is all fired up</s>
<s>when his tiny party pakistan tehreekeinsaf pti boycotted the 2008 general election the gesture did not affect the outcome</s>
<s>now pakistan is preparing for another election cycle</s>
<s>a partly new senate has just been selected by regional representatives and a general election is due within a year</s>
<s>not only will mr khan take part</s>
<s>he also predicts outright victory “god willing we will sweep the election”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the former captain of pakistans national team is untroubled by selfdoubt</s>
<s>critics dub him messianic—as do devotees</s>
<s>he refers to his giant political rallies in lahore and karachi late last year as “electric” “inspiring” and “phenomenal”</s>
<s>he brushes aside suggestions that crowds were bused in or that he benefited from help from pakistans powerful spy agency the interservices intelligence isi</s>
<s>instead ordinary folk came and donated funds to his party something unheard of in pakistan</s>
<s>karachi saw such “fervour” even that “we ended up making a profit”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he is right to be excited</s>
<s>for 16 years though well liked personally mr khan attracted support chiefly from an insignificant bunch of educated youngsters</s>
<s>recently he has had a string of successes big rallies defections from other parties by leading politicians and encouraging polls</s>
<s>his partys rise coincides with a slump for the ruling pakistan peoples party which pollsters now say barely commands 10 support and the collapse of a rival in punjab the pakistan muslim league quaidiazam</s>
<s>to mr khan the reasons are obvious</s>
<s>voters despise “criminal” politicians who pay no taxes and pursue detested policies</s>
<s>and since all other parties hold office somewhere nationally or at provincial level “we are the only opposition” he believes the fervour will translate into votes that send those crooked leaders packing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it all looks too rosy however</s>
<s>though polls put support for mr khans pti at just below 20 nationally double its tally a year ago that may be hard to sustain</s>
<s>in any case it is hardly enough to sweep to victory</s>
<s>to rule he would need coalition partners among them hardline islamist conservatives who share his antiamericanism and agree with him that the way osama bin laden was killed last year was pakistans “greatest humiliation”</s>
<s>doubts persist about other potential allies</s>
<s>mr khans welcome of veteran politicians including two former foreign ministers criticised as lotas turncoats has rubbed some shine from his movement</s>
<s>as he comes under keener scrutiny from political chatshow hosts and newspaper columnists his own image may suffer too</s>
<s>he has to fend off suggestions that he is secretly backed by the armys top brass as well as its spies</s>
<s>he argues that since he wants to cut military ties with america from which the pakistani army has received billions of dollars he is “unshackled” to the establishment</s>
<s>yet it is striking that the men in khaki do not oppose him</s>
<s>indeed they cheer him on relishing the headaches he gives other politicians</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the party under most pressure is punjabs dominant force the pakistan muslim league nawaz run by a former prime minister nawaz sharif</s>
<s>until not long ago it looked favourite to win a national election</s>
<s>shahbaz sharif nawazs younger brother and punjabs chief minister has admitted gloomily that mr khan has indeed become “a political figure to reckon with”</s>
<s>the sharifs main hope is that despite mr khans personal charms the pti lacks the experience to turn popularity into votes and seats</s>
<s>the strength of the established parties by contrast lies in having tough local guys in each constituency pockets bulging with cash who deliver blocks of voters on election day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what if the amiable mr khan got into office</s>
<s>his priority is wiping out corruption “in 90 days” by setting a good example and keeping his cabinet and party clean</s>
<s>that is a popular thing to say but it sounds naive given the deeprooted venality in pakistani politics not to mention the civil service courts and army</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and some of his values are less attractive</s>
<s>mr khan plays up his religiosity he breaks off speeches to pray</s>
<s>on march 14th he cancelled a trip to a conference in india because salman rushdie an author who has fallen foul of muslim fundamentalists would be there</s>
<s>of pakistans wretched blasphemy law which has been used to persecute religious minorities he says it is “abused” but he declines to call it wrong in itself</s>
<s>mr khan denies attacking pakistans increasingly beleaguered liberals though on television recently he appeared to attack “liberal scum”</s>
<s>he is furious he says only with those who support the american policy of drone attacks carried out in pakistan against perceived terrorists</s>
<s>“i call myself a liberal</s>
<s>how can i call myself scum” his foreign views are not particularly encouraging</s>
<s>he wants india to sort out kashmir ie hand over contested territory before pakistan should consider any tradeopening deal with its giant neighbour</s>
<s>this is a way of saying nothing will change</s>
<s>yet with the taliban in both afghanistan and pakistan he seeks engagement and unilateral ceasefires</s>
<s>he says he has been vindicated in afghanistan as america belatedly tries talking to the taliban though he fears president barack obama will “mess things up”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its a jumble out there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though he is a cricketing celebrity has a widely read autobiography and has been in politics for almost two decades mr khan remains a puzzle</s>
<s>much of his appeal to young urban religious conservatives is as a radical eager to do away with the rottenness in pakistans politics</s>
<s>yet his weak party lack of organisation and an inevitable need to compromise cast doubt on his ability to overturn the old order</s>
<s>the view from his garden of mountains and a lake is magnificent</s>
<s>but head down to the bottom of mr khans hill and you find a jumble of halfbuilt houses and shops and twisting lanes</s>
<s>the daily mess of life in pakistan may yet prove too much for even the loftiest of leaders</s>
