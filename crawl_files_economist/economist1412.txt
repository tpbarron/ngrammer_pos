<s>french voters will go to the polls for a presidential election that will defy the script drafted only a year ago</s>
<s>dominique strausskahn the onetime poll favourite will not run</s>
<s>instead the socialists will campaign with a highly inexperienced candidate françois hollande for a highly uncertain vote</s>
<s>history has raised the stakes on both sides</s>
<s>on the left the socialist party has not won a presidential election since 1988</s>
<s>on the right only one former president under the fifth republic valéry giscard destaing has failed to win a reelection bid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tworound presidential poll on april 22nd and may 6th will be followed by parliamentary elections in june the triumphant party in the first will probably also win the second</s>
<s>ten or so presidential candidates will stand including greens and communists</s>
<s>but the outcome will be determined by the performance of just four nicolas sarkozy the incumbent on the right mr hollande on the left françois bayrou in the centre and marine le pen of the farright national front</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unloved mr sarkozy cannot hope to charm voters and so will base his pitch on competence</s>
<s>with a successful armed campaign in libya to his name he will present himself as a man of experience to try to shake off his grating image as a selfpromoting hyperkinetic meddler</s>
<s>his message however will be quite different to that of 2007 less about liberalising france and nudging the french out of their comfort zone and more about protecting it and asserting a strong state</s>
<s>the upshot will be a more classically gaullist candidate not the thrilling reformist politician of yesterday </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this will offer voters less of a clear choice between left and right socialism will compete with “socialism lite”</s>
<s>the eurozone crisis will at least force both sides to embrace debtreduction a semirevolution in french politics</s>
<s>but neither will be bold enough to warn of deep spending cuts</s>
<s>mr sarkozy has already gone back on a pledge not to raise taxes</s>
<s>mr hollande will promise to transfer more of the tax burden to the rich his partys manifesto pledges to return to retirement at the age of 60</s>

<p>
<s>the likeliest second round will pit mr hollande against mr sarkozy</s>
<s>but a surprise cannot be ruled out</s>
<s>mr sarkozy will be squeezed in the centre by mr bayrou who emerges from nowhere to fight each presidential poll and on the far right by a revived ms le pen</s>
<s>with her steely will and disarming charm she has detoxified the jackbooted party of her father jeanmarie</s>
<s>she will call for france to leave the euro and will rail against “islamification” with an appeal to common french values such as laïcité secularism</s>
<s>this will push mr sarkozy into hard talk on immigration and keep open the possibility of a firstround shock</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the result will be extremely close</s>
<s>mr sarkozy is a formidable campaigner</s>
<s>but there is also a strong desire for change and a lingering antisarkozysme which mr hollande will exploit by branding himself a “normal” president</s>
<s>the second round will turn on a slim majority</s>
<s>on paper mr hollande ought to win</s>
<s>on best form mr sarkozy might just pull off a lastminute victory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new president however will have his hands tied by the perilous state of the public finances and a faltering economy</s>
<s>public spending in france as a share of gdp is higher than in sweden no government has balanced a budget since 1974</s>
<s>with bond markets fretful particularly about a socialist victory and french banks in trouble france could even lose its triplea credit rating</s>
<s>if the socialists do win they will not be able to afford many of their promises retirement at 60 will be junked</s>
<s>if the right is reelected mr sarkozy will raise taxes under fresh budget pressure</s>
<s>disappointment will set in fast</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at home in a year that marks the 50th anniversary of the independence of algeria as yet untouched by the arab spring there will be a complex sense of malaise in the heavily muslim banlieues or suburban council estates</s>
<s>abroad france will try to shore up its postlibya credibility</s>
<s>but there will be quarrels with germany over how to manage the eurozone crisis and shape the “economic government” cherished by france</s>
<s>a socialist victory coming after the president who returned france to natos integrated command would make ties with britain and america prickly at least at first close francobritish military cooperation could stall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the year will also mark a new political climate with voters less tolerant and the media more inquiring about their leaders moral behaviour—both in the boardroom and the bedroom see article </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>france does change but only slowly</s>
<s>with no leader vowing to alter course radically the theme in 2012 will be muddling through rather than a bold competitivenessraising reform of the welfare state and labour market that the country still sorely needs </s>
