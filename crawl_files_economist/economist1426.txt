<s>“it will be viable and will not post losses” promised luis de guindos spain’s finance minister on august 31st as he unveiled plans for a “bad bank” to take over the dud property assets of spain’s troubled lenders</s>
<s>experience suggests that such pledges are not easily kept</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>america’s resolution trust corporation rtc for instance was set up in 1989 to clean up savingsandloans institutions with $394 billion in assets</s>
<s>the process cost taxpayers almost $76 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the example of sweden’s widely admired bad bank in the 1990s is even less encouraging</s>
<s>sweden’s bank regulators vigorously marked down souring assets forced banks to recapitalise or be nationalised and moved dud loans into specialised assetmanagement companies</s>
<s>this was to allow cleanedup lenders to operate as “good banks” that lent to the real economy</s>
<s>judged by its overall impact the swedish bad bank was a success growth bounced back quite quickly</s>
<s>but the cost to taxpayers was high</s>
<s>sweden paid about 4 of its gdp to bail out its financial system yet got back only about half of that from selling off loans and stakes in banks</s>

<s>more reassuring to spanish taxpayers is maiden lane a vehicle created by the new york federal reserve to house assets owned by bear stearns and aig that have turned out to be less toxic than expected</s>
<s>in june this year maiden lane repaid in full and with interest the money it had borrowed to fund its purchases</s>
<s>it still has some assets left to sell so the government will probably turn a profit on the deal in contrast to earlier estimates that it might lose as much as $6 billion on its $29 billion in assets from bear stearns alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another relative success may be found in britain’s bad bank which took over some of the loans issued by northern rock and all of the ones held by bradford  bingley</s>
<s>by the end of june 2012 it had £90 billion $141 billion on its books on which it seems to be turning a profit thanks to cheap funding from the government</s>
<s>british taxpayers have fared rather worse with nominally good banks the government’s equity stakes in lloyds banking group and royal bank of scotland have fallen in value by over £30 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ireland’s bad bank the national asset management agency nama also seems to be doing fairly well in managing the €74 billion $93 billion in loans it took over mainly because it bought the assets from irish banks for just €32 billion</s>
<s>yet it is now in the invidious position of being a longterm manager of a large portfolio of stateowned properties with all the risks of political interference that this entails</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these precedents suggest a few lessons for spain’s bad bank</s>
<s>the first is to be conservative when valuing the assets that will go into the bad bank even if this imposes steeper losses on the banks handing them over</s>
<s>cautious valuations will help set a floor for property markets and make it easier for the bad bank to sell assets quickly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a second lesson is that borrowing costs matter</s>
<s>bad banks in britain and america turned good because they could borrow cheaply</s>
<s>unless spain’s borrowing costs fall sharply the government will be hardpressed to make a turn on even deeply discounted banking assets</s>
<s>last is the lesson from sweden and the rtc that bad banks may be judged successful even if they incur large losses</s>
<s>rather than promising profits mr de guindos might do well to start reminding people of that</s>
