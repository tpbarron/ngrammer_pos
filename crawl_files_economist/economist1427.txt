<s>mr schloss was part of a small group who worked with benjamin graham a columbia business school professor whose most famous disciple is warren buffett</s>
<s>mr schloss did not spend time tailing corporate managers</s>
<s>his research team doubled in size when his son joined</s>

<s>in part he could do so because of a famously frugal cost structure</s>
<s>in part he was protected by an extraordinary longterm record</s>

<s>in 1999 when his portfolio was composed of everything no one wanted he was asked how even if his own convictions were unshaken he could ensure that his investors stuck with him</s>
<s>being a true contrarian required just one rule he said “never tell a client what they own”</s>
