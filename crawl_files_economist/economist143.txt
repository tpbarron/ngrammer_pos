<s>they will turn up on driveways with a recharging lead snaking into the garage and will creep along silently in traffic jams</s>
<s>driving on volts rather than petrol will accelerate in 2012 as many new electric and hybrid cars arrive in showrooms</s>
<s>for the first time the sales of such vehicles will exceed 1m worldwide</s>

<s>potential customers however will face difficult buying decisions</s>
<s>for a start the cars will be pricey—even after various subsidies</s>
<s>and consumers will find it harder to calculate if this additional cost can be recovered in fuel savings</s>
<s>this is because petrol and diesel engines will become more economical</s>
<s>expect news of 100mpg 28 litres100km small city models</s>

<p>
<s>even trickier will be deciding whether you need an hev a phev or a bev</s>
<s>an hev is a hybrid electric vehicle like the toyota prius which first went on sale in japan in 1997</s>
<s>hevs use a petrol engine but also have an electric motor to boost overtaking or travel short distances without the engine running</s>
<s>the battery is topped up by recovering energy when the car slows or brakes</s>
<s>in 2012 many new cars will come with a hybrid option</s>

<p>
<s>phevs are plugin hybrids with larger batteries that can also be recharged from the mains</s>
<s>they range from a new plugin prius for 2012 which can travel for about 20km 12 miles on electric power to hybrids that are driven by electric motors but use a “rangeextender”—in effect a petrol engine running as a generator—to go longer distances</s>
<s>the chevrolet volt opelvauxhall ampera in europe and the fisker karma a luxury sports saloon have allelectric ranges of around 80km and several hundred more with the extender running</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with a bev you have only the battery to rely on</s>
<s>but without the weight of an engine these purely electric cars are lighter so they can travel farther</s>
<s>the nissan leaf renault zoe and mitsubishi imiev are among the many contenders</s>
<s>teslas new car the model s will have a bigbattery option supposed to be good for 480km on a single charge</s>

<s>john gartner research director of pike research a colorado company which monitors clean technologies predicts that of the 13m electrified vehicles he expects to be sold worldwide in 2012 80 will be hevs 11 bevs and 9 phevs</s>
<s>the bevs he says will be most popular in crowded cities in europe and asia where shorter journeys are more common</s>
<s>reallife ranges though will depend on how hard drivers use the accelerator and how much electrical equipment lights wipers heater etc is running</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet most trips are short</s>
<s>in europe half of all car journeys are under 10km and in america about 60 of vehicles are driven only up to 50km a day</s>
<s>bmw and daimlers smart have found electriccar drivers charge up mostly at home on average just three times a week</s>
<s>so “range anxiety” may well turn out to be less of a worry with cars powered only by a battery than some people imagine </s>
