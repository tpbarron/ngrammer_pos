<s>colombia is the world’s tenthlargest coal producer</s>
<s>it also supplies 55 of the world’s emeralds</s>
<s>however most of its mining potential remains untapped the industry makes up just 24 of gdp</s>
<s>for decades foreign investors were scared off by the country’s endemic violence</s>
<s>but by the mid2000s as security improved and commodity prices soared mining seemed poised for rapid growth</s>
<s>the government of Álvaro uribe encouraged this with tax breaks and investment incentives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those inducements may have worked too well</s>
<s>foreign investment in mining did rise ninefold in the decade to 2011</s>
<s>however a handful of big companies made up most of the increase while officials were swamped by licence requests from smaller firms</s>
<s>by february 2011 more than 19000 had piled up creating a massive backlog</s>

<p>
<s>juan manuel santos mr uribe’s successor responded by hitting the brakes</s>
<s>in 2011 colombia stopped accepting new applications and ended mr uribe’s most lucrative perks</s>
<s>during the hiatus the government reviewed all pending requests rejecting over 90 and revoked the licences of firms that had not paid required fees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on august 3rd a new national mining agency will begin accepting requests</s>
<s>in areas where colombia wants to promote investment it will solicit competitive bids</s>
<s>elsewhere the process will remain firstcome firstserved but with tighter controls</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next year the government will submit for congressional approval a new mining code which will ban digging in protected areas and set up bidding rules</s>
<s>it will seek to formalise the role of unlicensed smallscale miners giving them a special tax rate and try to distinguish them from the gangs that extort them and also mine gold illegally</s>
<s>the government says it will try to destroy the criminals’ mining machinery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far the new rules seem to have pleased nobody</s>
<s>unions and greens held marches across the country on august 1st demanding stricter environmental safeguards</s>
<s>uncertainty about regulations and the long licensing freeze led the fraser institute a canadian thinktank to lower colombia on its ranking of places for mining investment</s>
<s>and the recent favourable conditions may be over as guerrilla attacks mount and commodity prices soften</s>
<s>yet mauricio cárdenas the mining minister is unfazed</s>
<s>“once miners see what we’ve been doing” he says “they will see we’re moving in the right direction”</s>
