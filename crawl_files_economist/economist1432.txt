<s>for the second time an italian court has ruled against the former prime minister silvio berlusconi in a case in which he is suing the economist for libel</s>
<s>he had sued the newspaper in 2001 claiming it had libelled him in a report headlined “an italian story” published in april of that year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>seven years later a judge rejected all of mr berlusconi’s claims and ordered him to make a payment for costs to the economist</s>
<s>mr berlusconi who was by then again italy’s prime minister appealed</s>
<s>we are pleased to report that the court in milan has turned down his appeal</s>
<s>the judges again ordered the former prime minister to pay the economist’s costs</s>
<s>mr berlusconi can now take his case to italy’s highest appeals court</s>
<s>but he would have to do so on a point of law or procedure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a separate case involving mr berlusconi and the economist ended two years ago</s>
<s>he had claimed he was libelled in an open letter from our theneditor bill emmott</s>
<s>the letter challenged him to answer questions about his business and political dealings that were set out in detail in an online dossier</s>
<s>that case was thrown out by a judge in 2009 but without any award for costs</s>
<s>mr berlusconi did not appeal and in 2010 the judgment became definitive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>during the years when mr berlusconi dominated italian politics its economy grew more slowly than anywhere else in the world apart from zimbabwe and libya</s>
<s>perhaps he should have paid more attention to that</s>
