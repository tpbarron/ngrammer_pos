<s>drugs extortion kidnapping peoplesmuggling mexico’s organisedcrime multinationals have a keen eye for diversification</s>
<s>a growing sideline is stolen oil</s>
<s>in 2011 outlaws made off with 335m barrels of fuel belonging to pemex the staterun oil monopoly up from 216m in 2010</s>
<s>the thefts are reckoned to deprive the company of more than $1 billion per year</s>
<s>pemex’s profits pay for a third of the federal government’s budget</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>stealing the fuel which includes gas condensate and refined oil as well as crude is not hard</s>
<s>some goes missing from lorries that are held up in lonely stretches of desert</s>
<s>more is siphoned out of lengthy exposed pipelines</s>
<s>tapping the highpressure pipes is dangerous in 2010 a suspected attempt to puncture one produced an explosion that caused 28 deaths</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite such accidents ever more people are taking the risk</s>
<s>last year pemex detected 1324 taps over twice as many as in 2010</s>
<s>the increase was partly down to better detection the firm says</s>
<s>but robbers are getting more sophisticated sometimes pumping water back into the pipes to fool pressure sensors</s>
<s>pemex concedes that some sites have been “taken over practically by bands of organised criminals”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>compared with nigeria the world capital of oil theft mexico has much greater refining capacity</s>
<s>refined oil can be hawked on roadsides to motorists a practice that is illegal but common</s>
<s>crude oil and naturalgas condensate are harder to get rid of</s>
<s>some can be sold for industrial processes such as brickmaking</s>
<s>but the stolen product cannot be palmed off on mexican refineries because they are all run by pemex</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the solution is to smuggle it to the united states to be refined there</s>
<s>forged documents get the fuel across the border in rented tankers often disguised as a different chemical</s>
<s>once through customs it goes to unsuspecting or unscrupulous buyers</s>
<s>solvents are sent the other way to dilute refined oil that is to be sold in mexico</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pemex is using the american courts to crack down</s>
<s>in 2011 the former head of a texas oil firm was convicted of selling stolen condensate</s>
<s>another case accuses 12 oil and gas companies of dealing in pilfered fuel</s>
<s>in a court document pemex says “in a reversal of the classic western movie mexican criminals have sought refuge with their illgotten gains by crossing the rio grande to the north where the mexican government has no authority to follow” some defendants have been charged with dealing knowingly in stolen fuel</s>
<s>others such as shell and conocophillips are accused of unwittingly handling the contraband</s>
<s>both firms decline to comment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however to stamp out oil theft pemex will have to be as aggressive inside mexico as abroad</s>
<s>the company has hired more security staff invested in monitoring technology and won stiffer penalties for robbers</s>
<s>it has also recruited the army to scramble its helicopters to investigate pressure losses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but that leaves much to be done</s>
<s>over the past decade pemex has loosened its regulations on who may transport its fuels and its oversight of sales at petrol stations</s>
<s>reversing that would make it easier to spot where oil is being lost</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a tougher measure would be purging its staff</s>
<s>in the decade to 2011 over 100 pemex workers and subcontractors were tied to oil theft</s>
<s>in 2010 the army seized four tonnes of marijuana at a pemex plant</s>
<s>however the pemex workers’ union is one of mexico’s strongest</s>
<s>and with no competitors the monopoly’s managers have little reason to pick a risky political fight</s>
