<s>in 1999 forbes a business magazine described an attempt to streamline hitachi a company which has long admired america’s general electric as “jack welch lite”</s>
<s>the effort failed</s>
<s>in the next decade hitachi spent a fortune trying to restructure itself but recorded japan’s largest ever manufacturing loss in 2009</s>
<s>today it still has more than 1000 subsidiaries or affiliates and employs about 324000 staff</s>
<s>however much it tries to simplify its businesses which run from nuclearpower plants to data storage to washing machines they still boggle the mind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so hiroaki nakanishi pictured who took over as hitachi’s boss in 2010 is trying a different approach leadership</s>
<s>this is not as unusual as you might think in japan</s>
<s>this month masayoshi son led the firm he founded softbank in a $20 billion takeover of sprint its american mobilephone counterpart</s>
<s>but it is not common in a boss who has risen up the ranks of a consensusloving behemoth like hitachi</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of a topdown redesign mr nakanishi 66 has put the burden on his managers they should benchmark hitachi’s units against global firms not japanese ones and their futures will be decided on that basis</s>
<s>in the past few years hitachi has recovered from crisis to overtake local rivals such as toshiba and mitsubishi electric but taking a longer run of 25 years its returns on equity have averaged a mere 18 according to macquarie a bank</s>
<s>it trails similarsized peers such as siemens of germany see article</s>
<s>when sir george buckley exboss of 3m an american manufacturer was asked what he could offer hitachi as one of its first foreign board members he replied “3m’s profit margins are five times those of hitachi</s>
<s>there are many lessons i think”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so mr nakanishi is promoting what he sees as another personal trait boldness</s>
<s>he recounts that when he ran hitachi’s harddiskdrive unit he persuaded his superiors to invest $800m in a business that was losing $400m a year</s>
<s>normally such a big bet would have been unheard of at hitachi but it worked</s>
<s>what is more instead of keeping the business once it was profitable this year he sold it to america’s western digital for $48 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the impetus to think faster and more globally comes from the changing nature of hitachi’s markets</s>
<s>in fiscal 2012 43 of the company’s revenues came from overseas up from around 30 a decade ago though short of his 50 goal</s>
<s>this means the company’s mindset has to change too</s>
<s>emergingmarket clients demand different goods and services</s>
<s>emerging nations have highly competitive engineering firms</s>
<s>so there must be changes in hiring and talent management he says</s>
<s>to recruit and nurture the best graduates he has created a single hitachiwide employee pool and the best can move around different units</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the same reason he is keen to promote foreigners who he says have faced a “glass ceiling” at hitachi</s>
<s>he notes that its biggest unit information and telecommunications systems with 73000 employees has no foreigners in the top management team though some of the american executives within it run $4 billion businesses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under its chairman takashi kawamura hitachi now has seven external board members including three foreigners on a 13strong board</s>
<s>mr nakanishi laughs at the folly of having only “good guys” and “tomodachi” friends from japan’s business lobby keidanren on its board</s>
<s>previously he says there was rarely serious talk about the future of the global economy</s>
<s>now sir george and other nonexecs have obliged hitachi to discuss its future and that of its units in a more hardnosed fashion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr nakanishi himself has taken responsibility for hitachi’s main shortterm priority costcutting</s>
<s>he is attempting to iron out the myriad overlaps between its units in the backoffice in production costs and in materials procurement</s>
<s>he still believes hitachi can meet its goal of a 53 operatingprofit margin this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but hitachi continues to be buffeted by an economic slowdown in china japan’s island dispute with that country and uncertainty about japan’s nuclearpower business following the fukushima disaster in 2011</s>
<s>its businesses even in japan face too much competition to be secure</s>
<s>sir george borrows from a french writer antoine de saintexupéry to describe what he sees as a big challenge</s>
<s>“perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add but when there is no longer anything to take away” the quotation alone must be worth a seat on the board</s>
