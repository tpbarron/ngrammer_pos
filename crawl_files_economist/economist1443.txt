<s>this old idea gained new life in july when diw a thinktank in berlin argued that the sovereigndebt crisis in the euro zone could easily be solved if governments confiscated part of the ample private wealth that still exists in europe including germany see chart</s>
<s>as a bonus such a levy would also reduce inequality</s>

<s>the first question is who counts as rich</s>
<s>diw based its analysis on a starting point of €250000 $315000 of individual wealth</s>
<s>but that would hit the middleclass</s>
