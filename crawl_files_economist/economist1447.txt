<s>yoshihiko noda japan’s prime minister still chafes at a cover story in the economist last year called “turning japanese” which argued that the west was suffering from a japanstyle lack of leadership</s>
<s>he has sought to change that image by pushing through a controversial bill to raise the consumption tax</s>
<s>but on october 1st he gave a lesson in how petty political expediency still trumps most things</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just a week before hosting the annual imfworld bank meetings mr noda replaced his finance minister with koriki jojima pictured a 65yearold former union leader and parliamentary dealmaker who has neither ministerial nor financial experience</s>
<s>he is japan’s third finance minister in just over a year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>analysts say mr jojima’s appointment reflected little more than a “buggins’s turn” reshuffle producing the third cabinet of mr noda’s 13 months as prime minister</s>
<s>with support for his party weak ahead of an election he has promised to call soon mr noda had to offer some party stalwarts cabinet posts to maintain unity</s>
<s>mr jojima’s apparent bargaining skills may also have helped mr noda needs opposition support for a bill to issue bonds to finance this year’s budget in order to avoid japan’s own “fiscal cliff” in the coming months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reshuffle was a selfinflicted diplomatic black eye nonetheless</s>
<s>takehiko nakao a viceminister of finance said after briefing his new boss “‘explain’ is not really a good word” that there would be consistency at the upcoming multilateral meetings</s>
<s>but many will regret the departure of jun azumi the previous finance minister who led efforts this year to boost the imf’s reserves by $450 billion to help prevent the euro crisis from spreading</s>
<s>although mr azumi was another financial novice his bold leadership had boosted japan’s credibility</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with an unknown as finance minister economic policymakers arriving in tokyo will be pleased to find at least one familiar face in masaaki shirakawa who has led the bank of japan boj since 2008</s>
<s>but adding to the sense of drift at the top of the world’s thirdlargest economy it is becoming increasingly clear that politicians are unlikely to reappoint mr shirakawa when his term ends next april</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shinzo abe who was elected on september 26th as head of the opposition liberal democratic party has said he will increase pressure on the boj to become more active in ending deflation</s>
<s>so will mr noda’s democratic party of japan</s>
<s>they may not agree on who should replace mr shirakawa though</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr shirakawa argues that the boj is providing its “utmost support”</s>
<s>it has set an inflation goal of 1</s>
<s>to get there it buys not only government paper but also riskier assets such as exchangetraded funds</s>
<s>to bolster growth it provides cheap funding to banks to lend to businesses</s>
<s>he says these measures have begun to stir bank lending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but his message is ignored by politicians possibly because he also asks them to deregulate the economy anathema to their bigbusiness donors and encourage more women and older people into the workforce</s>
<s>instead of finding scapegoats and bringing in buggins that is indeed what they should be focused on</s>
