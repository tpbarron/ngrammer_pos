<s>late this year the worlds two biggest powers will each choose their leaders</s>
<s>the way america does it looks messy and inefficient</s>
<s>chinas bureaucratic method by contrast is designed to provide a smooth transition and a continuity of policy</s>
<s>it has long been signalled that this year xi jinping will inherit the communist partys leadership from hu jintao</s>
<s>but there are many other posts to be filled</s>
<s>behind closed doors it is fair to assume that politics in china are no less vicious than in the rome of julius caesar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the sacking on march 15th of bo xilai as party chief of the southwestern region of chongqing provided a rare glimpse inside those doors</s>
<s>the son of bo yibo a leader of the partys long march generation mr bo had seemed destined for the zenith of power in china—the ninemember standing committee of the partys politburo</s>
<s>his downfall represents the biggest public rift in chinas leadership for two decades</s>
<s>there are reasons to celebrate it yet the manner of his going is a sharp reminder of whats wrong with chinas political system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first reason to cheer is that some of mr bos ideas and the style of his rule in chongqing were disturbing</s>
<s>two policies made him famous</s>
<s>the first was a popular crackdown on chongqings “mafia”</s>
<s>many ordinary chinese welcomed his noholdsbarred approach to going after gangsters many of whom would have had links with corrupt officials</s>
<s>but there are credible allegations that mr bo used his campaign for his own political ends selectively attacking his opponents</s>
<s>a local businessman now in hiding abroad has said he suffered torture and extortion at the hands of mr bos henchmen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other policy was to pay homage to some aspects of maoism—favouring state enterprises for example and reviving “red songs” including some popular during the cultural revolution</s>
<s>the campaign showed breathtaking hypocrisy as well as forgiveness</s>
<s>mr bo himself suffered during the cultural revolution</s>
<s>but thereafter he resumed the privileged career path of the princeling</s>
<s>this “leftist” sends his children to elite schools in the west</s>
<s>both “red” and “antimafia” campaigns can be seen as part of a power struggle designed to discredit wang yang his predecessor in chongqing and rival for a standingcommittee seat</s>
<s>mr wang now party secretary in the southern province of guangdong has a reputation as something of a liberal</s>
<s>that he seems to have come out on top in this battle is good news</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>welcome too is the little window the affair opens into the corrupt fratricidal ways of party politics</s>
<s>mr bos downfall was precipitated by the flight to an american consulate of wang lijun his former police chief and right hand in the antimafia drive</s>
<s>mr wang is now under investigation in china</s>
<s>mr bo too may soon find himself answering awkward questions</s>
<s>that chongqings dirty linen was aired in front of american diplomats on his watch may matter more than the dirt itself</s>
<s>but his sacking will not herald a new era in which party and government officials are to account for their actions</s>
<s>crimes and misdemeanours like ideology are merely weapons in a power struggle</s>
<s>winners can still get away with it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the day before the sacking wen jiabao chinas prime minister had foreshadowed it with a rare public tickingoff for the chongqing leadership at a press conference</s>
<s>in another presumed dig at mr bo however mr wen said something rather remarkable that without political reform china might suffer another tragedy “like the cultural revolution”</s>
<s>this seems preposterous fastgrowing increasingly plural china is not on the brink of a similar outbreak of party fanned mass hysteria like the one that gripped china in the late 1960s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the party is not over</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr wen is right however to point out that the political system remains basically unaltered</s>
<s>it is still one in which the factional squabbles of a few men in beijing are fought out across the whole nation</s>
<s>it is still one in which as recently as 1989 a succession struggle was waged in blood on the streets of beijing</s>
<s>it is still one in which the communist party has only managed one smooth transfer of leadership its most recent transition in 2002</s>
<s>by comparison americas laborious process looks rather attractive</s>
