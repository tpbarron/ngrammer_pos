<s>informal lending is rampant in china</s>
<s>although some private banks like minsheng do lend to small enterprises the official banks that dominate chinese banking prefer to lend to wellconnected state firms</s>
<s>many chinese entrepreneurs have been forced to turn to shadow banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>using the black market can be hazardous</s>
<s>the countrys supreme court is for instance currently considering the deathpenalty case of wu ying a businesswoman accused of illegal fundraising</s>
<s>meanwhile a credit crunch last year that led to numerous defaults in zhejiang a coastal province known for its entrepreneurialism has brought home the financial risks</s>
<s>that crash attracted the attention of policymakers in beijing who have long tolerated shadow banking but have never liked it</s>
<s>now they have started to fiddle</s>

<p>
<s>at the end of march officials announced that wenzhou a dynamic city in zhejiang would be named a “special financial zone” in which two pilot schemes will be introduced</s>
<s>first informal moneylenders will be encouraged to register as private lending institutions free to operate with the blessing of the state</s>
<s>second private citizens in wenzhou will be allowed to invest up to $3m each directly in nonbank entities abroad without the need for a formal government intermediary</s>

<p>
<s>these moves are welcome</s>
<s>legitimising blackmarket finance could accelerate economic growth by deepening the pool of capital available to the countrys cashstarved entrepreneurs</s>
<s>michael werner of sanford c bernstein an investment bank also points out that such a reform would help by giving legal remedy in case of default</s>
<s>at the moment there is none</s>
<s>during last years crunch in wenzhou for example some bankrupt bosses simply boarded up their factories and fled town</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the move to allow direct overseas investment is also a promising step towards opening up chinas capital account</s>
<s>at the moment mainland residents can legally move only a pittance abroad in any given year</s>
<s>if the pilot scheme is expanded the opening could help ease upward pressure on property prices by offering punters another way to seek high returns</s>
<s>frederic neumann of hsbc thinks allowing money to flow abroad could ease the “financial repression” of low interest rates for savers</s>

<s>tantalisingly wen jiabao the prime minister this week declared that the “monopoly” grip of staterun banks must be broken and hinted that the reforms in zhejiang would be expanded nationally if successful</s>
<s>officials also almost tripled the amount of foreign investment allowed in chinas capital markets to $80 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nicholas lardy of the peterson institute for international economics a thinktank cautions against too much excitement</s>
<s>if the pilot expands nationally then it is worth applauding he says but it would still lack the most important reform an interestrate liberalisation that would allow banks to compete freely for custom</s>
<s>still in time the reforms in zhejiang may come to be seen as the start of something big</s>
