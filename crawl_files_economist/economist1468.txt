<s>in a compound up the road in dhahran sits saudi aramco the world’s largest exporter of crude oil and the source of the country’s flourishing finances</s>
<s>oil prices have averaged about $110 a barrel this year and for months aramco has been pumping around 10m barrels a day bd one of its highest rates</s>
<s>the energy information administration the american energy department’s statistical arm says saudi arabia’s net oil income in 2011 was $311 billion</s>

<p>
<s>yet the people who run the kingdom want to curb the bonanza</s>
<s>in march king abdullah and his council of ministers began a strategy to soften oil markets fearing that lofty prices were bruising the world’s economy and would hurt demand for oil in the long run</s>
<s>since then the longserving saudi oil minister ali naimi has repeatedly sought to talk down the market insisting that global supply and demand do not justify current prices</s>
<s>new gas production has helped to free up for export crude that is burned in local power stations</s>
<s>“oil above $100 a barrel is bad for business” says a source close to the minister</s>
<s>mr naimi says cheaper oil could be a “stimulus” for the world economy</s>

<s>the kingdom is also defending its market share</s>
<s>high prices are encouraging the production of unconventional or trickytoextract oil elsewhere</s>
<s>rising output in north america threatens to offset imports to the united states the world’s greediest oil consumer and still saudi arabia’s most reliable customer</s>

<s>geopolitics plays a part too</s>
<s>western politicians want the saudis to produce still more oil to plug gaps left by the embargo on iran</s>
<s>before western governments imposed evertighter sanctions against iran earlier this year they sought saudi assurances</s>
<s>saudi arabia denies it took an active part in inflicting suffering on a fellow member of opec the international oilexporters’ club</s>
<s>“but if it makes them weaker and less likely to attack us then that’s good” says a saudi oil official</s>
<s>some say that sunni saudi arabia wishes to punish shia iran and shialed iraq two rivals of the saudis that both depend on tripledigit oil prices to keep their economies afloat</s>

<p>
<s>however saudi efforts to bring prices down have yet to work</s>
<s>another saudi supply pledge in midseptember took a few dollars off the price but the kingdom’s sway over oil markets is not what it was</s>
<s>it rarely sells in the spot market preferring longterm customers it offers discounts even less often</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover saudi arabia itself cannot afford to prompt a fullblown meltdown of the oil price</s>
<s>the king’s spending on social projects has soared since uprisings began across the arab world</s>
<s>years of high oil prices have left the saudi budget in better shape than others</s>
<s>but deutsche bank says it still needs to sell oil for more than $78 a barrel to break even</s>
<s>if oil prices were to slide steeply in the coming months the kingdom’s campaign to bring them down would end very sharply indeed</s>
