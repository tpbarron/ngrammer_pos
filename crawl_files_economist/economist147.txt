<s>among the many mysteries spawned by barack obamas first two years in office one of the most striking is why so few republicans have lined up to take him on in 2012</s>
<s>that the “grand old party” considers his tenure a disaster for america is indisputable</s>
<s>and his tribulations in office have left him looking more vulnerable than anyone could have imagined on inauguration day</s>
<s>yet against the trend towards everearlier starts of presidential campaigns only two republicans behaved in 2010 as if they were gearing up to run</s>
<s>in 2011 that will change—dramatically—as a swarm of wannabe nominees chuck their hats into the ring</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the top of the list is one of the two men who have already made their intentions clear mitt romney a former governor of massachusetts</s>
<s>mr romney runnerup to john mccain in 2008 is for now the oddson favourite to secure his partys nomination</s>
<s>his goal over the past two years has been to solidify his position as the consensus candidate of the republican establishment—publishing a bestselling book travelling the country and raising money for republican candidates courting donors and schmoozing party poobahs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but mr romney has his problems many of them familiar from his previous bid for the white house his history of flipflops on contentious issues such as abortion his inability to connect in a visceral way with voters and yes his mormonism which some evangelicals see as a cult</s>
<s>the largest obstacle facing him however is something new the healthcare plan he enacted in massachusetts was a model for mr obamas the denunciation of which will be central to republican efforts to unseat the president</s>
<s>mr romney spent 2010 trying in vain to formulate a pithy way of explaining away the similarities between his policy and mr obamas</s>
<s>he will spend 2011 doing the same almost certainly to no avail—because the similarities are real and inescapable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other republican who has been active on the hustings is minnesotas governor tim pawlenty the runnerup to sarah palin in john mccains selection of a no</s>
<s>2 for the republican 2008 ticket</s>
<s>mr pawlenty is an intelligent everyman type of candidate and a fine retail politician but he lacks charisma a compelling vision or a substantial base of donors</s>
<s>in 2011 he will work on those weaknesses emerging as an attractive darkhorse candidate and again as a plausible runningmate for the eventual nominee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in republican circles many believe that two of the most promising potential aspirants to that position are a pair of governors who happen to be close friends haley barbour of mississippi and mitch daniels of indiana</s>
<s>both are longtime players at the national level mr barbour was the partys chairman in the 1990s and mr daniels served as george bush juniors first budget director</s>
<s>mr barbours strengths include charm a silver tongue watching a debate with mr obama would be a treat and an ability to raise a tonne of money with a snap of his fingers</s>
<s>mr danielss revolve around his policy expertise nononsense style and ironically his lack of glamour a short balding man with zero flash he would make an ideal antiobama</s>
<s>both men are mulling running</s>
<s>because of their friendship both wont do so but one of them will</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>equally certain is that newt gingrich will hurl himself into the fray</s>
<s>the former speaker of the house and architect of the 1990s republican revolution has long toyed with a presidential bid and now he believes the time has come</s>
<s>mr gingrich has a chequered personal history but a passionate following among grassroots conservatives that will make him more formidable than many expect—until he commits some appalling gaffe which for him is roughly as inevitable as the sun rising in the east</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>watch out for the palin primary and bush iii</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no republican has more star quality than mr gingrich—except of course for mrs palin</s>
<s>in 2010 the former governor of alaska bestselling author fox news pundit and habituée of facebook and twitter emerged as the nations most powerful republican with a large and devoted base of fans especially among the newly ascendant teaparty movement</s>
<s>mrs palin faces a monumental choice in 2011 should she run for president or stay on the sidelines where her influence would be enormous and her endorsement avidly sought</s>
<s>call it the palin primary</s>
<s> her inbuilt constituency name recognition and ability to command walltowall media attention mean that her decision can and will come late in the year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plenty of other republicans are contemplating a run</s>
<s>but the one who would make the strongest nominee claims to be giving it no thought jeb bush</s>
<s>the former governor of florida will definitely seek the big prize one day</s>
<s>but when</s>
<s>conventional wisdom holds that the bush name is still so toxic that he should wait</s>
<s>yet the conventional wisdom argued strongly against mr obama seeking the white house in 2008 and we all know how that turned out</s>
<s>for mr bush 2011 will be the year of a thousand phone calls from republicans begging him to take the plunge</s>
<s>watching mr romney mr pawlenty and others do so—and believing himself the better of every one of them—mr bush will find it very hard to resist</s>
