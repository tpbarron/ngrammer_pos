<s>hot on the heels of results from fermilab in america which reported last week on an esoteric phenomenon called chargeconjugationparity cp violation involving equally esoteric subatomic particles known as d0mesons a second research group the daya bay collaboration of more than 40 institutions mainly from china and america has found a related result involving neutrinos</s>
<s>cp violation is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter and the experiment based at a complex of nuclear reactors 50km 30 miles north of hong kong has settled a longstanding puzzle that bears on the question of whether neutrinos too experience it</s>
<s>that in turn is related to the deeper question of why the universe is made of matter rather than having originally had equal amounts of matter and antimatter</s>
<s>if such a primordial equity had prevailed the two would have annihilated each other leaving a universe filled only with energy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>strictly speaking the daya bay experiment looked at antineutrinos rather than neutrinos</s>
<s>these particles are a byproduct of nuclear fission and the six reactors at daya bay and nearby ling ao turn them out in prodigious quantities</s>
<s>the idea was to see how many of these antineutrinos disappear before reaching the experiments main detector pictured above which is housed in an underground hall near the reactors</s>
<s>this the team hoped would help elucidate a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neutrinos and antineutrinos come in three “flavours” electronneutrinos muonneutrinos and tauneutrinos</s>
<s>a given neutrino can however oscillate between these flavours</s>
<s>as a consequence some of the electronantineutrinos spewed out by the reactors were expected to morph into other sorts and thus escape detection by apparatus designed to count only electronantineutrinos</s>
<s>and the researchers did indeed observe 6 fewer of the beasts than would have been the case if no oscillations had taken place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the way neutrinos oscillate is described by three numbers called mixing angles which determine how likely this spotchanging is for any pair of flavours</s>
<s>two of the angles have been known for some time</s>
<s>the remaining one theta13 which governs the relationship between electron and tauneutrinos has proved elusive</s>
<s>last year two experiments t2k in japan and minos in america found hints of what it might be</s>
<s>the results from daya bay have at last allowed it to be determined accurately</s>
<s>to many physicists relief they have confirmed that it is not zero</s>
<s>this is crucial because if it had been zero they would have no experimental purchase on a fourth parameter called delta</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>delta is a measure of how much neutrinos feel cp violation</s>
<s>and cp violation in neutrinos is something theorists can parlay into oodles of universepreserving matterantimatter asymmetry</s>
<s>experiments like those at daya bay involving antineutrinos from reactors cannot measure delta directly</s>
<s>but the collaborations result bodes well for those that can</s>
<s>these include t2k and minos both of which use particle accelerators to whip up beams of muonneutrinos and send them to detectors hundreds of kilometres away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>t2k was shut down by the earthquake and tsunami which shook japan a year ago but it has been back in business since january</s>
<s>in america meanwhile minos is being replaced with a fancier experiment called nova which will start collecting data in 2013</s>
<s>with luck then the matterantimatter conundrum—and with it the reason anything exists at all—will not remain a mystery much longer</s>
