<s>five years ago things looked rosy</s>
<s>in the first week of august 2007 forecasts by investors and major central banks predicted growth rates of 23 in america and europe</s>
<s>but on august 9th 2007 everything changed</s>
<s>a french bank bnp paribas announced big losses on subprimemortgage investments</s>
<s>the same day the european central bank ecb was forced to inject €95 billion $130 billion at the time of emergency liquidity</s>
<s>the crisis had begun</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>during the first year policymakers looked to japan as a guide or rather a warning</s>
<s>japan’s debt bubble had caused a “lost decade” from 1991 to 2001</s>
<s>analysts commonly drew three lessons</s>
<s>to avoid japanesestyle stagnation it was vital first to act fast second to clean up battered balancesheets and third to provide a bold economic stimulus</s>
<s>if japan is taken as the yardstick america and britain have a mixed record</s>
<s>the euro area looks as if it might be turning japanese</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>debts took years to build up</s>
<s>take the american consumer</s>
<s>debt was around 70 of gdp in 2000 and grew at around 4 percentage points a year to reach close to 100 of gdp by 2007</s>
<s>the same was true of european banks and governments debts rose hugely but steadily</s>
<s>it was not hard to spot debt mountains forming</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the crisis erupted with the realisation that subprime exposures were widespread</s>
<s>many assets were worth less in the market than they had been bought for</s>
<s>debts started to look unsustainable and interest rates jumped</s>
<s>this meant governments consumers and banks after building up debt slowly suddenly faced much higher costs as debts matured and they were forced to refinance at higher rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reaction was quick</s>
<s>by the end of 2008 the federal reserve the ecb and the bank of england had slashed official interest rates</s>
<s>their aim was to offset the spike in debt costs that companies and consumers were facing</s>
<s>the cuts were fast by japanese standards see top righthand chart</s>
<s>it seemed the first lesson had been learnt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>falling asset prices meant that many banks and firms had debts that outweighed their assets</s>
<s>the japanese experience showed that the next job was to deal with these broken balancesheets</s>
<s>there are three main options renegotiate debt raise equity or go bankrupt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the efforts to reinvigorate balancesheets debt investors have reigned supreme</s>
<s>debts have been honoured</s>
<s>indeed a recent report from deutsche bank shows that even investors in risky highyield debt have had five great years</s>
<s>bank bonds in america have returned 31 in europe 25</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as asset values fell debt maintained its fixed value</s>
<s>this meant that equity the balancesheet shockabsorber had to fall in value</s>
<s>so although debt caused the problem equity took the pain</s>
<s>a dow jones index of bank equity is down by more than 60 since 2007 according to deutsche bank</s>
<s>some banks’ share prices are down by more than 95</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in many cases the equity buffers were too small so governments stepped in taking equity stakes in banks</s>
<s>in both america and europe governments stood behind their financial sectors</s>
<s>balancesheets were repaired</s>
<s>it seemed the second lesson from japan had been learnt too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the cleanup just moved the problem on</s>
<s>governments borrowed to fund the bailouts</s>
<s>so banks’ balancesheets were strengthened at the expense of public ones</s>
<s>america’s support for the banks cost 5 of gdp britain’s cash injection into its ailing banks was 9 of gdp</s>
<s>and household debt was still high</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a third lesson from japan was to seek a strong stimulus in a growing economy high debt need not be a problem</s>
<s>take a household’s finances</s>
<s>a large mortgage is fine as long as breadwinners’ incomes are sufficient to pay the interest and leave some to spare</s>
<s>inflation helps too as debts are fixed at their historical values but wages should rise with inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>following japan’s example central banks engaged in “quantitative easing” qe buying bonds for newly created cash see bottom lefthand chart</s>
<s>this aims to drive up bond prices lowering yields and making debt manageable</s>
<s>the qe programmes have been bolder than japan’s and corporatebond yields have indeed fallen see buttonwood</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but although policymakers learnt some lessons from japan there are reasons to worry about the next five years</s>
<s>in britain and america there are two main concerns</s>
<s>first the fiscal stimulus may not be bold enough and in britain is being withdrawn before the economy is back on its feet</s>
<s>having supported banks governments are trying to cut deficits and have little to spend</s>
<s>richard koo of nomura a bank reckons japan’s experience shows that governments should increase borrowing to mop up privatesector savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second government bailouts can have longterm costs</s>
<s>in some cases broken balancesheets are a sign of a broken business model bankruptcy is then a better option cleansing the economy of unproductive firms</s>
<s>japan kept too many bad firms going</s>
<s>there are signs of that in america and britain too</s>
<s>the american government’s bailouts ran to over $601 billion with 928 recipients across banking insurance and car industries</s>
<s>britain has large stakes in two of its four big banks and has no clear plans to sell them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the euro area is in a more dangerous position</s>
<s>its recovery has been painfully slow see bottom righthand chart</s>
<s>its prospects look grim data released on august 1st showed german french and italian manufacturing contracting at an increasing rate dragging britain down with them</s>
<s>and to the meagre stimulus and zombification of industry can be added a third japanese trait—policy indecision</s>
<s>on august 2nd mario draghi the ecbs head indicated the banks readiness to buy bonds again as part of a coordinated rescue plan</s>
<s>stockmarkets initially fell suggesting the investors are unconvinced that it will save the euro area from aping japan</s>
