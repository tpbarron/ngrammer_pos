<s>when a year ago zimbabwe confirmed plans to make all white and foreignowned companies cede a 51 stake of their local operations to black zimbabweans it was taken as a bit of a joke—another populist ploy by president robert mugabes zanupf party to attract support ahead of impending elections</s>
<s>as late as last august david brown head of impala platinum the worlds secondbiggest platinum producer was still “confident that the 51 will not happen”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>well it has done leaving other miners in zimbabwe shaking in their boots</s>
<s>after months of haggling and threats impala this week announced a plan to transfer “at an appropriate value” a 51 holding in zimplats its zimbabwean subsidiary</s>
<s>zimplats in which impala has an 87 stake is the biggest platinum producer in the country with a market value of around $12 billion</s>
<s>together with the smaller mimosa mine in zimbabwe in which impala owns a 50 stake it accounts for over 40 of the londonlisted miners global platinum reserves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>saviour kasukuwere zimbabwes powerful minister of indigenisation and youth has accepted the plan in principle as complying with the indigenisation law</s>
<s>but the details—particularly what price will be paid for the shares—have been left to a joint technical team</s>
<s>in the past mr kasukuwere has insisted there will be no compensation because “the minerals under the ground already belong to us</s>
<s>so why should we pay” besides the cashstrapped government which pays employees an average of just $250 a month does not have the funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under impalas proposals a 10 stake in zimplats would be sold to a community trust and a further 10 to an employee trust after an independent valuation</s>
<s>zimplats will lend the two trusts the money for the share purchases which they will repay from dividends—assuming these continue</s>
<s>the company expects “fairvalue compensation” for a tract of land ceded to the government in 2006</s>
<s>only on receipt of that zimplats says would it “make available for sale” a final 31 stake for cash “at an independently determined fair value”</s>
<s>but the government has not yet agreed to any of this</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after a decade of recession between 1998 and 2008 when gdp halved zimbabwes economy is growing again thanks to the replacement of its worthless currency by the dollar in 2009 and the worldwide commodity boom</s>
<s>but foreign investors are sorely needed to ensure that the recovery continues</s>
<s>they are reluctant to commit themselves as long as what one potential investor described as “this madness” continues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and continue it will</s>
<s>buoyed by winning his first big scalp mr kasukuwere will now be pursuing others including foreignowned banks and retailers with threats of revoking licences seizing assets and even jailing executives</s>
<s>he says he wants the whole indigenisation process completed before the elections</s>
<s>those could be held later this year if mr mugabe gets his way</s>
