<s>“we must dare to dream to do and to build” as his words to the 1960 democratic convention suggest pat brown was a firm believer in the power of government to get things done</s>
<s>as governor of california between 1959 and 1967 he harnessed the energies and revenues of a rapidly growing state to create waterdiversion projects construct a statewide public highereducation system and build roads across the state</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>conditions for such schemes are less propitious today when budget crises are as regular a feature of the californian calendar as the oscars</s>
<s>but pat brown’s son jerry now serving his second stint as governor appears to have decided that the time is right to splurge political capital on a new round of expensive infrastructure projects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the most contentious is a proposed highspeed rail link between the big metropolitan centres of the state</s>
<s>construction on the first section is due to begin next year in california’s depressed central valley after a tight vote in the state senate in early july</s>
<s>but the $125 billion or so of state and federal funds earmarked for the project so far represents less than 20 of the projected total cost of $68 billion and that figure will surely rise</s>
<s>if money or political will dries up before construction extends to san francisco or los angeles the fear is that the state will be left with that dread prospect a train to nowhere</s>
<s>voters approved the project in 2008 today most say they want to scrap it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>also on the governor’s todo list is a revival of an old plan to build pipelines to divert water from the sacramento river in central california to the drier southern part</s>
<s>the price tag for this project is $14 billion and on top of financial and environmental worries come fears of a revival of the “water wars” that have historically soured relations between southern california and the rest of the state</s>
<s>but mr brown has a response to the worrywarts unveiling the water scheme on july 25th he said his priority was “to get shit done”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr brown has always enjoyed thinking big and california unemployment rate 107 could do with the jobs his schemes would bring</s>
<s>but the timing of the governor’s new enthusiasm seems odd</s>
<s>for just as he promotes his projects he is spending millions on television spots urging californians to back a ballot measure in november that would raise sales and income taxes in order to plug the state’s fiscal gap</s>
<s>if the initiative fails cuts worth $6 billion are set to be triggered with schools and universities taking the biggest hit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the capital for mr brown’s plans would not tap the “general fund” the main state budget although payments on project bonds would</s>
<s>but that subtlety may be lost on some voters and there is a danger of giving out mixed messages</s>
<s>“politically i don’t understand the governor’s strategy” says sherry bebitch jeffe an analyst at the university of southern california</s>
<s>onethird of voters say the rail plan would turn them against the tax initiative</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some have suggested that the 74yearold mr brown wants consciously or otherwise to leave the same imprint on california as his father did</s>
<s>ethan rarick author of a biography of pat notes that his subject often ignored advice to hold back on his own projects</s>
<s>but in jerry’s case he adds “it’s hard to see what the rush is”</s>
