<s>trade and growth go hand in hand</s>
<s>when the economic crisis first hit in 2008 world trade and growth collapsed together</s>
<s>in 2009 both recovered and did reasonably well until this year when both slipped again see article</s>
<s>cutting tariffs and red tape would boost trade and support the faltering recovery</s>
<s>this should spur efforts to replace the failed doha trade talks with a new effort to do a multilateral deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the aims of the doha round launched by the world trade organisation wto in 2001 were laudable</s>
<s>it deliberately put poor countries first placing particular priority on improving the access of their farmers to richcountry markets</s>
<s>it was ambitious too covering not only trade in manufactured goods agriculture and services but also a host of things more indirectly related to trade antitrust intellectual property and foreigninvestment rules for example</s>
<s>according to the peterson institute a thinktank the potential gains were around $280 billion a year</s>
<s>its failure is a tragedy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the villains are powerful lobbies notably in agriculture such as america’s cotton and sugar industries and japan’s rice farmers and fishermen</s>
<s>but there were also two structural problems with doha</s>
<s>one was the number of countries</s>
<s>at the end of the first worldtrade talks in 1947 23 countries were involved</s>
<s>when doha started 155 were</s>
<s>second the idea was to achieve a grand bargain in which agriculture manufacturing and services would all be liberalised</s>
<s>but reaching agreement on some areas was so difficult that the wto’s mantra— “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”—proved fatal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>less ambition more achievement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after many missed chances to conclude a deal an “absolute deadline” was set for december 31st 2011</s>
<s>that too was missed</s>
<s>since then protectionism has been intensifying</s>
<s>in the past two weeks argentina has lodged complaints against america over lemons and beef and against spain over biofuels</s>
<s>altogether titfortat actions mean that new restrictions cover 4 of global trade more than africa’s exports</s>
<s>on the plus side disputes over these are being adjudicated by the wto system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with doha paralysed regional alternatives to a multilateral deal are springing up</s>
<s>they are not all bad but regional deals tend to benefit insiders at the expense of outsiders so that global gains will be achieved only if they can be fitted together</s>
<s>and the small deals often enshrine rules—such as electrical and emissions standards—which vary from region to region so they make global deals harder to forge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of allowing the doha round to be replaced with a patchwork of regional deals the wto’s boss pascal lamy should close it and resurrect the best bits in a “global recovery round”</s>
<s>he should drop the allornothing “single undertaking” rule that helped kill doha</s>
<s>instead talks would be broken up into small chunks and allowed to progress independently of one another</s>
<s>negotiations would be open so that any member could leave or join</s>
<s>some deals therefore would not include everyone</s>
<s>but another of the wto’s guiding principles—the “mostfavourednation” clause—must apply</s>
<s>this rule means that any deal between a smaller group must be applied to all wto members even if they do not reciprocate</s>
<s>wtobrokered regionalism would thus lower trade barriers for all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the global recovery round should focus on manufacturing and services</s>
<s>manufacturing represents around 55 of total trade</s>
<s>there is much to be gained tariffs on cars buses and bicycles are still high</s>
<s>even lowtariff countries maintain a selection of high ones</s>
<s>in america ski boots attract a zero tariff but golf shoes can face a 10 rate and steeltoecapped boots 375</s>
<s>services which account for only 20 of world trade but are more important on a valueadded basis have hardly been liberalised at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if progress on agriculture is slower so be it</s>
<s>farm protectionism which this newspaper was founded to oppose still starves millions</s>
<s>new madnesses appear by the day russia has blocked the import of pigs from the eu because of a virus that affects cows and sheep</s>
<s>but an industry that makes up only 7 of world trade cannot hold everything else hostage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the timing should be as tight as possible</s>
<s>when g20 finance ministers meet in mexico city in november 2012 they should ask the wto to launch the global recovery round and to finish it by the time of the wto’s next big meeting in bali in december 2013</s>
<s>it would be the best thing to happen to the world economy for five years</s>
