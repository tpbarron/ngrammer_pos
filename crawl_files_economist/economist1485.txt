<s>one of the questions that the parents of any young child dread the most is “but why” children quickly discover to their great delight that this is a valid response to any answer to a previous question</s>
<s>a persistent child and a patient parent will soon be grappling with the question of why the universe exists at all</s>
<s>at this point the adult will be forced to concede defeat irritably</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most adults at any rate</s>
<s>not so jim holt an american writer and philosopher who has chosen to tackle this question headon in his latest book</s>
<s>his attempt to find an answer to the biggest of all questions brings him into the company of others who have given it some thought including philosophers religious thinkers scientists and even the odd novelist</s>
<s>the result is an eclectic mix of theology cuttingedge science of the cosmological and particlephysics variety and extremely abstract philosophising rendered mostly accessible by mr holt’s facility with analogies and clear witty language</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some of the arguments he traces are familiar from various attempts to prove the logical necessity of the existence of god to speculations among more adventurous physicists that the universe got its start as a kind of lucky quantum burp</s>
<s>but there are some odd and less familiar shores too such as an attempt to tie existence to an alleged necessity for goodness</s>
<s>there is also the argument that the universe exists because there are many more ways to exist than there are not to exist—and so existence is more probable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is not a book for the impatient or even the terribly pragmatic</s>
<s>more practical readers will warm to adolf grünbaum a professor at the university of pittsburgh who insists that the question is a waste of time</s>
<s>he argues that it is a lingering ghost of the judaeochristian worldview among philosophers who ought to know better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr holt’s decision to tell this story through interviews with individual thinkers rather than as a list of competing hyperabstract ideas helps to keep his book relatively grounded</s>
<s>but a certain amount of abstruseness is inevitable given the subject matter</s>
<s>so readers must still wade through occasional sentences such as “all art religion science and institutions are gathered into this process expressing some part of the great spiritual journey whereby the empty ii takes on flesh so as to know itself at last as an ordered and objective reality and also free”—although in fairness to mr holt this is a quote from another philosopher</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the question of existence is unlikely to be solved in a work of popular philosophy</s>
<s>indeed as mr holt admits at the outset there are strong reasons to believe it will never be solved at all</s>
<s>but the absence of a definitive answer does not make the quest itself any less enjoyable as a bout of intellectual callisthenics</s>
<s>the subtitle—“an existential detective story”—is apt as some readers will enjoy trying to anticipate the holes in each argument before mr holt points them out</s>
