<s>some perils are easier to dodge than others</s>
<s>a helicopter equipped with honeywell’s latest safety system can spot danger through dense cloud</s>
<s>it can even spot hazards that don’t yet exist</s>
<s>if the pilot flies towards the top storeys of new york’s freedom tower—which have not yet been built—the control panel flashes red and warns him to change course</s>

<s>america’s fiscal peril is easy to see but the pilots are squabbling over the controls while the economy hurtles towards disaster</s>
<s>at the beginning of next year federal tax increases and spending cuts equivalent to about 5 of gdp will automatically come into force</s>
<s>america will go over this “fiscal cliff” unless democrats and republicans in congress agree on a deal to avoid it</s>
<s>so far they show little sign of agreeing on anything except that the other side is to blame for their failure to compromise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for corporate america this is terrifying</s>
<s>going over the fiscal cliff could knock enough points off the growth rate to drive america into a recession predicts the congressional budget office a nonpartisan body that analyses the economic effects of federal laws</s>
<s>“everybody’s nervous” says david cote honeywell’s boss</s>
<s>“it could cause a global recession” frets klaus kleinfeld the chief executive of alcoa an aluminium firm—though he doubts it will actually happen</s>

<p>
<s>the cliff exists because several temporary measures are set to expire at the same time</s>
<s>george w bush’s tax cuts which were extended for two years under barack obama are due to run out at the end of 2012</s>
<s>so are mr obama’s temporary jobs measures such as a payrolltax holiday and extended unemployment benefits</s>
<s>the alternative minimum tax a levy originally aimed at the rich is set to hit 30m middleclass americans</s>
<s>medicare the federal health programme for the elderly will slash payments to doctors by nearly 30</s>
<s>and thanks to the failure of a congressional “budget supercommittee” to agree on a debtreduction deal last year automatic cuts in federal spending are due to start on january 15th</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all told america faces a fiscal squeeze equivalent to more than $600 billion in a single calendar year and $61 trillion over ten years</s>
<s>nothing will change before the election and there is probably not enough time after it and before the end of the year for lawmakers to thrash out a proper budget deal</s>
<s>so a temporary fix is likely</s>
<s>some tightening will probably occur regardless of any deal but no one knows how much</s>

<s>how are companies responding</s>
<s>“we’re not hiring” says mr cote</s>
<s>he is far from alone</s>
<s>jp morgan an investment bank reports that 61 of its american clients say the fiscal cliff is affecting their hiring plans</s>
<s>that is one reason why unemployment is so high</s>
<s>durablegoods orders plunged 132 in august partly because companies are too scared to invest their cash mountains to expand production</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they don’t know what tax rates will be next year</s>
<s>they don’t know whether their customers will suddenly start shopping around for cheaper groceries—the tax policy center a thinktank predicts that the expiry of all mr bush’s tax cuts would raise taxes by $3500 per household</s>
<s>businesses also don’t know whether the government will rein in spending that affects them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>military contractors face a walloping since half the spending cuts will come from the pentagon’s budget</s>
<s>“we’re worried” admits a defencefirm director</s>
<s>hospitals are worried too</s>

<s>uncertainty makes planning hard</s>
<s>that has consequences</s>
<s>“if you can’t plan you don’t invest</s>
<s>if you can’t invest you won’t hire” says bruce josten of the us chamber of commerce a business lobby</s>
<s>uncertainty about future economic conditions has added at least a percentage point to the unemployment rate according to sylvain leduc and zheng liu of the federal reserve bank of san francisco</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a survey by the national federation of independent business a smallbusiness lobby supports this theory</s>
<s>the top ten problems cited by the nfib’s members include “uncertainty over economic conditions” “uncertainty over government actions” and “frequent changes in federal tax laws and rules” see table</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>businessbacked groups such as the campaign to fix the debt argue that in the medium term congress needs to bring america’s swelling debts under control</s>
<s>all plausible deals to do this involve both tax hikes which republicans oppose and cuts to entitlements which democrats hate</s>
<s>the choice says mr cote is between fixing the budget “thoughtfully and proactively” or waiting “until the bond market forces us to do it like greece did”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some say the best tactic would be to walk one pace over the cliff and then turn back</s>
<s>many republicans have sworn never to raise taxes which means they cannot agree to let any of mr bush’s tax cuts expire</s>
<s>but if no deal is reached and they expire automatically restoring them for households that earn less than $250000 a year which the democrats want would count as a tax cut so republicans could agree to it without breaking their pledge</s>
<s>this sleight of hand was devised by william gale of the brookings institution a thinktank and peter orszag a former budget director for mr obama</s>
<s>will it fool anyone</s>
<s>perhaps</s>

<s>benjamin franklin once said “nothing is certain but death and taxes” these days taxes are far from certain</s>
