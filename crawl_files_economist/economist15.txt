<s>betting against chinese firms with listings abroad has proved very good business over the past couple of years</s>
<s>many of these firms used reverse takeovers rts a regulatory loophole which allowed an unlisted firm to acquire a publicly listed shell company and to circumvent the regulatory scrutiny of a normal initial public offering as an easy way to list in america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>shares in these firms have plunged see chart thanks partly to evidence of a slowdown in china but also to a series of wellpublicised attacks from shortsellers</s>
<s>the likes of muddy waters citron research and anonymous analytics have issued reports accusing firms such as sino forest a forestry firm and longtop a software company of fraud</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>few of these firms have fought back effectively</s>
<s>but now a counterattack against the shortsellers is on</s>
<s>kaifu lee the former boss of google’s china arm runs innovation works a chinese venturecapital fund cum incubator</s>
<s>angered by what he sees as egregious mistakes in a recent report by citron on qihoo 360 technology a chinese internet firm listed in new york he marshalled five dozen chinese technology investors and entrepreneurs to denounce citron’s “lies”</s>
<s>xinhua an official news agency has since supported his cause suggesting that china’s regulators are also growing concerned about the supposed threat posed by shortsellers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr lee says he has no problem with shortsellers in principle but loathes those that profit by making wild claims that put honest companies under a cloud</s>
<s>andrew left citron’s founder accepts he may have “simplified” some aspects of his latest report for a western audience but denies wilful misrepresentation</s>
<s>he argues that mr lee is upset because his investigations have made it harder for mr lee’s firm to find exits for his portfolio companies a point mr lee acknowledges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many sympathise with mr lee’s arguments</s>
<s>one western financier says of the shortsellers “there is a game being played here to create panic” fitch a ratings agency has argued that the “increased market volatility and uncertainty introduced by ‘whistleblowing’ shortsellers of chinese companies is likely to outweigh any positives for investors from improved corporate governance and transparency”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and there is fresh evidence about their wider effects</s>
<s>a new paper by rong huang and colleagues at baruch college part of the city university of new york scrutinises the impact of shortseller attacks not just on the targeted chinese firms themselves but also on chinese firms that did not use rts to list themselves abroad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>investors ought to make a distinction</s>
<s>chinese firms that listed using rts are smaller carry lower analysts’ ratings and have higher leverage than those that did not use rts</s>
<s>the number of fraud cases observed by the academics in the first half of 2011 at chinese firms that used rts was more than triple that seen at american rts</s>
<s>none was observed at chinese firms listed in america without using rts</s>
<s>but when the boffins crunched the numbers they found that the shares of chinese firms that did not use rts were also punished heavily by the market along with those that did</s>
<s>this “china bashing” they argue means “investors are throwing the baby out with the bathwater”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr left remains unbowed boasting that his record is better even than the more famous muddy waters</s>
<s>he points out that nearly all of his prior chinese targets have since faced regulatory action had auditors resign or even been delisted altogether</s>
<s>this necessary weeding out during china’s “growing pains” he thinks will eventually make it easier for honest chinese companies to raise capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he gets support from unexpected quarters</s>
<s>john quelch dean of the china europe international business school in shanghai is no fan of shortsellers indeed he has served on the boards of firms attacked by them</s>
<s>nevertheless he rejects the idea that solid firms cannot survive an attack by them because of antichina bias in the market</s>
<s>“it’s simply not true if it’s a substantive firm it can survive” to do so he insists such a firm “must build its brand reputation” so that it stands apart from the many obscure chinese firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on this point one of the most experienced international accountants working in china agrees</s>
<s>an attack by shortsellers need not wipe out a firm if it gets proper audits done ensures it has independent directors and explains itself forcefully and well</s>
<s>as for the impact on honest firms he invokes a local proverb “the healthy egg doesn’t attract flies”</s>
