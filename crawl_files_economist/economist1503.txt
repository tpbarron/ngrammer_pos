<s>after the french socialists last came to power in 1981 under françois mitterrand the new government went on a spree of nationalisations taking over 36 banks and several industrial groups before quietly abandoning the policy and even reprivatising a few firms</s>
<s>small wonder that french bosses greeted françois hollandes election as president with more than a frisson of foreboding</s>
<s>what would the socialists do this time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the answer is that mr hollande seems to want to put a break on the schumpeterian forces of creative destruction in order to conserve the countrys business landscape in aspic</s>
<s>even before the parliamentary elections on june 17th at which the socialists won a majority of seats rhetoric against factory closures had been mounting</s>
<s>arnaud montebourg a leftwing politician who is now minister for “productive recovery” fought hard against closures during the campaign</s>
<s>when lejaby a lingerie brand made plans to shut its last french plant and move production to tunisia he came out in support of the brassière tricolore in the end lvmh a luxurygoods group rescued the bra factory</s>
<s>he even wants to keep companies from moving within france</s>
<s>he protested loudly when kawan villages a struggling camping operator recently tried to shift its tents from burgundy down to the southwest taking all its workers with it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now the new government is going beyond rhetoric</s>
<s>michel sapin the labour minister has promised to make it so expensive for companies to lay off workers that it will no longer be worth their while</s>
<s>firms that fire people while still paying dividends may be penalised</s>
<s>another planned ruse is to force companies to sell factories presumably along with the brands manufactured there to competitors rather than close them down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the government will struggle to contain market forces</s>
<s>many companies put off restructuring plans during the election campaign so as to avoid controversy</s>
<s>now an avalanche of layoffs is in prospect</s>
<s>the confédération générale du travail a powerful union has given warning that as many as 45000 jobs are under threat as firms such as psa peugeotcitroën a car manufacturer with falling sales and carrefour a struggling retailer prepare to retrench</s>
<s>in some cases firms could founder if they are not allowed to cut costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the socialists are unlikely to be terribly successful at preventing the destruction of jobs but they may be all too effective however unintentionally at stifling job creation</s>
<s>among the partys most popular campaign promises was to tax incomes of more than €1m at a marginal rate of 75</s>
<s>the likely consequences will be much less admired</s>
<s>some big companies will leave france or move management abroad in order to shield their executives from the tax</s>
<s>that will lead them to invest and hire more overseas rather than at home</s>
<s>already top foreign executives no longer want to join french firms</s>
<s>a new extra tax on dividends has further angered the business world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont forget to turn out the lights</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>paris is full of rumours of hasty departures</s>
<s>ppr a luxurygoods group which owns gucci and yves saint laurent is reported to have plans to move its entire executive committee to offices in london as soon as this summer</s>
<s>technip a global oilservices firm is rumoured to be about to move its official headquarters across the channel</s>
<s>ppr declined to comment and technip said it has no plans to move for now</s>
<s> to the fury of a french member of parliament david cameron britains prime minister this week promised to “roll out the red carpet” for french companies on the run from the new tax</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the most important consequence of stratospheric taxes will be less visible at least at first</s>
<s>marc simoncini is one of frances bestknown entrepreneurs—and one of the few business leaders to denounce the new measures publicly</s>
<s>why he recently asked would anyone want to start a business invest and succeed in the most taxed country in the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tax is not the only threat to executive pay</s>
<s>last week pierre moscovici the finance minister announced that pay for bosses of companies in which the french state holds the majority of shares will be capped at a flat rate of €450000 or roughly 20 times the wage of the lowestpaid worker</s>
<s>the french experiment will no doubt be watched with interest around the rich world</s>
<s>in some cases it will lead to a 70 pay cut</s>
<s>over time the quality of management at these state firms which had become more professional over the past decade will surely suffer</s>
<s>executives such as guillaume pepy the boss of sncf the national railways for instance could secure a top position anywhere in his industry</s>
<s>measures to limit pay at fully private firms are expected before long</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most french business leaders dont think that the government is deliberately targeting them</s>
<s>they reckon that its motives are purely political—and that the socialists are simply not aware of the damage their plans will do most ministers have hardly any experience of business</s>
<s>besides the 75 tax rate might never be implemented frances highest court may rule it unconstitutional later this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet french bosses have partly themselves to blame for the way they are being treated</s>
<s>almost all have benefited from the tight bond that exists between the top ranks of frances civil service and the countrys senior executives</s>
<s>many are alumni of the same grandes écoles such as the ecole nationale dadministration</s>
<s>government aides are regularly parachuted into jobs even at firms not controlled by the government</s>
<s>and some bosses later become ministers</s>
<s>if both groups were not part of the same elite and if french companies were more independent from the state they would be much less vulnerable to its whims</s>
