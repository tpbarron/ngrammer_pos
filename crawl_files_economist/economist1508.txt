<s>after the cycles of mass protests sitins and killings prompted by the military coup against the then prime minister thaksin shinawatra in 2006 most thais crave above all a return to some sort of normality even peace</s>
<s>its a sentiment that has been picked up and carefully packaged by the countrys new prime minister mr thaksins 44yearold younger sister yingluck</s>
<s>after the years of fierce ideological division between mr thaksins “red shirts” and his opponents “yellow shirts” ms yingluck promises to govern in 2012 in a spirit of compromise and to use her feminine qualities of “strength and gentleness” to heal the countrys wounds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fulfilling those promises will be hard given not just her pedigree as mr thaksins sister but also her faltering reaction to bangkoks devastating floods in october</s>
<s>still some signs are encouraging</s>
<s>whereas the style of mr thaksin a billionaire businessman was imperious ruthless and impatient ms yingluck has set out to be consensual and moderate </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for a start despite winning by a big margin she chose to govern as head of a sixparty coalition  and in a move not to antagonise her opponents ms yingluck did not appoint any unruly red shirts to her cabinet</s>
<s>several harmless technocrats got the nod instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>furthermore ms yingluck seems to be looking for some sort of grand compromise with the two most powerful institutions in thai politics the monarchy and the army which toppled her brother</s>
<s>rather than exploit her premiership to exact revenge she has sensibly decided to let them be at least for the time being</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thus the armys budget which almost doubled after the 2006 coup—in line with the increase in its political sway—will probably be left alone</s>
<s>in return the army should leave her alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its the same with the monarchy</s>
<s>ms yingluck it seems will not try to claw back any of the extra power that this revered but deeply conservative institution has accumulated since 2006</s>
<s>on becoming prime minister ms yingluck has bowed lower than anyone in acceptance of the royal prerogative to counteract suspicions that her ranks are full of closet republicans</s>
<s>equally she has shown no interest in repealing or even reviewing the countrys absurdly harsh and archaic lèsemajesté laws</s>
<s>all this will doubtless disappoint some of her supporters but it should help to win thailand a period of stable government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that would allow ms yingluck space and time to implement her many economic pledges</s>
<s>like her brother she has positioned herself as an economic populist promising to help the less welloff with rice subsidies a minimum wage of about $10 a day free tablet computers and much more</s>
<s>many businesspeople fear that such spendthrift policies will lead to budget deficits and higher inflation</s>
<s>but one thing ms yingluck did inherit from the previous government was an economy in robust good health so she and her respected finance minister thirachai phuvanatnaranubala have plenty of room to work with</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however there are two events that could easily derail ms yingluck the return of her brother and the death of the ailing king bhumibol 84 as of december 2011</s>
<s>as a fugitive from thai justice mr thaksin has had to live in exile for the past few years but if his return to his homeland seems a case of special treatment or a matter of being let off the charges against him that will surely provoke a backlash from the yellow shirts and their ilk</s>
<s>the country could be plunged back into confrontational colourcoded politics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the king dies ms yingluck will have to manage the consequences</s>
<s>the heir the crown prince is unpopular and could damage the institution</s>
<s>that too might lead to more instability</s>
<s>these are two issues of enormous sensitivity requiring all the strength and gentleness that ms yingluck can muster</s>
