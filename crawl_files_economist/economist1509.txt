<s>looking at the options when they troop into their electronic voting booths on november 6th 2012 americans might be tempted to cast a vote for none of the above</s>
<s>barack obama for all the thrill that swept his nation and the world when he was elected now seems unable to master either congress or the economy</s>
<s>republicans and democrats do not even begin to agree on what americas most serious problems are let alone on how to deal with them</s>
<s>faced with an opposition mulishly unwilling to grant him anything resembling a victory mr obama spent 2011 achieving precisely nothing as the economy stagnated and in 2012 things will be as bad or worse</s>
<s>independents have deserted him in droves and within his own democratic party the sense that he has failed to do enough for the people who elected him is palpable</s>
<s>the diminishing of a president whom so many saw as an icon of reconciliation and hope has been painful to witness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for their part the republicans too will have no achievements to boast of except negative ones</s>
<s>the party will spend much of 2012 in a battle between mitt romney and rick perry and possibly herman cain if his bubble remains unburst that long</s>
<s>the sorry truth is that there is no great enthusiasm in either of the two parties for their candidates and little among independent voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if only there were an alternative</s>
<s>but the system is stacked against thirdparty candidates mr obama faces no challenge from within his own party and all the plausible alternative republicans have ruled themselves out</s>
<s>the choice is unlikely to change beyond the obamaromneyperrycain quartet in 2012—but if it were possible what might such a fantasy president look like</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first and foremost he or she should have extensive experience of government—but preferably not in washington dc tainted as it is in the minds of voters of both left and right</s>
<s>polls regularly show that congress has an approval rating barely in double figures far worse than the presidents</s>
<s>a record of having run a state or a big city is a prerequisite for the top job combining as it does a need to work within the confines of divided government handle the press and make tough decisions on the fly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second our fantasy president should combine a strong commitment to two things</s>
<s>in the short term any fiscal tightening will have to be avoided the economy is just too weak</s>
<s>but the candidate also has to understand that tackling the deficit in the medium term is essential</s>
<s>the republican contenders have so far not made growth a priority and mr obamas commitment to deficit reduction in the medium term is far too feeble</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third america both needs and wants a president who is a strong supporter of business and a less interfering state while at the same time being liberal when it comes to social issues such as gay marriage gun control and immigration reform</s>
<s>too many americans see mr obama as an antibusiness quasisocialist while mr perrys assault on science and his fondness for executions will make him unacceptable from the other direction</s>
<s>mr romney could turn out to be plausible on this criterion he should tack to the centre in 2012 if he can bolt the nomination down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fourth an understanding of foreign affairs and a commitment to free trade are vital</s>
<s>sadly wouldbe presidents seldom have the former</s>
<s>this ought to be a big advantage for an incumbent yet mr obama has repeatedly been a disappointment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally our dream president needs to inspire not only his own supporters but those on the other side too</s>
<s>with the spirit of bipartisanship almost extinct in congress a president must talk directly to the people who elect his opponents</s>
<s>only they can force their representatives to cooperate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dream on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>would such a candidate actually be able to do much better than mr obama has done</s>
<s>probably not which is the problem with fantasies</s>
<s>even a cross between abraham lincoln and franklin roosevelt would find it hard to govern in a system where thanks to weird senate rules the minority can constantly frustrate the majority and a single senator can hold up a vital nomination indefinitely</s>
<s>an overhaul of government not just our ideal candidate is needed for 2012 and beyond</s>
<s>but that really is a dream </s>
