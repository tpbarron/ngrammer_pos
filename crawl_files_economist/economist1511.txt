<s>critics predicted the largest privateequity deals would end up like the giant python in florida which exploded in 2005 after it hungrily devoured an alligator</s>
<s>during the 200607 bubble buyout firms hunted iconic companies at skyhigh prices with oodles of borrowed money</s>
<s>then the economy turned</s>
<s>boston consulting group forecast in 2008 that the majority of companies owned by private equity would default on their debts</s>

<p>
<s>a look at the 20 largest deals however shows that most will turn out better than predicted</s>
<s>in june kkr agreed to sell a 45 stake in alliance boots a british pharmacy chain for $67 billion to walgreens which has the option to buy the rest in three years</s>
<s>if this happens kkr will make 22 times its money</s>
<s>kinder morgan a pipeline operator owned by carlyle and three others did an initial public offering ipo last year the owners may triple their money</s>
<s>even hilton a hotel chain bought by blackstone at the peak of the bubble could defy the doomsayers</s>
<s>the investment could be worth 25 times the initial value when hilton goes public</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are of course some carcasses</s>
<s>the 2007 leveraged buyout of archstone a property company by lehman brothers and tishman speyer was a disaster and is partly blamed for lehman’s demise</s>
<s>the biggest buyout in history is a spectacular failure txu a texan utility owned by kkr tpg and goldman sachs has suffered from a huge debt load and falling gas prices</s>
<s>the question is when not if it will file for bankruptcy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what determined whether these deals flew or flopped</s>
<s>companies in recessionresistant industries performed better</s>
<s>so did deals done before the peak of the bubble in 2007 says colin blaydon of dartmouth’s tuck school of business they were cheaper and had less debt</s>
<s>swift payouts were key too</s>
<s>blackstone sold most of equity office properties immediately after its 2007 buyout which helped it pay down debt</s>
<s>when possible privateequity firms piled on more debt to pay themselves early</s>
<s>by the time hca a healthcare firm went public in march 2011 its buyout owners had taken out nearly enough in dividends to recoup their investment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>low interest rates however are why most deals have avoided bankruptcy</s>
<s>privateequity firms have been able to refinance and yieldstarved investors have given some of these deals a second life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two boomera phenomena “covenantlite” debt and “payment in kind” loans also helped</s>
<s>the former made it hard for creditors to force the company into bankruptcy and the latter enabled firms to pay off creditors with new debt instead of cash</s>
<s>privateequity firms have managed to push back the “wall of debt” that critics thought would crush them this year or next</s>
<s>many do not see significant debt maturities until 2016 or later</s>
<s>with any luck they will already have offloaded their companies onto the public market by then</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>several companies have technically defaulted but restructured behind closed doors</s>
<s>txu caesars clear channel and freescale did “distressed exchanges” in which creditors accept losses in return for new debt</s>
<s>buyout firms also protected themselves by aggressively buying back bank debt at distressed prices when they could</s>
<s>creditors will be the ones to suffer most from private equity’s exuberance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>caveat investor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>amazingly most privateequity firms’ returns will be fine if the ipo market stabilises enough to list their companies</s>
<s>even kkr which invested in nine of the 20 largest buyouts and will have to write off its $2 billion investment in txu may see its 2006 fund make money</s>
<s>tpg which invested in seven of the 20 is one of the worst performers with exposure to txu caesars and freescale the latter two have lost 60 of their value</s>
<s>at the least tpg will probably return money to investors when the fund winds up</s>
<s>but that takes ten years a long wait for a small return</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how will privateequity firms have managed to turn a profit when they overleveraged and overpaid</s>
<s>typically they do not invest more than 10 of a fund in any one deal so diversification helped</s>
<s>so did perverse “deal” fees</s>
<s>buyout firms charge the firm they are acquiring around 12 of the deal for the privilege of being purchased</s>
<s>txu paid its sponsors $300m at acquisition and at least $35m a year to be managed and advised</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whereas privateequity firms may be toasting catastrophe averted investors have less to celebrate</s>
<s>most megadeals were done by “clubs” of firms so investors have multiple exposures to some of the worst deals</s>
<s>how the companies themselves will fare is a separate consideration</s>
<s>their debts may leave a lasting scar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>private equity’s reputation should be bruised a bit too</s>
<s>the techniques many firms used to keep their companies alive amount to little more than financial engineering says peter morris the author of “private equity public loss”</s>
<s>the industry’s boasts of value creation may look hollow at least for many of the megadeals</s>
