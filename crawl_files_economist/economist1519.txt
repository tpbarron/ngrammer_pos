<s>one evening in detroit in 1968 two music producers went to a dark and smoky bar</s>
<s>a man stood in the corner playing a guitar and singing his back to the crowd</s>
<s>named rodriguez this singer was an eccentric perhaps a drifter with a lyrical style similar to bob dylan’s but a mellower voice</s>
<s>the producers decided he deserved an album which led to two “cold fact” and “coming from reality”</s>
<s>but they both flopped and rodriguez disappeared back into the obscurity from which he had briefly emerged</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although rodriguez came to nothing in america some bootleg recordings made their way to south africa where their melancholic defiance touched a nerve among white liberal youths during the apartheid era</s>
<s>“every revolution needs an anthem” says craig bartholomewstrydom a journalist</s>
<s>“‘cold fact’ was south africa’s” rodriguez sold perhaps half a million albums in south africa where he was bigger than elvis</s>
<s>because the country was isolated by sanctions south africans had no idea that he was nothing anywhere else</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but some there noticed that they knew little about their hero</s>
<s>there were gruesome rumours about rodiguez’s death but not much else</s>
<s>so mr bartholomewstrydom and stephen segerman a jeweller set out to learn what had happened to him</s>
<s>their quest is the subject of “searching for sugar man” a documentary directed by malik bendjelloul</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the two men first tried to follow the money but that led to a dead end</s>
<s>indeed the fate of the proceeds from the record sales remains the film’s big unanswered question though the audience is left with its suspicions</s>
<s>but these amateur sleuths got a long way by other means and the story of their search and its consequences is weird and wonderful</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the film is in part about the power of music to travel and to inspire in unpredictable ways</s>
<s>it is also about the power of curiosity which can drive two guys to wander the world to find out about a man whose music they love</s>
<s>it is about the fulfilment of ambition but with a modesty and charm that feel especially good in an age of bankerly excess</s>
<s>and it is an elegy for a time before the internet before everyone instantly knew everything about everyone when the world was still full of mystery and surprise</s>
