<s>fold up those old stereotypes and put them in the cupboard two decades after the dust settled on communism “eastern europe” has come of age—and is ready to junk its outofdate label</s>
<s>in 2011 what was once the excommunist part of europe will no longer look any worse than or different from the luckier lands to the west of the old iron curtain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take politics</s>
<s>the old stereotype was that “east” european governments were unstable and chaotic</s>
<s>not any more</s>
<s>almost the longestserving prime minister in the european union next year will be andrus ansip of estonia in office since april 2005 hes beaten only by the eternal jeanclaude juncker of luxembourg and the embattled josé luis rodríguez zapatero of spain</s>
<s>polands donald tusk likely to win reelection in late 2011 will be that countrys longestserving prime minister since 1989 and another of the new breed of quietly impressive leaders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dump too the old stereotype about corruption it will be increasingly clear that the dividing line is northsouth not eastwest</s>
<s>estonia and slovenia already do better than spain italy or portugal in anticorruption rankings and almost all the “east europeans” do better than “west” european greece which is actually in the continents far southeast</s>
<s>the coming year will bring a crop of pleasing upgrades in league tables ranging from competitiveness to creditworthiness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>having been scared by the phantom danger of default and devaluation during the downturn investors are now reassessing their prejudices there will be booming investment and rising living standards in places like poland</s>
<s>estonia will join the euro zone at the start of 2011 bringing investors piling in whereas countries like greece will languish in the danger zone</s>

<s>the obama administration will hold the biggest military exercise so far in the baltic region in 2011 underlining its commitment to the security of poland and the alwaysjumpy baltic states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally forget the old notion of a region living in fear of russian energy cutoffs</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>so by the end of 2011 life in most of the newish eastern members of the eu will be a lot better and their prospects a lot brighter than ever before in their history</s>
<s>it will be time to find them a new name</s>
<s>how about the aces—the “advancing countries of europe”</s>
