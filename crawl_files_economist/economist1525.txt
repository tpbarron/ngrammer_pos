<s>binyamin netanyahu israel’s prime minister seems to have signalled that he will wait at least until after the american presidential election before deciding whether to bash iran’s nuclear facilities</s>
<s>he let it be known that he expects barack obama in return to toughen his line on iran by issuing something close to an ultimatum to the islamic republic that if it still refuses to curb its nuclear programme and provide for intrusive monitoring and verification the united states will take military action itself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>speculation had been mounting that mr netanyahu viewed the american preelection period as the best time to attack despite mr obama’s evident discouragement on the presumption that no candidate could be seen to condemn let alone abandon israel</s>
<s>mitt romney the republican candidate has accused mr obama of weakness towards iran and of “throwing allies like israel under the bus”</s>

<p>
<s>senior israeli military and intelligence officials past and present who oppose the notion of a unilateral israeli strike against iran made sure their views were leaked in the press</s>
<s>this in turn drew mutterings in mr netanyahu’s circle and in that of the defence minister ehud barak about people “covering their arses” and preparing for postwar commissions of inquiry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this strangely public controversy over the most secret of national decisions included a petition by authors and artists denying mr netanyahu’s right to decide whether to attack iran</s>
<s>nine members of his own parliamentary party then issued a counterpetition eagerly upholding his right and duty to do so</s>
<s>a senior former judge eliyahu winograd who headed an inquiry into israel’s war in lebanon in 2006 weighed in with a blistering broadcast swipe at messrs netanyahu and barak urging them not to “endanger the future of israel” and risk losing “everything we have built” by launching an attack</s>

<s>the strategic chatter has frightened a lot of israelis</s>
<s>behind a summery façade of relaxed spirits thousands of people queued anxiously at army distribution points to upgrade their gasmasks</s>
