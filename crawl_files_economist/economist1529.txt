<s>belonging to a political party has never been cheaper</s>
<s>it costs just €20 $25 a year to be a member of the socialist party in france</s>
<s>britain’s conservatives ask you to stump up only £25 $39</s>
<s>new political movements set you back even less £12 for membership of the pirate party uk or are more like social networks merely signing up online makes you a teaparty “member” in america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet despite such attractive prices europeans and americans are turning away in droves from affiliating with any one party</s>
<s>membership has been falling for many years but the decline seems to be accelerating and taking on a different quality</s>
<s>the factors that gave rise to mass parties are fading and unlikely to return as ingrid van biezen of leiden university and her colleagues argue in a recent paper ominously entitled “going going… gone”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>party membership has shrivelled in europe since the 1980s and at an especially fast rate in the first decade of this century</s>
<s>in roughly ten years up to 2008 party membership fell in germany by 20 in sweden by 27 and in norway by 29</s>
<s>in britain where the decline is even more pronounced at 36 the caravan club now has more members than all the political parties put together</s>
<s>not everywhere has seen the same trend parties remain strong in austria for instance</s>
<s>in italy membership has even bounced back somewhat thanks to newish parties such as the northern league</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in america where people can state a party preference when registering to vote the proportion of voters eschewing a party affiliation and calling themselves “independent” reached an average of 40 last year a record high</s>
<s>the share of independents usually drops in presidentialelection years but in may the figure touched 44—nine points more than at the same stage of the campaign in 2008 see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people have many reasons for falling out of love with parties</s>
<s>in a globalised and complex world more voters doubt that politicians can solve their problems</s>
<s>as individualism has grown stronger political tribalism has weakened</s>
<s>the decline of unions has hurt parties on the left</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but shifts in the media and in technology matter too</s>
<s>forty years ago political parties could still count on a mostly deferential media</s>
<s>now the internet lets multitudes of politicos thrive</s>
<s>many voters see better ways of making their voices heard than parties which russell dalton of the university of california at irvine terms “old technology”</s>
<s>blogging provides more interesting forums than ward meetings ever did</s>
<s>the internet also reduces the cost of asserting your political identity</s>
<s>why fill out forms and carry a party card when you can sign a petition online tweet and sport a wristband to show you care</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a parallel development is the rise of a new type of voter whom mr dalton terms “apartisan”</s>
<s>this is not just a new label for swing voters who respond like weathervanes to the gusts of policy that parties put out</s>
<s>rather explains mr dalton apartisans are “floating voters on steroids” they are young educated and vote at almost the same rate as partisans</s>
<s>they can be on the right or left</s>
<s>they are not interested in parties explaining their programmes to them</s>
<s>instead they try to get parties to adopt their views on issues they care about</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>singleissue pressure groups have always been a feature of politics but apartisan voters are now shaking up american elections</s>
<s>exhibit one is the tea party</s>
<s>but apartisan voters are present in european politics too accounting now for a fifth of the electorate in germany and switzerland</s>
<s>their voting preferences are very fluid in the 2009 german election half of apartisan voters said they settled on their vote only in the last week of the campaign</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite their declining membership the established parties are remarkably robust</s>
<s>americans elect a muchheralded internetbased project to find a thirdparty centrist presidential candidate to challenge the dominant two has flopped</s>
<s>newer and minor parties have done better in recent european elections but none has succeeded in winning power outright</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some say that the old parties could even stage a comeback—thanks to prolonged economic troubles</s>
<s>ms van biezen highlights what she calls the “repoliticisation” of parties</s>
<s>one example is in greece where syriza has transformed itself from a loose alliance of leftwing groups into the formal main antiausterity party</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is more likely that the decoupling of voters from political parties will continue</s>
<s>but how much does it matter</s>
<s>party leaders may not mind much</s>
<s>they will not have to listen to all those pesky members’ resolutions at party gatherings</s>
<s>and although it may be harder for a party to run a campaign with fewer volunteers it is not necessarily bad for governing argues mr dalton</s>
<s>politicians will give more weight to wider opinion outside the party</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even so there are drawbacks</s>
<s>without feepaying supporters parties will have to find financing elsewhere—which makes them more dependent on donations from vested interests</s>
<s>paul whiteley of the university of essex notes the increasing separation of political life from the rest of society</s>
<s>in the 1950s most britons would have known somebody who was a party member</s>
<s>now few do</s>
<s>ms van biezen thinks that as parties hollow out celebrity and dynastic politicians may become more prevalent</s>
<s>and a more fragmented political spectrum can make forming governments much harder</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the risk is that mass political parties despite being abandoned by many of their members will seem strong—until they quickly fall apart</s>
<s>history is littered with oncedominant institutions that were imperceptibly hollowed out and then suddenly collapsed</s>
<s>such a tipping point could be near particularly in europe</s>
<s>if so the landscape of western politics could suddenly look very unfamiliar</s>
