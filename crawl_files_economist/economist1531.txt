<s>if there is any endeavour whose fruits should be freely available that endeavour is surely publicly financed science</s>
<s>morally taxpayers who wish to should be able to read about it without further expense</s>
<s>and science advances through crossfertilisation between projects</s>
<s>barriers to that exchange slow it down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is a widespread feeling that the journal publishers who have mediated this exchange for the past century or more are becoming an impediment to it</s>
<s>one of the latest converts is the british government</s>
<s>on july 16th it announced that from 2013 the results of taxpayerfinanced research would be available free and online for anyone to read and redistribute</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>britain’s government is not alone</s>
<s>on july 17th the european union followed suit</s>
<s>it proposes making research paid for by its next scientificspending round—which runs from 2014 to 2020 and will hand out about €80 billion or $100 billion in grants—similarly easy to get hold of</s>
<s>in america the national institutes of health nih the singlebiggest source of civil research funds in the world has required openaccess publishing since 2008</s>
<s>and the wellcome trust a british foundation that is the world’s secondbiggest charitable source of scientific money after the bill and melinda gates foundation also insists that those who take its shilling make their work available free</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>criticism of journal publishers usually boils down to two things</s>
<s>one is that their processes take months when the internet could allow them to take days</s>
<s>the other is that because each paper is like a minimonopoly which workers in the field have to read if they are to advance their own research there is no incentive to keep the price down</s>
<s>the publishers thus have scientists—or more accurately their universities which pay the subscriptions—in an armlock</s>
<s>that combined with the fact that the raw material manuscripts of papers is free leads to generous returns</s>
<s>in 2011 elsevier a large dutch publisher made a profit of £768m on revenues of £206 billion—a margin of 37</s>
<s>indeed elsevier’s profits are thought so egregious by many people that 12000 researchers have signed up to a boycott of the company’s journals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a golden future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>publishers do provide a service</s>
<s>they organise peer review in which papers are criticised anonymously by experts though those experts like the authors of papers are rarely paid for what they do</s>
<s>and they sort the scientific sheep from the goats by deciding what gets published and where</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that gives the publishers huge power</s>
<s>since researchers administrators and grantawarding bodies all take note of which work has got through this filtering mechanism the competition to publish in the best journals is intense and the system becomes selfreinforcing increasing the value of those journals still further</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but not perhaps for much longer</s>
<s>support has been swelling for openaccess scientific publishing doing it online in a way that allows anyone to read papers free of charge</s>
<s>the movement started among scientists themselves but governments are now as britain’s announcement makes clear paying attention and asking whether they too might benefit from the change</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the british announcement followed the publication of a report by dame janet finch a sociologist at the university of manchester which recommends encouraging a business model adopted by one of the pioneers of openaccess publishing the public library of science</s>
<s>this organisation a charity based in san francisco charges authors a fee between $1350 and $2900 though it is waived in cases of hardship and then makes their papers available over the internet for nothing</s>
<s>for plos as the charity is widely known this works well</s>
<s>it has launched seven widely respected electronic journals since its foundation in 2000</s>
<s>for reasons lost in history this is known as the gold model</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the nih’s approach is different</s>
<s>it lets researchers publish in traditional journals but on condition that within a year they post their papers on a free “repository” website called pubmed</s>
<s>journals have to agree to this or be excluded from the process</s>
<s>this is known as the green model</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both gold and green models involve prepublication peer review</s>
<s>but a third does away with even that</s>
<s>many scientists physicists in particular now upload drafts of their papers into public archives paid for by networks of universities for the general good</s>
<s>the most popular is known as arxiv the middle letter being a greek chi</s>
<s> here manuscripts are subject to a ruthless process of open peer review rather than the secret sort traditional publishers employ</s>
<s>an arxived paper may end up in a traditional journal but that is merely to provide an imprimatur for the research team who wrote it</s>
<s>its actual publication and its value to other scientists dates from its original arrival online</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the success of plos and the political shift towards open access is encouraging other new ventures too</s>
<s>seeing the writing on the wall several commercial publishers are experimenting with goldmodel publishing</s>
<s>meanwhile later this year a coalition of the wellcome trust the max planck institute which runs many of germany’s leading laboratories and the howard hughes medical institute will publish the first edition of elife an openaccess journal with ambitions to rival the most famous journal of the lot nature</s>
<s>the deep pockets of these organisations mean that for the first few years at least this journal will not even require a publication fee</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>much remains to be worked out</s>
<s>some fear the loss of the traditional journals’ curation and verification of research</s>
<s>even sir mark walport the director of the wellcome trust and a fierce advocate of openaccess publication worries that a system based on the green model could become fragmented</s>
<s>that might happen if the newly liberated papers ended up in different places rather than being consolidated in the way the nih insists on</s>
<s>but research just published in bmc medicine an openaccess journal from springer suggests papers in openaccess journals are as widely cited as those in traditional publications</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a revolution then has begun</s>
<s>technology permits it researchers and politicians want it</s>
<s>if scientific publishers are not trembling in their boots they should be</s>
