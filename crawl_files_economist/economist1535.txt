<s>our big mac index is back</s>
<s>normally a beefy bundle of exchange rate fun this year it is marking a sombre anniversary five years since global moneymarkets seized up in the summer of 2007</s>
<s>what does burgernomics reveal about today’s exchange rates and about the impact that five years of distress from credit crunch to euro crisis have had on currencies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the big mac index is the economist’s burgerbased measure of whether currencies are over or undervalued</s>
<s>the recipe comes from the theory of purchasingpower parity which says that exchange rates should eventually adjust to make the price of a basket of goods the same in each country</s>
<s>our basket contains just one item the big mac hamburger which is pretty much the same around the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the index works by calculating the exchange rate that would leave a big mac costing the same in each country</s>
<s>take the rouble and the real the currencies of russia and brazil respectively</s>
<s>at current exchange rates a big mac which sells for $433 in america costs just $229 75 roubles in russia whereas in brazil it sells for a sliver under $5 10 reais</s>
<s>so the dollar buys a lot of burger in russia signalling that the rouble is cheap and the real rather pricey</s>
<s>a selection of other currencies is included in the chart the full index can be seen here</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition to the real several other currencies look dear according to the latest mcdata</s>
<s>a group of rich european countries—none of them in the euro zone—sit near the top of the pile</s>
<s>at the other end the yen the pound and the canadian dollar all look cheap</s>
<s>but it is in asia that you get the most burger for your buck china indonesia and hong kong are all more than 40 undervalued</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there have been some big shifts in fortune since the first rumblings of the crisis five years ago</s>
<s>the australian dollar has strengthened moving from 14 undervalued to 8 overvalued</s>
<s>in the early part of the crisis australia’s wellcapitalised banks proved remarkably resilient more recently the currency has benefited from a spike in commodities prices see article and from strong exports to china</s>
<s>japan and brazil also have beefier currencies than five years ago</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>others have weakened</s>
<s>the british pound is a shadow of its former self since 2007 it has moved from 18 overvalued to 4 undervalued</s>
<s>britain’s experience has been the opposite of australia’s its financial industry a big chunk of the overall economy was at the heart of the financial turmoil the pound depreciated sharply in 2008 and its biggest export market the euro zone is in a dreadful mess</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>being at the bottom of the big mac index need not be all bad though</s>
<s>a cheap currency means exports look attractive to foreigners</s>
<s>slipping down the index should in theory boost net exports</s>
<s>china manages its currency using exactly this logic to keep the yuan cheap and demand for yuanpriced exports high</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now the biggest exchange rate move economists are hoping to see is a marked fall in the value of the euro</s>
<s>the euro zone in particular its sickly peripheral economies including spain and greece craves a calorific boost from the currency</s>
