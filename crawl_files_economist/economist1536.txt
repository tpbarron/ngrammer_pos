<s>the deals “strategic and valuation rationale” declared victor koo to analysts on march 12th is to “establish a clear and dominant leadership in the online video sector in china”</s>
<s>it appears to do just that his company youku the countrys leading onlinevideo site is buying tudou the number two</s>
<s>but dominance is far from certain</s>
<s>neither firm has yet made a profit though stockmarkets in america where both are listed value the combination at $35 billion</s>
<s>the takeover is but a step towards the longforecast consolidation of a crowded industry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>demand for online video is growing quickly in china</s>
<s>many people particularly the young prefer the fare offered by youku and tudou from “prison break” to japanese anime to broadcast television—especially the dull fodder served up by cctv the state broadcaster</s>
<s>advertisers have begun to follow eyeballs paying onlinevideo companies nearly 17 billion yuan $268m in the fourth quarter of 2011 according to analysys international a research firm more than double the sum of a year before</s>
<s>youku with 263m monthly users snared 218 of that</s>
<s>tudou with 227m pulled in 137 other estimates give both firms higher market shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the trouble is that costs are also rising fast and that ad money plus a bit from subscriptions does not cover them</s>
<s>youku lost 172m yuan last year and tudou 511m yuan</s>
<s>the biggest drain is bandwidth for which onlinevideo companies must pay china telecom and china unicom the stateowned fixedline telecoms operators</s>
<s>next but growing much faster comes the cost of buying or making content</s>
<s>bidding wars have broken out youkus content costs trebled last year to 243m yuan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr koo expects the merged entity youku tudou of which youkus shareholders will own 715 to enjoy lower costs and higher revenues</s>
<s>both brands will be kept but will no longer bid against each other or presumably sue each other only last month it was reported that youku had sued tudou alleging copyright infringement</s>
<s>the sites will share content and redirect users to each other</s>
<s>they should also be able to drive harder bargains with advertisers—although keeping two sales and marketing teams will limit the gains</s>
<s>the companies believe that they can save $50m60m a year in costs they promise “significant” extra revenue too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bill bishop an analyst in beijing says that the deal is far from “game set and match” to youku and tudou</s>
<s>some lesser lights of online video are backed by giants of chinas internet such as baidu the dominant search engine and tencent the leading instantmessaging site</s>
<s>none seems ready to give up just yet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>duncan clark of bda an investmentadvisory firm in beijing says he is optimistic about the longterm prospects of onlinevideo companies because they give people something they clearly want</s>
<s>in the short term he is more cautious</s>
<s>bandwidth and content costs are one reason</s>
<s>regulation is another in the shape of sarft the film and broadcasting regulator which oversees the online firms too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>popular tv shows have been stopped before so why not online programmes as well if too few are watching the news on cctv</s>
<s>in china not only failure is risky</s>
