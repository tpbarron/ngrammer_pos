<s>a plaque at chickfila’s headquarters in atlanta says the company’s mission is to “glorify god” which it does by serving chickenburgers and closing its 1600 outlets on sundays</s>
<s>the founder truett cathy once said that while “you don’t have to be a christian to work at chickfila…we ask you to base your business on biblical principles because they work”</s>

<s>his son dan the fastfood chain’s current boss is also devout so it should have surprised no one when he told a christian news organisation that he disapproved of gay marriage</s>
<s>yet the reaction was swift and strident</s>
<s>gayrights groups called for protests and boycotts see picture</s>
<s>on august 3rd gay couples planned to stage a “kissin” at selected chickfila outlets</s>
<s>the mayors of chicago boston and san francisco all declared chickfila unwelcome in their cities—not because the firm refuses to hire or serve gays but because its boss expressed an opinion that irks them</s>

<s>such dustups are not common but they can hurt a business badly</s>
<s>chickfila could sue if a city actually blocked a restaurant because of its boss’s religious views</s>

<s>so here are the economist’s tips on how companies can avoid causing offence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first dont discuss religion in public</s>
<s>few people will buy your margarine just because you are zoroastrian</s>
<s>plenty may shun it if you loudly espouse dogma they find disagreeable</s>
<s>this tip applies doubly to global firms which must serve customers of every faith and none</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second if you must discuss religion in public keep it bland and woolly</s>
<s>zhang xin one of chinas biggest property developers is a devoted bahai</s>
<s>however when she frets aloud about whether her country has lost its moral moorings she does so in nonreligious or at most broadly spiritual language</s>
<s>such circumspection is the norm for public figures in china</s>
<s>the chinese government is deeply suspicious of religion and professions of faith are not a regular part of public discourse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third remember that something which seems trivial to you may be weighty for others</s>
<s>in early 2001 several executives of ajinomoto a japanese company that produces monosodium glutamate a flavour enhancer were arrested in indonesia and charged with breaking the countrys consumerprotection laws</s>
<s>their mistake and ajinomotos was to use a porkderived enzyme to produce their seasoning which had been labelled halal or permissible for muslims to eat</s>
<s>ajinomoto switched to a soybased enzyme but not soon enough its shares plummeted and it had to recall thousands of tonnes of its products from indonesian shelves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally ride out brouhahas over which you have no control</s>
<s>in the early 2000s as the second intifada raged in israel and palestine a group of egyptians urged arab consumers to boycott ariel soap powder</s>
<s>it was named they claimed after ariel sharon then israels prime minister and its logo was a cleverly disguised star of david</s>
<s>procter  gamble the american multinational that makes ariel pointed out that the soap predated mr sharons tenure in office it was launched in 1967 when he was still majorgeneral sharon and that the logo represented an atom not a religious symbol</s>
<s>still sales suffered as did those of many other american products in the arab world</s>
<s>danish goods endured the same fate a few years later after a newspaper in denmark published cartoons of the prophet that upset many muslims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>out of such sentiments came a brief flowering of explicitly muslim enterprise hero chips its bag depicting a young boy about to hurl a stone at an israeli tank and abu ammar chips named after yasser arafats nom de guerre in palestine mecca cola and muslimup in france qibla cola in britain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for chickfila it will cope</s>
<s>christians hate to see their coreligionists persecuted</s>
<s>some christian leaders are urging their followers to affirm a business that operates on christian principles by eating chickfilas delicious sarnies</s>
