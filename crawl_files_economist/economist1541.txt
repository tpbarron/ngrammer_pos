<s>asked where they would like to spend their last days americans almost always say at home surrounded by people they love</s>
<s>in real life though only one in five achieves that</s>
<s>more than 30 die in a nursing home where almost no one wants to be and over half end up in a hospital often in an intensivecare unit heavily sedated and attached to lifesaving equipment until their doctors give up the battle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>death is a difficult subject for anyone but americans want to talk about it less than most</s>
<s>they have a cultural expectation that whatever may be wrong with them it can be fixed with the right treatment and if the first doctor does not offer it they may seek a second third or fourth opinion</s>
<s>litigation is a constant threat so even if a patient is very ill and likely to die doctors and hospitals will still persist with aggressive treatment paid for by the insurer or for the elderly by medicare</s>
<s>that is one reason why america spends 18 of its gdp on health care the highest proportion in the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that does not mean that americans are getting the worlds best health care</s>
<s>for the past 20 years doctors at the dartmouth institute for health policy and clinical practice in new hampshire have been compiling the “dartmouth atlas of health care” using medicare data to compare healthspending patterns in different regions and institutions</s>
<s>they find that average costs per patient during the last two years of life when health spending is heaviest in some regions can be almost twice as high as in others yet patients in the highspending areas do not survive any longer or enjoy better health as a result</s>

<s>ira byock is the director of palliative medicine at dartmouthhitchcock medical centre and a professor at dartmouth medical school</s>
<s>his book is a plea for those near the end of their life to be treated more like individuals and less like medical cases on which all available technology must be let loose</s>
<s>with two decades experience in the field he makes a good case for sometimes leaving well alone and helping people to die gently if that is what they want</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that does not include assisted suicide which he opposes</s>
<s>but it does include providing enough pain relief to make patients comfortable coordinating their treatment among the different specialists keeping them informed having enough staff on hand to see to their needs making arrangements for them to be cared for at home where possible—and not officiously keeping them alive when there is no hope</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is slippery territory</s>
<s>the medicare hospice benefit act passed by congress 30 years ago offers palliative care to those expected to die within six months but requires that once they take it up treatment for their condition must stop</s>
<s>that puts many patients off</s>
<s>and when they hear “palliative care” and “hospice” their usual reaction is “im not that far gone yet” yet hospice patients typically last only two or three weeks</s>
<s>as dr byock says this has become “brinkofdeath care”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nor is it easy to decide when to stop making every effort to save someones life and allow them to die gently</s>
<s>the book quotes the case of one hivpositive young man who was acutely ill with multiple infections</s>
<s>he spent over four months in hospital much of the time on a ventilator and had countless tests scans and other interventions</s>
<s>the total bill came to over $1m</s>
<s>he came close to death many times but eventually pulled through and has now returned to a normal life</s>
<s>it is an uplifting story but such an outcome is very rare</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr byocks writing style is not everybodys cup of tea</s>
<s>the patients personal stories are told in minute detail leaving the reader gagging at the degree of physical and psychological suffering that is most peoples lot towards the end of their lives</s>
<s>and the author gets rather messianic advocating a more caring society that shows no sign of materialising</s>
<s>but he is surely right to suggest better management of a problem that can only get worse</s>
<s>as life expectancy keeps on rising so will the proportion of old people in the population</s>
<s>and with 75m american babyboomers now on the threshold of retirement there is a limit to what the country can afford to spend to keep them going on and on</s>
