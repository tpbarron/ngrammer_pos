<s>peer steinbrÜck is a rare german politician in that his sense of irony delivered in the staccato hanseatic dialect of his native hamburg is sharp even hilarious</s>
<s>his favourite animal is the rhinoceros and rhetorically he charges ahead in much the same way</s>
<s>his main hobby is chess at which he seems to excel</s>
<s>in sheer intellect he can match angela merkel germany’s chancellor whom mr steinbrück will challenge in next year’s parliamentary election</s>
<s>“it won’t be a boring campaign” mr steinbrück promised wryly on october 1st after the leaders of the social democratic party spd nominated him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that nomination did not go quite as planned</s>
<s>the election is still a year away and the spd wanted to spare its candidate a prolonged grilling</s>
<s>so its chairman sigmar gabriel had designed an elaborate theatre to keep the candidacy open until january</s>
<s>he himself was one option mr steinbrück the second and frankwalter steinmeier the spd’s parliamentary leader the third</s>
<s>privately messrs gabriel and steinmeier admitted they did not want the job</s>
<s>when this leaked out mr steinbrück had to be crowned in a hurry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reluctance of the other two is understandable</s>
<s>germans think mrs merkel has had a good euro crisis—according to polls voters view her as dependable—and she remains hugely favoured to win reelection</s>
<s>mr gabriel the youngest of the spd’s triumvirate at 53 may have concluded that he should wait for better odds another day</s>
<s>mr steinmeier who already challenged mrs merkel in 2009 and lost is seen as a softy and did not want to go through the circus again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr steinbrück was in his late 50s by the time he led his party in a big election for the first time in northrhine westphalia where he was premier</s>
<s>he lost that election</s>
<s>he then ended up in mrs merkel’s own government as her finance minister in 200509 during the grand coalition between mrs merkel’s christian democrats cdu and the spd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they made a good pair</s>
<s>one memorable moment was october 5th 2008 in the first throes of the financial crisis</s>
<s>a bank run seemed imminent and mrs merkel and mr steinbrück appeared together to assure savers that their money was safe</s>
<s>they genuinely respect each other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now of course they will fight a battle of wits which mrs merkel also has in abundance but displays less readily in public</s>
<s>philosophically their differences are smaller than they might admit</s>
<s>mrs merkel poaches issues from the centreleft parties where she can</s>
<s>mr steinbrück is on the right of his erstwhile socialist party</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wooing its left wing is mr steinbrück’s first task</s>
<s>he is hoping that railing against banks will suffice</s>
<s>this week he begged the lefties for “leg room” which he specified at 180cm bringing the house down</s>
<s>publicly he insists that he wants to form a government only in coalition with the greens but he knows that the most likely result arithmetically is another grand coalition with the cdu</s>
<s>if that happens he may bow out of politics for he has ruled out serving under mrs merkel again</s>
