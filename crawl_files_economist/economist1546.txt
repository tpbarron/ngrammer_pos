<s>in 2012 the worlds leadership will be reshuffled</s>
<s>the united states france and russia will all hold presidential elections—and the top leaders of china will also change after a communist party congress that will probably take place in october</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a result for much of the year four of the five permanent members of the un security council will be consumed by internal politics</s>
<s>that in turn will profoundly affect international relations</s>
<s>as political leaders play to their domestic galleries they will surely take more nationalist and parochial positions on the big international issues</s>
<s>that is worrying because 2012 will be a year demanding intense international cooperation to cope with a deteriorating economic climate</s>
<s>the result could be serious damage to the underpinnings of globalisation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of all the potential changes in leadership the american presidentialelection campaign will loom largest—both because america is still the worlds sole superpower and because the vote does not take place until november</s>
<s>president barack obamas immersion in the electoral campaign will make it all but impossible for america to sign new international agreements on trade or the climate</s>
<s>but mr obama may also face a republican opponent who will challenge americas traditional role as a guarantor of the world trading system</s>
<s>mitt romney one of the frontrunners for the republican nomination and a man with a business background has said that as president he would impose tariffs on chinese goods if china refuses to let its currency float though presidential candidates have a history of being tougher on china during the campaign than they turn out to be in office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a harder line from america will be more than matched by a surge of tough nationalistic talk from china—which will also be a reflection of the countrys internal politics</s>
<s>for all the differences between america and china the obama white house has come to trust the two men currently at the top of chinese politics president hu jintao and the prime minister wen jiabao</s>
<s>by the end of 2012 however they will almost certainly be handing over to president xi jinping and li keqiang as prime minister</s>
<s>both men have presented a fairly bland and inscrutable face to the world</s>
<s>but some 70 of chinas top leadership is likely to change during 2012 and western officials are nervous that more nationalist voices are rising up the hierarchy</s>
<s>bo xilai currently the party chief in chongqing has a taste for maoist slogans as well as designer suits</s>
<s>he is tipped for high office and is known to advocate a tough line with criminals and foreigners</s>

<s>prepare for a period of putinism</s>

<p>
<s>with the future of the euro at the centre of international economic discussions the tenor of european politics and the french presidential election will matter a lot to the rest of the world</s>
<s>of all the leaders who are up for reelection nicolas sarkozy the president of france is probably the one who is most in danger of losing his job</s>
<s>long before the election the second round will take place on may 6th mr sarkozy was trailing all plausible challengers from the socialist party in the opinion polls</s>
<s>the european economic crisis could give mr sarkozy an appealing opportunity to play the international statesman during the presidential campaign</s>
<s>but it may also tempt him to indulge his populist side</s>
<s>in the past he has taken positions that pander to french alarm about international trade and immigration—talking of the need for higher tariff barriers to protect eu goods and for tougher border controls and the deportation of illegal immigrants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr sarkozys opponents will contribute to the ­nationalist tenor of the debate</s>
<s>marine le pen of the farright national front can be counted on to bang the drum against immigration and free trade</s>
<s>and many socialists have deep reservations about globalisation</s>
<s>all in all the french presidential election is unlikely to make it easier to take difficult decisions on the future of europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>vladimir putin will return as russian president when his country goes to the polls in march giving international politics another nationalist twist</s>
<s>dmitry medvedev the current president is mr putins protégé</s>
<s>but his foreign policy has been less confrontational towards the united states and the eu than mr putins in both style and substance</s>
<s>for example mr medvedev took a neutral stance on the western intervention in libya whereas mr putin as prime minister was opposed</s>
<s>mr medvedev has made it clear that he believes in international cooperation and has worked well with america on the effort to reset russianamerican relations</s>
<s>mr putin is much more prickly and suspicious and tends to regard international politics as a zerosum competition between nations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately in 2012 it is mr putins way of looking at international relations that will gain ground across the world</s>
