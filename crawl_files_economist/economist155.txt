<s>hollywood has long had a fascination with the little guy who battles to expose illegal or unethical behaviour by big corporations from the nuclear industry “the china syndrome” “silkwood” to pharmaceuticals “the constant gardener” and tobacco “the insider”</s>
<s>more recent releases include “the whistleblower” in which rachel weisz outs human trafficking by a united nations contractor and “chasing madoff” a documentary on harry markopoloss efforts to alert the world to bernie madoffs ponzi scheme</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the real world the whistleblowers plight is decidedly unhollywoodlike</s>
<s>exposing wrongdoing at powerful companies is hugely stressful</s>
<s>employers denounce those who do as snitches or cranks</s>
<s>it is easy to descend into paranoia or selfdoubt</s>
<s>mr markopolos still beats himself up wondering what he might have done differently to expose mr madoff sooner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>life will get a bit easier and a lot more lucrative for fraudbusters in 2012</s>
<s>countries around the world will further strengthen protections for whistleblowers</s>
<s>and the monetary incentives to come forward will grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thank the global financial crisis</s>
<s>governments in a fiscal pickle after bailing out their banks will devote more effort to stamping out the types of fraud that pillage the public purse in medicare say or military procurement</s>
<s>financial regulators having failed abysmally to root out wrongdoing before 2008 will increasingly look to outsource policing to corporate sleuths and insiders who are closer to the action</s>
<s>tips are by far the leading source of fraud detection see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this will be most apparent in america</s>
<s>the doddfrank act passed after the crisis offers whistleblowers strong protections from retaliation and bounties of up to 30 of awards resulting from their tipoffs</s>
<s>the measures which went into effect in august “could be a gamechanger because they turn everyone into a potential whistleblower” says gary aguirre who exposed the soft treatment by the securities and exchange commission sec of wall street bigwigs in an insidertrading case</s>
<s>all the sec which will administer the programme has to do is “be patient enough to listen” he adds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new incentives should encourage more of those who uncover wrongdoing to step forward greatly reducing the number who tell nobody for fear of reprisals from their employer 3040 according to one study</s>
<s>they will receive help from a fastgrowing cottage industry of whistleblower lawyers advocacy groups such as americas national whistleblowers centre nwc and documentpublishers</s>
<s>anticipating a bonanza tort lawyers have begun to switch from other practice areas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>celebrated whistleblowers too will become stronger pillars of the supporting infrastructure</s>
<s>since the madoff affair mr markopolos has coaxed disaffected insiders into bringing allegations of pricegouging against banks that trade foreign exchange</s>
<s>he wants to make a career of “digging up skeletons one at a time”</s>
<s>mr aguirre a lawyer has nurtured among others an sec insider who wanted to publicise the agencys shredding of documents relating to closed investigations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all of which suggests that 2012 will be a bumper year for fraud detectives</s>
<s>payouts are not new to be sure some $3 billion has been distributed to whistleblowers since 1987 under americas false claims act which covers government contractors</s>
<s>but expect the number of bounties in the tens or even hundreds of millions to jump</s>
<s>financial services will be fertile territory given the temptation for stressed firms to cook the books</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some corporate executives squeal that the new rules will produce waves of frivolous claims by golddiggers</s>
<s>but the evidence so far suggests that the quality of tips has gone up not down</s>
<s>deep down bosses know there is no going back</s>
<s>the costs of overhauling internalcompliance procedures will grow sharply in 2012 as many discover how inadequate existing systems are</s>
<s>big companies will begin to offer what gregory keating of littler mendelson an employmentlaw firm calls “mini doddfranks” extra bounties for employees who report their concerns internally before approaching regulators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what worries chief executives most is the global reach of americas new rules</s>
<s>doddfrank mandates payments for whistleblowers whose tips lead to penalties under the foreign corrupt practices act</s>
<s>this applies to companies based anywhere so long as their securities are traded in america even if the corruption took place overseas and the whistleblower is a foreign national</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this marks a “powerful turningpoint in trans­national whistleblowing” says stephen kohn of the nwc</s>
<s>“for the first time whistleblowers from countries with weak democratic institutions can come to america to get due process” such cases are likely to proliferate in 2012</s>
<s>as a result multinationals will grow warier of operating in countries where they have to pay to play</s>
<s>meanwhile whistleblowers will continue to face harassment in countries that insist on viewing them as a national embarrassment</s>
<s>and everywhere bounty hunters will still need a thick skin and plenty of patience</s>
