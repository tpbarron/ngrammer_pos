<s>fans of charter cities—the idea of planting internationally run exclaves in poor countries—are downcast</s>
<s>the leading intellectual backer of their most promising venture has pulled out amid a row about transparency</s>
<s>on september 4th michael strong an american activist and entrepreneur signed a preliminary deal for a small project in honduras</s>
<s>that outmanoeuvred paul romer an economics professor at new york university who had backed a bigger one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr romer’s plan featured a transparency commission a quasijudicial check on the city’s administrators</s>
<s>charter cities aim to replicate the success of places like colonialera hong kong offering a businessfriendly regime but without direct democratic oversight</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the honduras government agreed in december to set up the transparency commission it included george akerlof an economist and ong boon hwee a former senior executive at singapore power</s>
<s>but it has yet to publish a decree to give the body legal clout</s>
<s>mr romer deplores what he calls “an overt act of deception”</s>
<s>in the meantime mr strong has struck his own deal for a “less farfetched” project that aims to create jobs and cheap housing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr romer’s enthusiasm is undimmed</s>
<s>he says it will take several tries before a project succeeds</s>
<s>but the sort of places that most need charter cities may also be where founding them is trickiest</s>
