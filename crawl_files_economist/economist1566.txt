<s>in berlin they still talk about angela and vladimir’s dog</s>
<s>when chancellor angela merkel paid one of her visits to russia her team reminded the russians that she disliked dogs</s>
<s>yet when she arrived vladimir putin at the time russia’s prime minister now again president kept her waiting and put his black labrador by her chair</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is characteristic of mrs merkel that she does not let personal gestures ruin diplomacy</s>
<s>as a former east german and daughter of a pastor she must have private doubts about mr putin who ended his kgb career in dresden</s>
<s>but she suppresses them more than joachim gauck germany’s president also a former east german and a pastor</s>
<s>for mrs merkel the bilateral relationship was a mostly unemotional affair about buying gas from russia while selling german machines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet that has changed as will once again be apparent when she meets mr putin in moscow for the petersburg dialogue next week</s>
<s>this forum set up in 2001 during the schröderputin days is designed for frank exchanges between businessmen academics and policymakers</s>
<s>one of the germans travelling with mrs merkel is andreas schockenhoff who will chair the working group on “civil society”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr schockenhoff’s presence will irritate mr putin</s>
<s>he is not only a parliamentary leader of the christian democrats mrs merkel’s party but also her special envoy for nongovernmental russogerman relations</s>
<s>since mr putin became president again in may mr schockenhoff has attacked his crackdown on civil society</s>
<s>he has criticised mr putin’s harassment of charities and campaigning groups new laws against demonstrations and free speech and the jailing of two women from pussy riot a punk group that staged a protest in moscow’s main cathedral</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr schockenhoff says the russian foreign ministry complained when he criticised mr putin by name</s>
<s>then the foreign ministry became “very very angry”</s>
<s>nonetheless he drafted a position paper for parliament</s>
<s>germany’s foreign ministry then intervened which mr schockenhoff found “unusual” as successive drafts went back and forth</s>
<s>last month the russians accused mr schockenhoff of making “defamatory” remarks about mr putin and suggested that they would no longer recognise his authority to speak for the government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>germany could have ignored this comment but surprisingly chose not to</s>
<s>steffen seibert mrs merkel’s spokesman said the russian criticism “astonished us” and reminded russia that it was up to the government to decide who spoke for it</s>
<s>mrs merkel may at last have shown her true colours—even if germany’s influential prorussia business lobby is at pains to play that impression down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>alexander rahr a leading russophile and author of a biography of mr putin says germany’s russia policy has for decades oscillated between realpolitik and values and that the current spat is nothing new</s>
<s>the russians he says have no equivalent of mr schockenhoff’s function</s>
<s>germany “must not lose patience must not lose russia” he advises adding that wandel durch handel change through trade is a better course</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet ulrich speck a foreignpolicy analyst in heidelberg is not so sure</s>
<s>he thinks germany should make more effort to promote liberal values in the world and particularly in russia</s>
<s>the germans have more clout than they realise</s>
<s>“economically we are a giant and they are the dwarf” he says</s>
<s>germany has already refocused its eastern priorities towards poland a far larger trading partner</s>
<s>mrs merkel recently visited moldova a country russia has long bullied</s>
<s>and germany is part of nato’s “steadfast jazz” exercises next year defending poland and the baltic states against supposed russian aggression</s>
<s>the harder line against mr putin may endure</s>
