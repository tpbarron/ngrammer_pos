<s>the spike in violence “has us worried” says alejandro martínez president of the colombian petroleum association which groups together private oil companies operating in the country</s>

<s>several things lie behind the oil boom</s>
<s>to attract investment the governments of Álvaro uribe colombias president from 2002 to 2010 licensed large areas of the country for exploration and offered tax breaks</s>
<s>private firms were no longer required to form partnerships with ecopetrol the state oil company</s>
<s>and the government sold shares in ecopetrol allowing it to increase its capital spending fourfold since 2007</s>
<s>at the same time colombia benefited from the improvement in security and the hostility of venezuela ecuador bolivia and argentina to foreign investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in all foreign direct investment in the oil industry jumped from $278m in 2003 to $43 billion in 2011 according to the central bank</s>
<s>many of the new investors are startups listed in canada but run by technicians sacked from pdvsa venezuelas state oil company by hugo chávez after a strike in 2003</s>
<s>though some new fields are in caquetá and putumayo where few foreign firms dared venture before most of the extra output comes from using new technology to increase recovery at old wells</s>
<s>production at the rubiales field discovered in 1981 has risen from 8000 bd in 2007 to 165000 last year</s>

<p>
<s>the spate of attacks on oil installations however meant that output fell short of the governments forecast of 1m bd by the end of last year</s>
<s>reaching the target of 15m bd by 2015 will require continuing pressure on the guerrillas</s>

<p>
<s>the violence is in part a reaction to a reform of royalties by juan manuel santos mr uribes successor</s>
<s>most used to go to mayors in oil areas and were often stolen by guerrillas or paramilitaries</s>
<s>royalties now go to the central government which hands them out according to stricter criteria</s>
<s>so the gunmen have switched to extorting from oil companies rather than mayors</s>
<s>that too looks like a problem of success—but one that needs to be fixed</s>
