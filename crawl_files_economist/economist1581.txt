<s>careers in sports tend to be short and most professional athletes hope to earn enough during their playing days to enjoy a long and comfortable retirement</s>
<s>human ones that is</s>
<s>for the equine athletes the big bucks start when the racing stops</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on october 20th frankel a fouryearold bay thoroughbred won his 14th and final race</s>
<s>timeform a handicapper has given him its highest rating ever</s>
<s>during his undefeated career frankel earned £3m $48m for his owner khalid abdullah a saudi prince</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he could make the same amount in just a few months once he is sent to stud</s>
<s>a typical stallion can mate with 100150 mares a year for a decade and mr abdullah is expected to charge at least £100000 for frankel’s services</s>
<s>if his foals perform well once they start racing in 2016 that amount could triple</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the surface £100000 might sound like a bargain</s>
<s>promising yearlings horses aged one to two sell for some £500000 and an owner could earn back that sum by winning two of the highstakes races at royal ascot</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however paying for upkeep and jockeys does not come cheap</s>
<s>and good genes are no guarantee of success</s>
<s>just 59 of frankel’s 218 halfsiblings who have raced have earned back the £120000 stud fee charged by their sire galileo 20 failed to win anything</s>
<s>high chaparral a stallion who shares an owner with galileo proved better value</s>
<s>his foals have earned an average of £167000—only slightly less than the £179000 won by an average offspring of galileo—and his services can be had for a mere £20000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nonetheless few owners of top racehorses are in it for the money</s>
<s>many will pay up just to boast of their animals’ bloodlines</s>
<s>frankel “is a collector’s item like a rare work of art” says johnny mckeever the owner of a breeding agency</s>
<s>and even if his offspring fail to replicate his success they can always be sent to stud themselves to help earn back their cost</s>
