<s>peter conradi first became interested in thompson while researching his acclaimed biography of iris murdoch</s>
<s>the two had been contemporaries at oxford the year before the war</s>
<s>thompson fell in love with the future novelist and with communism in the same week “two flights of irrationality…two simultaneous conversion experiences” their love could never be fulfilled</s>
<s>but for murdoch “frank grew to combine the roles of heroic martyr potential husband and lost soulmate” he was both brilliant and warmhearted</s>

<s>mr conradi tells the true story movingly and well</s>
<s>he admits that thompson was never more than an apprentice poet though his best poem “an epitaph for my friends” is perhaps the landmark poem of the war and he convincingly portrays an attractive brilliant and courageous personality an intellectual with a heart who loved laughter an idealist who merits the title of this book</s>
