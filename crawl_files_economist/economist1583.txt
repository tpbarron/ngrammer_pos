<s>in the decade to 2007 around 15m latin americans moved to spain in search of a better life—over 300000 of them in 2007 itself</s>
<s>now with spain in trouble and many latin american economies growing fast the tide has turned see chart</s>
<s>spanish local records show that around 20000 colombians and 40000 ecuadoreans left the country in 2011 many to seek their fortunes at home</s>

<s>typical of the trend is gerardo navarro</s>
<s>he moved to spain in 2007 hoping to find work in its building trade which had been booming</s>
<s>but when the property bubble burst mr navarro found himself without a job</s>
<s>rather than compete for the limited scraps of work in spain mr navarro returned to colombia where a surge in construction in bogotá has opened up opportunities</s>

<s>highly educated latin americans are in the same boat</s>
<s>after going to university in barcelona luis saucedo from tamaulipas mexico thought it would be easy to find a job</s>
<s>but with spain’s banks shrinking mr saucedo moved to london and worked as a waiter</s>
<s>now he plans to return home where a growing financial industry is keen to recruit new staff</s>
<s>he has applied for a job at the mexican subsidiary of spain’s banco santander</s>

<p>
<s>returning latin americans are being joined by spaniards</s>
<s>nearly 20000 of them moved to latin america last year up from just 3700 in 2005</s>
<s>the spaniards who are leaving the country tend to be both young and educated</s>
<s>although around 40 of spaniards end up with a university degree many struggle to find employment at home</s>
<s>but their skills are in demand in latin america where a degree from a european university is seen as prestigious although spanish universities fare poorly in international rankings</s>

<p>
<s>spain has long sought to curb immigration from its former colonies</s>
<s>now that the reverse is beginning to happen perceptions are switching too</s>
<s>latin americans no longer see spain as the place of opportunity it once was</s>
<s>increasingly they see opportunities at home</s>
