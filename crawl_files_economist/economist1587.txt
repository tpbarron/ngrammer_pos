<s>forget checking the olympic medal count every day</s>
<s>a better way to see how nations stack up is to calculate how many athletes countries had to enrol to win a medal</s>
<s>east germany bet on a combination of state intervention talent and dubious training regimesâ€”and still tops the list although china is catching up fast</s>
<s>ethiopia benefits from specialisation all its 38 medals have come on the track and at distances of 3000m or longer</s>
<s>see the results for the rest of the world</s>
