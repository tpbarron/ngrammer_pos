<s>after the financial crisis struck bold political choices to shore up banks and embrace stimulus staved off a depression and underwrote the recovery</s>
<s>in 2011 politicians will again play a pivotal role</s>
<s>but this time the risk is that they will do damage with blunt fiscal austerity and currency wars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>budget cuts are top of the agenda across the rich world</s>
<s>even though the recovery is sluggish see article rich economies are planning spending cuts and tax increases worth just over 1 of their joint gdp in 2011 the biggest collective dose of deficitcutting on record</s>
<s>these economies will begin the year with on average deficits above 8 of gdp and gross public debt over 100 of gdp—up by a third since 2007</s>
<s>sovereign borrowing is rising at its fastest pace in modern history even as health and pension pledges to ageing populations promise more red ink ahead</s>
<s>the battering suffered by greece and ireland has shown the painful consequences if bond markets lose confidence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>clearly something must be done</s>
<s>but that something should not be austerity at any price</s>
<s>governments need to lay out a credible path to reducing their deficits in the medium term but without excessively enfeebling an already weak recovery</s>
<s>that means raising retirement ages and overhauling pensions putting in place the budget rules and institutions that will curb future profligacy and favouring spending cuts over tax increases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately the tea leaves do not look good</s>
<s>americas 2011 fiscal stance will be one of stalemate</s>
<s>there will be no progress on solving the countrys mediumterm budget mess even as concerns about the deficit forestall any shortterm measures to boost employment or prop up demand</s>
<s>fiscal policy will tighten by default as barack obamas stimulus package winds down as states raise taxes and cut spending and—if the white house has its way—as george bushs tax cuts expire for households making more than $250000 a year</s>

<p>
<s>europes budget plans are better designed countries from france to greece are raising retirement ages others from britain to germany have created new organisations and rules to encourage fiscal probity</s>
<s>but europe risks overkill</s>
<s>the pace of deficitreduction in 2011 will be too fast particularly in britain and spain</s>
<s>european policymakers will put in place unworkable new strictures on indebted members of the euro zone</s>
<s>too many europeans believe that budget tightening will boost growth even in the short term 2011 will prove them wrong</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the collective budgetcutting will sap the recovery</s>
<s>different combinations of fiscal austerity and monetary activism will bring turbulence to currency markets and will make likelier 2011s second policy mistake an escalation of currency intervention in both the rich and especially the emerging world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china may allow the yuan to wriggle upward but not far</s>
<s>faced with a flood of capital searching for higher yields other emerging economies from brazil to korea will build up eyepopping reserves rather than let their currencies soar</s>
<s>several emerging economies will reintroduce or strengthen controls on capital inflows</s>
<s>all these interventions will fuel trade tensions as countries accuse each other of trying to steal a march at others expense</s>
<s>the main animosity will be between america and china</s>
<s>congress will finally pass legislation that declares chinas currency an illicit subsidy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wanted a growth strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if these selfinflicted wounds are avoided the narrow focus on austerity has another downside</s>
<s>it will divert attention from the broader reforms that rich countries need</s>
<s>the todo list for 2011 varies</s>
<s>many european countries and japan need to free their labour markets and liberalise services to boost productivity growth</s>
<s>america should do more to fix the stillfestering housing crisis and overhaul its training schemes so that high joblessness does not become entrenched</s>
<s>hunkering down for austerity is not enough</s>
<s>the rich world needs a strategy for growth</s>
