<s>european foreign policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sir – charlemagne criticised european union foreign policy as needing “to do more than respond to every problem with fresh sanctions” march 3rd</s>
<s>but he overlooked the challenges of shaping a foreign policy for the 27 member states as well as the function that economic sanctions have in the overall eu toolkit</s>
<s>the first thing to realise is how much the lisbon treaty altered foreign policy from 2009 onwards</s>
<s>it created the external action service which is the eus diplomatic corps established at its head the post of high representative for foreign affairs and abolished the merrygoround of foreignpolicymaking by eu presidencies that formed new sets of priorities every six months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moving forward it is crucial that we identify areas where the eu is stronger if it engages at 27 and where the only way to achieve results is to act together</s>
<s>such areas include the middle east peace process dealing with irans nuclear programme and promoting reform among the eus southern and eastern neighbours</s>
<s>the list of priorities includes countries where we have to use both carrots and sticks to change behaviour isolate regimes or promote reforms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the eu is increasingly as charlemagne noted using sanctions not just the economic kind but a whole range of measures from arms embargoes to visa bans</s>
<s>it is popular to decry sanctions but they have proven effective when used in conjunction with other tools</s>
<s>look at iran where tough eu sanctions helped bring tehran back to the negotiating table</s>
<s>or myanmar where sanctions showed the government that longterm isolation was undesirable</s>
<s>or côte divoire where eu sanctions helped force laurent gbagbo from power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but although the lisbon treaty changed the eu it is equally important to see what did not change</s>
<s>eu foreign policy remains the business of its member states so any progress can only be achieved if there is consensus</s>
<s>the idea that the high representative for foreign affairs can forge her own foreign policy against the will of member states is unrealistic</s>
<s>she can prod push and pull as she often does but she cannot charge ahead without the backing of the 27</s>

<s>sir – i was astonished to see you repeat david camerons incorrect assertion about the work experience scheme that “half of those participating found paid work soon after finishing the scheme” “can work wont work” march 3rd</s>
<s>about half of the participants stopped claiming benefits but this does not mean that they found paid work a substantial proportion of people do not do so</s>
<s>nor should you have gone on to assert that the scheme was “apparently successful”</s>
<s>as yet we have no data to indicate whether participants in the scheme fared better than nonparticipants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in my view work experience schemes have much to commend them in principle but those who support them should argue on the basis of facts and evidence</s>

<s>sir – the beginning of the end of autocracy is the deeper meaning of your story about russia “the beginning of the end of putin” march 3rd</s>
<s>when one stands back and surveys a thousand years of russian history even the 74 years of the soviet union was but a resistant last chapter in the inevitable progression from autocracy to democracy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in my more than 20 years of russian business i have never hired and worked with such bright intelligent and loyal young men and women</s>
<s>they are part of the growing middle class that is leading the change to a real and productive democracy</s>
<s>it will take time but it is happening and we the west should let it happen at its own speed co operating when appropriate</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>sir – i enjoyed your article on the potential for the worlds largest nonsubsidised solar market “starting from scratch” march 3rd</s>
<s>however you repeated the same richworld prejudices that have distorted this market for two decades</s>
<s>solar has been cheaper than kerosene and diesel generator sets in many countries for more than ten years</s>
<s>and similar business models and technologies for prepayment systems for solar have been successfully used in ethiopia since 2005 and in india since 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the market failure is not the users ability to pay which is addressed by a prepayment system</s>
<s>it is the willingness of innovative companies to provide durable products and build the aftersales service network required for solar to live up to its promise</s>

<s> sir – your article on the european unions problems with its carbon emissions trading scheme had the dateline of longyearbyen “breathing difficulties” march 3rd</s>
<s>the “familiar sort of eurofudge” that the article said is being thrashed out to address low carbon prices deals exclusively with certain internal problems of the eu</s>
<s>whereas longyearbyen population 2100 is an exceptionally pleasant town on all counts it is certainly not part of the european union</s>
<s>to us inhabitants of the high north it seems grossly unfair to write from longyearbyen on such an alien subject matter</s>

<s> sir – it is unfortunate that your newspaper in an issue otherwise critical of overregulation in america denounced the regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny reins act “of sunstein and sunsets” february 18th</s>
<s>the united states federal government issues 80 to 100 “major” regulations those costing more than $100 million a year</s>
<s>the relevant question posed by the reins act is who should be responsible for these laws</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our constitution vests all legislative powers in congress</s>
<s>however congress under the direction of both parties has delegated too much of the constitutional responsibility for making law to the executive branch</s>
<s>congress takes credit for enacting vague laws that frontload the benefits and delay the details restrictions and costs</s>
<s>in practice this process enables congress to shift accountability for the details of the legislation they approve blaming the unelected bureaucracy of federal agencies for the cost of the policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reins act would make congress directly accountable for the most costly major regulations by requiring an up or down vote within a proscribed timeline before it can take effect</s>
<s>by requiring this approval step for every major regulation the reins act would foster greater upfront cooperation between agencies and future congresses resulting in better legislation and regulation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bills acronym as a metaphor for the reins on a horse is fitting</s>
<s>the purpose of reins is not to keep a horse at a standstill but to keep it in check to ensure that it acts according to the intent and will of the rider</s>
<s>the reins act ensures that the peoples representatives are accountable for the laws they pass as well as the major regulatory costs that may follow</s>

<s>sir – at the age of 87 i am too old to comprehend the complexities of todays financial innovation special report february 25th</s>
<s>but my experience as an insurance supervisor at the department of trade in the 1970s may provide some guidance for todays problems</s>
<s>at that time the insurance industry was very innovative equitylinked policies property bonds guaranteedincome bonds and the like</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the department our approach was based on three simple principles</s>
<s>one there is no limit to human ingenuity in finding new ways to go bust</s>
<s>two new companies are vulnerable and new ideas involve new risks</s>
<s>three rapid growth can be particularly dangerous and innovation is safest when located in small departments of large and wellrun companies</s>
<s>these principles still summarise a great deal of your report</s>

<s>sir – lexington concluded his column on the fratricidal war among republicans by saying that barack obama “is a lucky man” february 25th</s>
<s>luck has nothing to do with it</s>
<s>the republican spectrum runs from rick santorums social and religious warriors who do not believe in the separation of church and state to ron pauls libertarians who dream of inhabiting a lockean paradise where the government is shrunk beyond recognition</s>
