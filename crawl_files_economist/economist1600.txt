<s>man has vanquished only one disease smallpox</s>
<s>in 2007 bill gates set out to eradicate another malaria</s>
<s>the world health organisation who was soon rallying its troops to the cause and a flood of money followed</s>
<s>$612m went to research in 2009 alone</s>
<s>this week the bill  melinda gates foundation trumpeted another announcement results from a phase iii trial the more extensive process of testing drugs in people of a malaria vaccine called rtss</s>
<s>this is the worlds most advanced vaccine for malaria and the results published in the new england journal of medicine were encouraging</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is an important step in combating a disease that still kills more than 700000 people a year and debilitates millions more</s>
<s>but it is also a reminder of how much work remains to be done</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr gates is only malarias latest adversary</s>
<s>the parasite has plagued man for millennia</s>
<s>chinese texts from 2700bc describe plants to treat its fevers</s>
<s>more recently in 1955 the who embarked on its first malariaeradication effort</s>
<s>but transmission rates in africa seemed intractable</s>
<s>after 14 years the who gave up</s>
<s>the last time the world tried to eliminate malaria some scientists lament the world eliminated malariologists</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new wave of enthusiasm came with the founding of the roll back malaria partnership in 1998 to coordinate planning the path malaria vaccine initiative in 1999 with money from the gates foundation and the united nations global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria in 2002</s>
<s>this culminated in mr gatess call to arms four years ago and has helped to lower the number of malaria deaths by 20 over the past decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more progress will be difficult</s>
<s>the existing tools of insecticidetreated bed nets and treatment drugs require careful coordination and good health systems</s>
<s>eliminating malaria in a stable country is dramatically easier than doing so in a turbulent one</s>
<s>worryingly these tools may become less effective</s>
<s>parasites in southeast asia for example seem to be developing resistance to artemisininbased treatments</s>
<s>to achieve eradication—or anything close to it—new weapons are needed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rtss developed by glaxosmithkline gsk a british pharmaceutical company will help</s>
<s>the vaccine tries to stop one type of malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum before it has a chance to wreak havoc</s>
<s>a mosquitos bite delivers malaria to the body</s>
<s>travelling swiftly to the liver the parasites hide mature and multiply before staging a grand second act in the bloodstream where they invade red blood cells multiply again and invade more cells</s>
<s>rtss combines a circumsporozoite protein which exists on the parasites surface with a protein from a hepatitis b vaccine</s>
<s>together these trigger an immune response which can fight off invading parasites before the second act</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gsk tested the vaccine in 6000 infants across subsaharan africa</s>
<s>it reduced the risk of clinical malaria by 56 and severe malaria by 47</s>
<s>this efficacy was “on the positive side of what we were expecting” says christian loucq of the path malaria vaccine initiative gsks partner on rtss</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however more is to come</s>
<s>the trial examined children aged 517 months</s>
<s>results for younger babies will follow</s>
<s>still uncertain is how long the vaccines protection lasts</s>
<s>the first year that the vaccine might be used would be 2015 and that is if everything goes as planned</s>
<s>even then it is unclear how rtss might be deployed</s>
<s>its price is uncertain and its power limited</s>
<s>“we realise that rtss is not the ultimate malaria vaccine” says david brandlingbennett of the gates foundation</s>
<s>“but it will have some role</s>
<s>the challenge is figuring out what that role is”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>researchers are already working on the next generation of vaccines</s>
<s>gsk hopes to induce a stronger immune response by combining rtss with a vaccine from crucell another drug firm</s>
<s>scientists are also keen to develop vaccines that target different kinds of malaria parasites and in different ways—for example in mosquitoes guts</s>
<s>all of this work requires further investment at a time when global health programmes must compete fiercely for cash</s>
<s>mr gates has helped to spur progress</s>
<s>sustaining it is the next challenge</s>
