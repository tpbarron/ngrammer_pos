<s>terri pepper gavulic an alumna of the university of florida says dont be fooled into thinking a distancelearning mba is anything but tough</s>
<s>but she wouldnt have had it any other way</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>recently i had a midlife crisis</s>
<s>while many people might buy a sports car or resort to plastic surgery i went back to school for an mba</s>
<s>as a management consultant working mum and frequent flier i needed a flexible schedule so decided on distance learning</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the list of highlyranked programmes seemed a short one but i was delighted to discover the university of florida on it—id taken my undergraduate degree there almost 30 years before</s>
<s>its internet mba seemed tailormade for me—a 27 month programme with oncampus sessions every eight weeks on the weekend</s>
<s>for me the sixhour drive seemed manageable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>taking the gmat entrance exam was a wakeup call that i was about to embark on an experience that would require a lot of maths</s>
<s>this more than anything else caused the most anxiety throughout my mba</s>
<s>but my admissions officer was encouraging and thought i could overcome my maths deficiency</s>
<s>he was right</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as an older student i had a lot to prove and wouldnt contemplate failure</s>
<s>so i applied to the programme as early as i could</s>
<s>that way the admissions team could make a decision based on my merits without having to compare me to other candidates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first day we headed out for team building including rope courses and group challenges</s>
<s>it was a smart way to start the programme</s>
<s>we bonded instantly and our cohort was quickly able to size each other up and determine with whom we wanted to work on our class teams</s>
<s>also some activities were physically challenging and terrifying</s>
<s>for many of us overcoming our fear walking a tightrope or leaping off a 30foot pole gave us confidence that we could do anything including succeed on our mba programme</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and then the hard work began</s>
<s>theres a lot i liked about my mba</s>
<s>but it is also important to be aware of the drawbacks</s>
<s>if i were to list the toughest challenges they would be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● working in a virtual team made it harder to hold teammates accountable and resolve conflicts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● the curriculum was modified after wed started and we didnt have a few promised classes including the one i most wanted</s>
<s>distancelearning programmes dont usually allow for elective courses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● balancing family and work can be daunting</s>
<s>everyone makes sacrifices</s>
<s>some classmates dropped out because they couldnt manage this aspect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● i wish i had been forewarned about some of the things i could do in advance to prepare such as learn calculus relearn algebra and brush up on excel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● our schedule was rigorous</s>
<s>we went for 27 months straight with no breaks at all—not even one day off</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but dont let that scare you</s>
<s>the positive aspects outweighed the challenges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● most of our professors were fabulous</s>
<s>they had realworld experience and were not too academic</s>
<s>several used innovative teaching methods—bringing in venture capitalists for us to present to for example—which kept the interest high</s>
<s>and they were always accessible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● visiting the campus only every eight weeks and only on the weekend was manageable for busy professionals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● the curriculum was the right blend of the quantitative eg finance and operations management and qualitative eg marketing and entrepreneurship courses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● the programme was wellorganised and the support staff were incredible</s>
<s>we were always well fed encouraged and had no uncertainty about our schedule</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● my classmates and i felt we had an impact on the programme and our feedback was regularly solicited</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>● at the end of 27 months with the same cohort we formed lasting friendships and business relationships</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when people ask what i thought of the distance learning format i tell them i cant imagine going to school any other way</s>
<s>studying from the comfort of my own home allowed me to continue being active in family life and meet my work obligations</s>
<s>but students require different skills than on a traditional programme</s>
<s>distance students must be technology savvy organised and selfmotivated</s>
<s>in our programme every class involved a blend of team and individual assignments so good communication skills both written and verbal were essential to be successful on virtual teams</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when we donned our caps and gowns we were a smaller group than when we climbed the 30foot pole 27 months earlier</s>
<s>several classmates had dropped out for reasons ranging from job transfers to an inability to do the work</s>
<s>i stuck it out though there were many times when i felt over my head</s>
<s>in my company we talk about the “big why”</s>
<s>why do we work hard</s>
<s>what motivates us</s>
<s>walking across the graduation stage 30 years after id received my undergraduate degree i closely watched my tenyearold daughters face beam with pride</s>
<s>that in a nutshell was my big why</s>
