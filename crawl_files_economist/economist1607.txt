<s>it is still gaining members—there were 955m by the end of june—but facebook has been losing friends ever since it became a public company on may 18th</s>
<s>delays in trading on the frenzied opening day were scarcely the socialnetworking company’s fault</s>
<s>but not since that first day has the share price closed above its bloated debut mark of $38 and recently it has lurched lower</s>
<s>it dropped by 8 after hours on july 25th when zynga a games company that uses facebook as a base reported poor quarterly results and by another 10 after facebook’s own figures came out the next day</s>
<s>it has fallen further since</s>
<s>on august 1st facebook’s shares closed at $2088 the lowest yet see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new shareholders are not the only ones feeling fed up</s>
<s>on july 30th limited run a new york platform for the online shops of record labels artists and designers said it would delete its facebook page</s>
<s>it estimated that 80 of clicks came from “bots”—computers rather than people but triggering payments to facebook all the same</s>
<s>limited run added that after it changed its name from limited pressing facebook asked it to spend $2000 a month on advertising to change the name of its page on the network to match</s>
<s>calling facebook “scumbags” it invited its human visitors to follow it on twitter instead</s>
<s>facebook says it is investigating and that “there seems to be some sort of miscommunication” about the change of page name for which it does not charge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in its own way the latest droop in the share price is as mysterious as the bots apparently plaguing limited run</s>
<s>granted the news from zynga which alone provides 10 of facebook’s revenues was a shock</s>
<s>facebook made a quarterly loss of $157m but that was more than explained by the accounting cost of sharebased compensation</s>
<s>and revenue growth slowed to 32 in the year to the second quarter</s>
<s>yet that was pretty much what analysts had expected perhaps a little better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nonetheless there are reasons to be sceptical about the speed at which facebook’s revenues and profits can grow</s>
<s>in america and much of europe just about anyone who might want to join already has and the ratio of daily to monthly users ticked down in north america europe and asia—a sign to some of “facebook fatigue”</s>
<s>so facebook must make money from the members it has rather than simply by adding new ones</s>
<s>and it must find a way to do so on mobile devices from which most facebookers now check the site 569 of monthly users did so in the second quarter</s>
<s>there is little space for ads on a smartphone and ads must not just avoid irritating users but make them click</s>

<p>
<s>i want to sell you a story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebook sees “sponsored stories” in users’ news feeds the main flow of information about their friends as the tool for this job</s>
<s>these are ads that companies can pay to highlight with the aim of seeing them spread by recommendation</s>
<s>sheryl sandberg the chief operating officer told analysts that clickthrough rates on ads in news feeds were “multiple times better” than on ads to the right of the screen</s>
<s>ms sandberg and mark zuckerberg facebook’s founder and boss said stories in news feeds were bringing in more than $1m a day half of that from mobile devices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that sounds promising but it is not yet a lot of money</s>
<s>steve weinstein of itg investment research says that sponsored stories are “an ad product that is not going to ramp up overnight” which explains the cautious tone of facebook’s bosses</s>
<s>advertising through friends’ recommendations on social networks is still new</s>
<s>so advertisers will need to learn what sponsored stories ought to look like and then be convinced to spend money on them</s>
<s>they will also need to keep refreshing stories which in turn will mean more expense</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg also pointed to two other initiatives</s>
<s>one is an exchange on which marketers will be able to bid for ad impressions in realtime</s>
<s>this is standard in the industry but new for facebook</s>
<s>the other is a push for ads from small and mediumsized businesses but not perhaps limited run</s>
<s>recently says brian wieser of pivotal research group big advertisers working with agencies which accounted for perhaps onethird of facebook’s ad revenue last year have been building up their spending with facebook</s>
<s>spending by small firms and online businesses has stalled leading to the slowdown in facebook’s growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with these plans thinks mr wieser facebook is doing the right things</s>
<s>he dismisses worries about falling ratios of daily to monthly users</s>
<s>far more americans visit facebook than other socialmedia sites and they spend more time online there than anywhere else</s>
<s>so there is “no other satisfactory provider for most marketers” with a “social” strategy</s>
<s>he thinks the shares were overpriced at $38 but have now sunk unreasonably low</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebook may take comfort from the enthusiasm of others for the social world</s>
<s>this week google was said to have paid $400m for wildfire interactive a socialmarketing firm oracle and salesforcecom have also been recent buyers in the field</s>
<s>a new report by the mckinsey global institute the research arm of a consultancy sees vast untapped potential in companies’ use of social technologies internally as well as in dealings with customers</s>
<s>gartner another research firm said this week that failing to communicate with customers on social networks could be as damaging to companies as not answering phone calls or emails</s>
<s>mr weinstein notes that facebook “is still valued like a very successful business” worth $50 billion indeed at only eight years of age</s>
