<s>the travelling circus gathers at brusselss gare du midi from where an extralong chartered train speeds members of the european parliament assistants and others including journalists to their alternative home in strasbourg</s>
<s>having changed hands between france and germany five times in a century the city is supposed to stand for postwar reconciliation</s>
<s>these days though the monthly caravan has become a glaring symbol of the european unions capacity for waste</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chauffeured cars whisk meps between their sleek parliamentary complex and the citys hotels and restaurants where prices are shamelessly inflated for the occasion</s>
<s>meps for the most part loathe the disruption</s>
<s>yet there is little they can do about a twoseat system plus support functions in luxembourg enshrined in treaties that can be changed only by unanimity</s>
<s>meps attempt to cut one of this years 12 strasbourg sessions prompted france to file a lawsuit</s>
<s>plainly the european parliament is not sovereign</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so the strasbourg jamboree invites a double contempt</s>
<s>first the extra costs of sitting in strasbourg reckoned at some €180m $235m a year are scandalous at a time of biting austerity</s>
<s>and second the parliament is irrelevant when it comes to seeking redress</s>
<s>this helps explain a paradox as the parliament gains more power ever fewer citizens turn out to vote for it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most issues that matter to voters such as health education and policing are handled by national parliaments</s>
<s>the eu deals mainly with arcane regulatory questions</s>
<s>but that is only part of the reason voters cannot see how their choice of mep matters</s>
<s>legislation is proposed by the european commission the eus civil service led by an appointed college</s>
<s>laws must then be approved by the council of ministers where governments strike deals behind closed doors and the european parliament where alliances shift from issue to issue</s>
<s>differences must be resolved by haggling among all three bodies</s>
<s>the system provides lots of checks and balances</s>
<s>but voters cannot throw the bums out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this chronic problem of democratic legitimacy has become acute thanks to the euro crisis</s>
<s>brussels has acquired new powers to monitor national budgets and other possible “imbalances”</s>
<s>austerity and reforms have been imposed on countries that have been rescued from collapse—ireland portugal and above all greece</s>
<s>but the “economic governance” is also being felt elsewhere</s>
<s>italys prime minister silvio berlusconi was replaced with a technocrat mario monti</s>
<s>within days of taking office belgiums new socialist prime minister elio di rupo was told to cut his budget or face sanctions</s>
<s>hungary has just been told it will lose €495m of aid next year if it fails to control its deficit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“governments are only just beginning to understand how much power they have handed over to the eu” says one eurocrat</s>
<s>but who should control that power</s>
<s>the european parliament is an imperfect body in an imperfect system</s>
<s>can it make up for the loss of national sovereignty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some think so</s>
<s>last month mr monti went to strasbourg to praise the parliament for its tough scrutiny of the commission of which he had once been part</s>
<s>in an article written with a french mep sylvie goulard he placed most of the blame for the crisis on national democracies</s>
<s>angela merkel the german chancellor speaks of a future “political union” with a strong parliament as well as a directly elected commission president</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for others the parliament is not the solution but part of the problem</s>
<s>jack straw a former british foreign secretary recently advocated its abolition</s>
<s>the “democratic deficit” he said would be better plugged by an assembly of national mps than by a directly elected body</s>
<s>germanys constitutional court ruled in 2009 that the parliament did not have the credentials for the bundestag to surrender control of the budget among other things</s>
<s>so meps can influence how eu money is spent not how it is raised</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the council of ministers regards the parliament as a truculent adolescent meps think they understand the european interest better than the ministers they talk big measuring themselves against americas congress without having its means they constantly push for more power and more money and they always want more europe whatever voters think</s>
<s>commission officials also express exasperation in private</s>
<s>though often their ally they say the european parliament has the power to dismiss the commission but bears none of the costs for its actions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>politics begins at home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is no neat solution to the problem of democracy in a system that is part intergovernmental and part federal</s>
<s>it is hard to argue that brussels needs less direct democracy when it is acquiring more powers</s>
<s>eu business is now too demanding to be performed by parttimers</s>
<s>look at the european parliaments neighbour in strasbourg the council of europe an older body separate from the eu it has an assembly of national mps that meets twice a year but its work is so obscure that britains conservatives can be allies of vladimir putins united russia party</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>legitimacy requires reforms at both national and european levels</s>
<s>the european parliaments 754 meps should be sharply pruned as should its inflated costs</s>
<s>its workings involve too many cosy deals among europes big party alliances</s>
<s>that said countries will remain central to the eu no matter how far it integrates</s>
<s>the eus powers and money are conferred by states</s>
<s>eu laws are enacted through governments</s>
<s>above all politics is mainly national</s>
<s>so national parliaments need to be more involved in the eus work starting with closer scrutiny of its policies</s>
<s>the danish system in which the folketing parliament agrees to ministers negotiating mandates before they go to brussels is a good example</s>
<s>for all its flaws the european parliament is here to stay</s>
<s>all aboard the next train to strasbourg</s>
