<s>like children eagerly awaiting christmas american media firms look forward to evennumbered years</s>
<s>call it election affection</s>
<s>every two years political campaigns spend billions of dollars on tasteful fairminded adverts</s>
<s>a spot showing paul ryan tossing grandma off a cliff which first aired last year is typical see picture</s>
<s>and where there is mud there is moolah</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in addition to the presidential race this year candidates are vying for 435 seats in the house of representatives 33 in the senate 11 governorships and countless local posts</s>
<s>in 2008 barack obama’s extraordinary fundraising helped push spending on political ads to a record $42 billion</s>
<s>can we top that</s>
<s>yes we can</s>
<s>some expect this year’s haul to be 23 higher at $52 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the biggest profits are still to come</s>
<s>the mudslinging gets really messy only after the conventions the democratic one ended on september 6th</s>
<s>this is also the first presidential election to test the impact of a 2010 supreme court decision that allows companies and unions to spend unlimited sums on election ads</s>
<s>this has brought a flood of new cash to the airwaves</s>
<s>“super” political action committees pacs have spent around $219m so far more than mitt romney’s $163m and close to mr obama’s $263m</s>
<s>restore our future a super pac that backs mr romney has already spent around $82m according to the centre for responsive politics a watchdog</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bulk goes to local tv advertising—what david axelrod an adviser to mr obama calls the “nuclear weapon” of elections</s>
<s>local broadcasting stations are a cheaper way to reach specific audiences than national cable spots</s>
<s>spending on tv will attract $34 billion in this election cycle and 83 of that will go towards local tv see chart</s>
<s>most political ads appear during the local news</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cable companies such as comcast are courting campaign dollars by promising even more precisely aimed ad placement than is possible on local tv</s>
<s>as a result cable operators have quadrupled politicaladvertising revenues since 2004 to $467m and doubled their share of the pot</s>
<s>but the biggest winners will be firms such as sinclair broadcast group and gray television which own lots of local stations in critical swing states</s>
<s>the 2008 presidential campaign was fought mostly in 14 swing states this year’s will focus on a mere nine or so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such concentration has given local stations greater pricing power says michael o’brien of scripps media which owns local stations in ohio and elsewhere</s>
<s>as november 6th nears and advertisers snap up more of the available spots in swing states rates will soar</s>
<s>marci ryvicker a managing director at wells fargo a bank reckons that a spot in a swing state that normally goes for $50000 could go for ten times that as the election approaches</s>
<s>this hurts nonpolitical advertisers who must pay more to tout their doughnuts and haircuts</s>
<s>of course they can always wait for november 7th when prices will plunge again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as campaigns harness ever more data they grow better at “microtargeting” tailoring messages to specific groups of voters</s>
<s>this works moderately well with traditional media</s>
<s>for example you can place an ad applauding or denouncing mr ryan’s plan for medicare health care for the elderly during a tv show that old people like</s>
<s>or you can send flyers to people in specific neighbourhoods or to registered independents who may be swayable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the greatest potential for microtargeting is online</s>
<s>by the end of this election cycle spending on online political ads will have increased more than tenfold since 2004 admittedly from a low base of $30m and will account for around 6 of advertising revenues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google search ads used to account for the bulk of online advertising dollars it was a straightforward way for campaigns to provide information about their activities to those searching for it</s>
<s>but now socialmedia firms such as facebook and twitter are also competing for political spending</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>campaigns have started to look beyond the usual search and banner ads and are shelling out more for video ads on popular news sites such as cnncom niche websites and video sites such as youtube which is owned by google</s>
<s>on youtube viewers can choose which ad they want to see and a campaign pays only if the video is actually watched</s>
<s>both parties are growing more ambitious online</s>
<s>whereas once they used online advertising mainly to raise money and mobilise volunteers today they are trying to persuade people to vote for them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other sure winners of this election are the marketing firms that collect data about voters’ incomes family status and webbrowsing history</s>
<s>they sell this information to campaigns which use it to match appropriate ads to receptive eyeballs</s>
<s>zac moffatt mr romney’s digitalcampaign director says online spending is critical because it helps candidates reach “on demanders” and “people who are off the grid” the 29 of voters who according to a recent study by firms including say media a digital consultancy have not watched live tv in the past week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>media firms have one or two gripes</s>
<s>a new ruling by the federal communications commission will require broadcasters in the 50 largest markets to make public which political groups they have sold ads to and what they have charged</s>
<s>that could make it harder for them to jack up prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their biggest grumble however is that odd years follow even ones</s>
<s>there will be a few ballot initiatives and local races in 2013 but nothing to compare with the bonanza of a battle for the white house</s>
<s>so media companies should enjoy the next two months of mudslinging</s>
<s>afterwards they will have to go back to selling ads for soap powder</s>
