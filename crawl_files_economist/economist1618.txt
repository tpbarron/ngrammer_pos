<s>despite their huge popularity some mbas dont consider distancelearning programmes to be the “real thing”</s>
<s>the way to truly experience a subject they argue is to fully immerse oneself in a fulltime programme giving opportunity for deep contemplation away from outside pressures</s>
<s>furthermore if the old adage about learning as much from your fellow students as from the professors is true then interacting every day with a fulltime cohort has obvious advantages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but distance learning has its own rewards</s>
<s>firstly it gives an opportunity for bright students in farflung parts of the world to access a topquality business education which would otherwise be unavailable to them</s>
<s>whats more as distancelearning students tend to work while they study they have the opportunity to apply what they have learnt immediately within their own companies making their studies far more practical</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so should one type of programme be considered intrinsically superior</s>
<s>or are they just different</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>update readers comments are starting to come in</s>
<s>jollyrogerii thinks we have the question the wrong way round “frankly i think being able to manage a fulltime job and an mba at the same time indicates someone that is better able to manage and juggle lifes pressures than someone that chooses to do an mba full time”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but webmaven thinks the sector might be heading for a fall “my prediction is that the next bubble will be in online education</s>
<s>with mortgage and credit card debt already crushing many family budgets student load debt from some schools rightfully dubbed as diploma mills will be the next block to fall in the trinity of consumer default”</s>
