<s>the new push comes as a bolder set of ambitions hits trouble</s>
<s>as part of the millennium development goals world leaders promised in 2000 to curb the toll of hiv malaria and tuberculosis by 2015</s>
<s>that brought a spending splurge—donations for health projects in poor countries more than doubled between 2001 and 2008 see chart</s>
<s>the death rate for malaria dropped by more than a quarter</s>
<s>but the economic crisis has tightened fists</s>
<s>christopher murray of the university of washington reckons annual spendinggrowth from 2009 to 2011 was only 4</s>
<s>excluding the world banks money mostly loans to middleincome countries giving is nearly flat</s>

<p>
<s>the whiff of mismanagement has lowered spirits too</s>
<s>the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria an outfit specially created to help meet the last lot of goals is making no new grants until 2014</s>
<s>it had projected too optimistically a 20 rise in donations in 201113</s>
