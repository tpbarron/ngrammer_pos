<s>stay or go</s>
<s>that question has dogged deutsche telekom ever since regulators blocked the german company’s sale of tmobile usa its american wireless business to att on competition grounds last year</s>
<s>now the germans have given an answer on october 3rd deutsche telekom and metropcs announced that tmobile usa would merge with its smaller american rival</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regulators are unlikely to stand in the way of the deal which the two firms hope to complete by mid2013</s>
<s>together they have almost 43m subscribers but their combined share of the wireless market will still be less than that of sprint nextel america’s thirdlargest player see chart</s>
<s>“this deal does not appear to trigger any regulatory tripwires” says paul gallant of guggenheim partners an investment firm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but it should trigger plenty of benefits by creating a stronger competitor for att and verizon wireless which dominate the industry</s>
<s>the new firm to be called tmobile will have access to more precious wireless spectrum and can streamline investment in a superfast 4g network</s>
<s>it will also have the financial clout to promote the lowcost nocontract call plans that have boosted metropcs</s>
<s>sanford c bernstein an investment bank estimates that the firm will have almost 30 of this part of the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the proposal also gives deutsche telekom a way to reduce its exposure to america though it claims it is committed to the country</s>
<s>the new firm of which the germans will get 74 and metropcs’s shareholders will get the rest plus $15 billion in cash will use metropcs’s stockmarket listing</s>
<s>this setup will eventually allow deutsche telekom to sell shares without losing control</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the big loser from all this is likely to be sprint sandwiched between att and verizon which rule the high end of the market and the new tmobile below</s>
<s>sprint could still offer to buy tmobile usa for a fat premium but the germans seem keen on the fit with metropcs</s>
<s>it could make a hostile bid for metropcs but such a battle would be hard to win</s>
<s>or it could try to buy the merged firm later but regulators might object to this</s>
<s>sprint may have nowhere to run</s>
