<s>hoping to diversify exports away from the united states the canadian government has been avidly courting asian investment in naturalresource industries</s>
<s>when petronas malaysia’s state energy firm offered c$6 billion $6 billion in july for progress energy a producer of unconventional natural gas the bid appeared tailormade for the ruling conservative party</s>
<s>though malaysia’s government is mildly authoritarian it is hardly a political lightning rod like china’s</s>
<s>and petronas said it would build a useful export terminal for liquefied natural gas on the pacific coast</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so analysts were puzzled when the government announced it would reject the deal at least for now</s>
<s>just before the midnight deadline on october 19th the industry ministry issued a terse statement saying the bid did not meet the “net benefit to canada” standard required by law</s>
<s>petronas still has 30 days to amend its offer</s>
<s>but even if the firm gets a reprieve investors are unlikely to forget the episode</s>
<s>shares in other canadian resource companies seen as takeover targets fell on the news</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the government provided no explanation for its decision theories abound as to its reasoning</s>
<s>observers inclined to give stephen harper the prime minister the benefit of the doubt see the rejection as a tactical sacrifice</s>
<s>as lucrative as the petronas proposal is it pales in comparison to the c$15 billion china’s cnooc has offered for nexen a midsized oil producer in the western tar sands</s>
<s>the government has gone to great lengths to woo chinese capital and last month the two countries signed an investmentprotection treaty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however polls show that most canadians oppose takeovers by staterun firms in naturalresource industries</s>
<s>by at least delaying the petronas tieup the government may hope to build up credibility with the public that it could later spend on the cnoocnexen deal</s>
<s>it has also insulated itself from charges of an antichina bias</s>
<s>a decision is due before november 12th</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a less charitable view is that the conservatives lack a policy</s>
<s>they approved the sales of two leading mining firms and canada’s biggest aluminium producer to foreigners in 200607 but blocked a deal with bhp billiton an australian mining giant for a potash company in 2010</s>
<s>on october 22nd mr harper promised to issue new guidelines “in the nottoodistant future …regarding these sorts of transactions” investors and voters await them eagerly</s>
