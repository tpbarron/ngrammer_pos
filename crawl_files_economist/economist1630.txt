<s>for almost two years george osborne the chancellor of the exchequer has steered britain in a more austere fiscal direction than any other country that has much choice in the matter</s>
<s>it has been a joyless journey but so far a successful one</s>
<s>the deficit has been cut from more than 11 of gdp to a figure likely to be around 8 in 201112</s>
<s>the credibility established in bond markets by such progress allows mr osborne some wiggle room in his third budget which he will put before parliament on march 21st</s>
<s>he should use it to encourage large businesses which have plenty of money to spend it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to finance its government deficit britain draws on a large privatesector savings surplus as well as modest borrowing from abroad</s>
<s>its householders racked up huge debts during the credit boom so it is no great surprise that they are putting aside more of their income now</s>
<s>but much of the privatesector saving glut is caused by companies which were saving hard even before the financial crisis struck see article</s>
<s>as the savings continue to pile up cash held by nonbank private companies has risen to an astonishing £700 billion $1 trillion</s>
<s>business investment in britain is weak by the standards of other rich countries—one reason why its recovery has been so sluggish</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>piling cash high selling investment short</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>firms have been hoarding cash for many reasons fears about financial collapse in europe worries about demand in britains main markets a strategy to keep money handy to build a presence in fastergrowing markets and so on</s>
<s>mr osborne can do little about such concerns</s>
<s>but now that the world economys prospects are a little brighter he can tilt corporate decisions towards investing in britain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>progress towards a more rational tax system would be a good start</s>
<s>personal income taxes sit alongside employee nationalinsurance contributions—once a socialinsurance levy now an auxiliary wage tax</s>
<s>merging them would simplify taxes and cut administrative costs for businesses especially small ones</s>
<s>taxes could also be simplified by introducing a general antiavoidance rule</s>
<s>one reason why the tax code is so burdensome is that each tax break begets pages of code to prevent it from being used in ways that were not intended</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr osborne could also promote investment through small giveaways</s>
<s>one anomaly is that investment in some buildings and structures does not attract tax relief in the way that spending on machinery does</s>
<s>allowing for new infrastructure investment to be set against tax over 40 years would lower the cost of such projects by 7 and cost the treasury a modest £130m a year according to the cbi an employers group</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cutting the top rate of personal income tax from 50 would encourage entrepreneurs to make britain their home</s>
<s>it will be hard for mr osborne to do this in a year when welfare spending is being squeezed</s>
<s>he could however make further progress on lowering the rate of tax on corporate profits which is set to fall to 23 by 201415</s>
<s>a further onepercentagepoint reduction would cost around £800m a year and send a signal that britain is a competitive place to invest and do business</s>
<s>that message would be all the stronger if mr osborne were to set aside some money for extra public investment—a more reliable stimulus to the economy than say a vat cut</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the progress made so far on public finances means that boosting the capital budget by £5 billion or so would be unlikely to unnerve bond markets</s>
<s>mr osbornes main fiscal rule allows for such spending which adds to the economys potential</s>
<s>his fiscal plan has earned him the room for manoeuvre that many other european countries no longer have</s>
<s>it would be a shame if he did not use it</s>
