<s>republican politicians do not yet blame barack obama personally for the recent changes in americas weather</s>
<s>that would stick in the craw given that in spite of overwhelming scientific evidence most of them still question and many deny that man plays a role in global warming</s>
<s>they do however blame mr obama for the rise in the price of oil</s>
<s>this is odd too especially for a party that as a rule likes to believe in the impotence of governments and the omnipotence of markets</s>
<s>as any competent economist will tell you the price of oil is set in the market—the world market that is—and not in the white house</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are times however when the temptation to blame the man in the white house is simply too great and this is one of them</s>
<s>in recent weeks the conventional wisdom in politics has been that the neverending republican primaries the assorted weaknesses of the four remaining candidates and the gradual but steady improvement in the economy have transformed mr obamas chances of a second term</s>
<s>the improving economy is especially bothersome to republicans since it was the lack of growth and jobs that was supposed to guarantee the presidents defenestration in november</s>
<s>with one possible eleventhhour exception attempts to find alternative angles of attack have not shown conspicuous success</s>
<s>newt gingrich and especially rick santorum have done their best to reheat the culture wars</s>
<s>but knocking abortion contraception and the 21st century in general does not look like a winning strategy far beyond deepfried southern states such as alabama and mississippi</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the possible eleventhhour exception is the rising price of petrol gasoline</s>
<s>the average american motorist is now paying $380 a gallon a record for the time of year</s>
<s>as prices have risen all the republican candidates have been selling the idea that the blame for this rise belongs primarily with mr obama—not with the markets fear of a war with iran climbing demand in china or any other more plausible explanation</s>
<s>unhappily for the president many voters appear to be buying this snake oil</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on march 12th a washington postabc poll found that nearly twothirds of americans disapproved of mr obamas handling of petrol prices and the same poll showed that februarys 50 to 46 approval of his overall performance had flipped</s>
<s>a new york timescbs news poll the same day also reported a big fall in voters good opinions of the president</s>
<s>a month ago 50 approved of how he was doing his job only 41 approve now and 47 disapprove</s>
<s>for all the recent talk not least in this column about the damage the republicans are inflicting on themselves in their primaries both polls had mr obama and mitt romney just about level for novembers election with mr santorums chances against mr obama only a few points behind mr romneys</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the polls do not reveal how much of the presidents shrivelling approval is caused by rising petrol prices</s>
<s>nor is it likely unless they inflict much broader damage on the recovery that they alone will determine who wins in november</s>
<s>still america lives on its wheels so the anxiety in the white house is palpable and mr obama has accordingly taken to the airwaves to rebut the republican argument that he has restricted drilling in pursuit of some sinister green conspiracy</s>
<s>on his watch he says the number of operating oil rigs has quadrupled and production has reached an eightyear high</s>
<s>but the president also makes the point that a country with only 2 of the worlds oil reserves cannot simply drill its way to lower petrol prices</s>
<s>that he argues is the reason for his other measures including tighter emissions standards for cars and investment in green technology</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>needless to say mr obamas policies have their imperfections</s>
<s>the bankruptcy of a favoured solarcell manufacturer solyndra was a reminder that governments have a poor record of picking winners in technology whether green or any other colour</s>
<s>it is disingenuous of the administration to imply that extracting more tax from the oil companies which it would do like a shot if congress allowed it would not raise prices at the pump</s>
<s>and the presidents equivocation on the keystone xl pipeline which was going to carry oil from the canadian tar sands to the gulf of mexico but has now been stymied was a textbook example of how to evade hard decisions in an election year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the main question however mr obama has the better of the argument</s>
<s>america already taxes petrol far more lightly than other developed countries do</s>
<s>short of cutting petrol taxes still further john mccain and hillary clinton proposed a tax holiday during the 2008 race or mounting an irresponsible raid on the strategic oil reserve for political purposes he has no ready way to make petrol cheaper for the american voter</s>
<s>nor do his republican critics even though mr gingrich is pushing a cockamamie claim that unbridled drilling could swiftly cut the price to $250</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>americas sacred plenty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that being said having the better of the argument is not the only thing that matters in politics</s>
<s>the republican case does not survive much scrutiny but on this issue mr obamas opponents may be more in tune than he is with americas instincts</s>
<s>the president is after all undeniably guilty of some cautious environmentalism</s>
<s>and as simon schama a historian pointed out four years ago in “the american future” bodley head no one ever won an election by telling america that it had come to the end of its “providential allotment of inexhaustible plenty”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it may then be no coincidence that mr obamas nobelprizewinning energy secretary steven chu chose this week to tell congress that he no longer wishes as he did before getting his job for american fuel prices to rise to european levels to encourage efficiency</s>
<s>mr obama cannot cut the price of petrol</s>
<s>but he had better at least give the impression that he wants to</s>
