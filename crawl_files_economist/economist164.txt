<s>colonial williamsburg in virginia and the french medieval attraction of puy du fou are proof that history can be a huge tourist attraction</s>
<s>america’s largest outdoor history museum attracts 17m visitors a year</s>
<s>puy du fou slogan “get ready to travel through time” is smaller</s>
<s>but with at least 12m visitors every year between april and september the historical theme park created by a former politician philippe de villiers in france’s vendée region in 1977 is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now a british investment manager is piling into the historytourism business too</s>
<s>but for jonathan ruffer chairman of the assetmanagement firm that bears his name the stakes will be much higher</s>
<s>he wants to build a museum that tells the story of the rise of christianity in britain at a time when the church of england is losing congregations by the day</s>
<s>he also hopes it will be a thriving tourist destination attracting 120000 people a year despite being situated in one of the least visited parts of the north of england</s>
<s>what chance does he have of succeeding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the story began in 2010 when the church of england decided to raise some muchneeded funds by selling a collection of paintings by a 17thcentury spanish artist francisco de zurbarán</s>
<s>the series “jacob and his 12 sons” had hung in auckland castle the home of the bishop of durham for more than 250 years where they were regarded as a regional treasure and with their jewish theme as a symbol of britain’s religious tolerance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>worried that an auction would inevitably see the pictures leave the area a local member of parliament and a regional newspaper the northern echo mounted a protest</s>
<s>enter mr ruffer who was approaching 60 and looking for a new challenge</s>
<s>he was born in the area and has been since his university days a committed christian</s>
<s>unprompted he offered £15m $24m to save the pictures</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>selling the zurbaráns might have raised some quick cash but the castle which is far too big for the bishop was still a financial burden for the church</s>
<s>a chance encounter between mr ruffer and lord rothschild provided the answer</s>
<s>chairman of the trust that runs waddesdon manor—the former rothschild family home now reinvented as a tourist destination—lord rothschild persuaded mr ruffer that taking over auckland castle as well as the pictures was the solution</s>
<s>the negotiations with the church of england have been tortuous</s>
<s>but more than a year after they began a deal has been done the paintings and the castle a deer park and 130 acres of surrounding land for £11m</s>
<s>it is less than the original offer but mr ruffer will need to spend a lot on the castle</s>
<s>the rothschild foundation has given £1m</s>
<s>the bishop has moved somewhere smaller</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now mr ruffer is anxious to press ahead</s>
<s>staff wages and building repairs at auckland castle are costing him £40000 a month</s>
<s>he has engaged sir diarmaid macculloch oxford university’s professor of the history of the church to create a “national exhibition of religion” which will trace an arc from prechristian britain to today’s multiculturalism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>county durham was an important centre of early christianity in britain</s>
<s>there is evidence of bishops at auckland castle since 1080</s>
<s>holy island or lindisfarne and nearby durham were home to christian monks far earlier</s>
<s>a local saint bede translated many christian texts from latin and greek thus introducing them to the anglosaxons</s>
<s>his follower saint cuthbert was an important early english saint</s>
<s>cuthbert is buried in durham cathedral</s>
<s>last year the cuthbert gospel the earliest intact european book was bought for the nation from the jesuits in part with a significant donation from mr ruffer’s charity</s>
<s>the british library the gospel’s new home is keen to help auckland castle with loans as is the british museum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time mr ruffer wants to develop the park around the castle perhaps with games and historical reenactments in the hope that these will draw in bigger crowds</s>
<s>puy du fou is his template</s>
<s>next month auckland castle will apply to the heritage lottery fund for a £10m grant a big request for a new project with no record to draw on</s>
<s>mr ruffer’s personal ambition is to develop auckland castle so it helps regenerate the local town bishop auckland offering jobs and civic pride to a region that has been suffering ever since the local railway lines and coal mines began to close</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>others have tried to turn old houses into visitor attractions</s>
<s>the successful ones often have inbuilt advantages</s>
<s>waddesdon benefits from a century of fine collecting which has filled it with furniture and paintings it is also close to london</s>
<s>the duchess of northumberland can boast more than 800000 visitors a year at alnwick where she has created a huge new garden</s>
<s>but alnwick is also where the first two “harry potter” films were made which is an attraction in itself</s>
<s>auckland castle has none of these blessings</s>
<s>mr ruffer has his work cut out for him</s>
<s>but he is a rich and determined man</s>
<s>the ghosts of auckland castle are cheering him on</s>
