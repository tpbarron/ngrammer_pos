<s>bidzina ivanishvili made a bold promise a year ago</s>
<s>georgia’s richest man promised to assemble a coalition to win the parliamentary elections in 2012 and unseat the “dictatorship” of president mikheil saakashvili</s>
<s>on october 1st mr ivanishvili’s georgian dream coalition won 55 of the vote</s>
<s>mr saakashvili gracefully conceded that his united national movement unm had lost and welcomed mr ivanishvili into power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but not just yet</s>
<s>georgia remains a presidential republic for another year when constitutional amendments take effect</s>
<s>until then mr ivanishvili’s scope will be limited</s>
<s>he called for the president to resign at once then rescinded</s>
<s>mr saakashvili is not budging</s>
<s>the coming months may be bumpy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite the bickering the election is a landmark</s>
<s>never in georgian history has a government changed so peacefully and lawfully</s>
<s>that crowns other achievements of the past eight years</s>
<s>modern georgia is a far cry from the illrun backwater that mr saakashvili took over in 2003</s>
<s>transport systems and other public buildings have been transformed</s>
<s>petty corruption has vanished</s>
<s>the economy is growing fast</s>
<s>but unemployment and poverty are high and life for many is hard</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how mr ivanishvili’s disparate coalition will deal with this legacy is unclear</s>
<s>he has no political record and was all but unknown until a year ago</s>
<s>his main policy is better relations with russia</s>
<s>it defeated georgia in a short war in 2008 and occupies a fifth of its territory the selfproclaimed states of abkhazia and south ossetia</s>
<s>a change of personality at the top should make a thaw easier</s>
<s>vladimir putin the russian president once said he wanted to hang mr saakashvili “by the balls”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cause of the row was georgia’s prowestern orientation its bid to join nato was anathema to russia and regarded with deep scepticism in much of the alliance</s>
<s>mr ivanishvili says he too wants to support membership of the alliance</s>
<s>his first trip abroad may be to america</s>
<s>but the new premier’s real priority will be to revive trade with russia</s>
<s>kremlin sanctions have strangled georgian exports such as wine fruit and mineral water</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on other issues mr ivanishvili has been full of spleen about misrule but hazy about what he would do differently</s>
<s>he has promised that he will be prime minister for no more than two years</s>
<s>some doubt his coalition of liberals nationalists and eccentrics will stay together once the euphoria of victory has passed</s>
<s>david usupashvili head of the republican party says that mr ivanishvili’s business success shows he has the “ability necessary for a leader”</s>
<s>such wealth “cannot be assembled by an unwise person”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr saakashvili has some thinking to do too</s>
<s>nobody from his camp or among electionwatchers in tbilisi foresaw this outcome</s>
<s>their big worry was how to keep georgian dream loyalists perhaps backed by russia from avenging defeat with violence</s>
<s>the surprise highlights the complacency that is the ruling elite’s big weakness</s>
<s>many in mr saakashvili’s party came to believe that they were destined to rule and that criticism was treachery</s>
<s>now it has to play a new role of a strong loyal opposition</s>
<s>that may test its unity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the decisive factor in the election may have been videos of abuse in prison including a man apparently being raped with a broom</s>
<s>though their provenance was unclear for many the footage crystallised resentment against the arrogance and impunity of mr saakashvili’s rule</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neither side will find the postelection period easy</s>
<s>giga bokeria mr saakashvili’s influential national security adviser has said that mr ivanishvili has introduced “poison” into the political system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for his part mr ivanishvili said during the campaign that mr saakashvili and his officials would face unspecified “justice” once georgian dream came to power</s>
<s>among other wild talk he suggested that any supporter of mr saakashvili’s was an “accomplice in the cruellest crime”</s>
<s>even the election result is open to challenge</s>
<s>mr saakashvili’s unm claim that georgian dream activists are pressing local election commissions to change results in their favour</s>
<s>the nato observation mission in georgia has expressed “serious concern” about that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is all still fragile</s>
<s>but by admitting defeat mr saakashvili handed his country a victory and wrongfooted mr ivanishvili who had said that he would never be allowed to win elections</s>
<s>now that he has he has a great responsibility to the system that has vaulted him to power</s>
