<s>a new force is emerging in asian politics the nonpolitician—or at least the politician posing as such</s>
<s>in south korea the campaign for the presidential election in december has been shaken up by the new candidacy of an independent ahn chulsoo a former doctor turned antivirussoftware tycoon</s>
<s>in japan the new japan restoration party jrp founded by toru hashimoto the 43yearold son of a smalltime gangster who has risen to be mayor of osaka scores higher in some opinion polls than the ruling democratic party of japan dpj</s>
<s>in jakarta joko widodo known as jokowi who ran a furniture business before he became mayor of solo in central java is certain to have defeated the ruling party’s incumbent in the september 20th election for governor of jakarta official results are expected soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in pakistan the most talkedabout candidate in parliamentary elections due in the next six months is imran khan a former cricketer</s>
<s>south asia has seen many film stars and sportsmen trade their popularity for votes</s>
<s>but mr khan unlike them and like mr ahn mr hashimoto and jokowi presents himself as an outsider campaigning for a new sort of politics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>elsewhere some outsiders are transforming politics without even running for election</s>
<s>in india the anticorruption demonstrations and hungerstrikes led by anna hazare for a while dictated the terms of the national political debate</s>
<s>similarly in malaysia the government has at times seemed more worried by bersih a campaign for electoral reform led by ambiga sreenevasan a lawyer than by the formal opposition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>three factors unite these very different insurgencies</s>
<s>the first is the failure of seemingly closed and often dynastic political leaderships to renew themselves</s>
<s>indonesia’s most recent presidential election was in 2009 more than a decade after the end of the suharto dictatorship</s>
<s>but among the candidates were the daughter of the president who suharto ousted in 1965 suharto’s former soninlaw and two other generals from his time including the victorious incumbent susilo bambang yudhoyono</s>
<s>pakistan’s two big parties are familyrun conglomerates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in south korea park geunhye the ruling party’s presidential candidate is the daughter of park chunghee who seized power in a coup in 1961 and ruled until his assassination in 1979</s>
<s>this week ms park apologised for abuses during his rule which was marked by spectacular economic advance but fierce political repression</s>
<s>facing a tough challenge from both mr ahn and the opposition candidate moon jaein ms park took the awkward step especially in a confucian society of repudiating her own father</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a second common factor is rage against corruption</s>
<s>in solo jokowi was famous for mundane but effective schemes for curbing graft such as “onestop shops” for business permits where uniformed civil servants conduct their business in full view of the public</s>
<s>this replaced an expensive paper trail through murky offices</s>
<s>imran khan promises to end “all major corruption” within 90 days of taking office</s>
<s>south korea’s politicians are widely seen as in the pockets of the chaebol the big conglomerates</s>
<s>japan’s stagger from one partyfinance scandal to another</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third these are insurrections of the socialmedia generation</s>
<s>their typical activist is young urban educated and has hundreds of facebook friends</s>
<s>the internet and mobile technology enable nonpoliticians to do without big party organisations to spread the word</s>
<s>and in politics as with funny clips on youtube new enthusiasms can spread like wildfire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>broadly the advent of all these upstarts is to be welcomed</s>
<s>mr khan and mr ahn have excited young people cynical about politics</s>
<s>in jakarta jokowi already has one hugely positive achievement to his name</s>
<s>his runningmate for vicegovernor basuki tjahja purnama known as ahok is an ethnicchinese christian</s>
<s>conventional wisdom had it that such a man could not win an election in indonesia the world’s largest muslimmajority country</s>
<s>his opponent’s campaign muttered about “infidels”</s>
<s>so the victory for the jokowi ticket was also a triumph for tolerance and civilised values</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr hashimoto is harder to like</s>
<s>he may have admirable ideas for reform but his rightwing populism plays down the cruel abuses of japan’s imperial past</s>
<s>at a time of tension with china and south korea this is dangerous as well as wrong</s>
<s>but on a political stage peopled by interchangeable nonentities mr hashimoto’s entry has had a galvanising effect</s>
<s>he deserves credit for showing that political enthusiasm is still possible in japan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the farther they are from power the more attractive insurgents tend to look</s>
<s>as they approach office they are forced into sometimes grubby compromises with the forces of the establishment they purport to despise</s>
<s>this is a particular problem for mr khan and for jokowi if he aspires to national office and many hope he does</s>
<s>in indonesia and pakistan national electoral success depends on getting out the vote in the countryside</s>
<s>and that requires oldstyle politicians with local clout and organisation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the outsider’s dilemma</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr khan has recruited just such supporters from the big parties</s>
<s>he also suffers from the widespread suspicion that he has the backing of the “establishment” the euphemism which many pakistanis use for the army and intelligence services</s>
<s>even if untrue this is understandable</s>
<s>the army has a history of backing politicians who might sap support from the two big civilian parties</s>
<s>in jakarta jokowi was backed by two mainstream parties</s>
<s>mr hashimoto’s jrp has defectors from the dpj and others</s>
<s>in south korea mr ahn risks splitting the antipark vote with mr moon</s>
<s>to defeat her he may either have to withdraw and play kingmaker endorsing mr moon or become the opposition’s official candidate</s>
<s>to fight political monsters even maverick heroes may have to become monsters themselves alienating some of the very idealists they hoped to represent</s>
