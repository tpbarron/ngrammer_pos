<s>it may seem odd that timbuktu the malian city on the southwest fringe of the sahara desert is twinned with hayonwye a placid little town on the welsh side of the border with england</s>
<s>the reason for this partnership is books</s>
<s>hay is famous for its bookshops and an annual literary festival</s>
<s>timbuktu has a huge stock of arabic manuscripts some of them going back to the 12th century with topics ranging from islam and philosophy to mathematics and astronomy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but whereas hay is as gentle as ever timbuktu for the past few months has been run by fiercely aggressive islamists who control the northern twothirds of mali</s>
<s>ansar dine the group in charge of the city espouses an austere salafist version of islam</s>
<s>it has proved itself no friend of the city’s cultural heritage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>earlier this year it began smashing ancient tombs in timbuktu on the ground that they were idolatrous</s>
<s>nine were destroyed seven in a part of the town designated as a world heritage site</s>
<s>“the mission is not complete” said an ansar dine spokesman</s>
<s>but the destruction of monuments may for the moment be over</s>
<s>apart from international outrage at the vandalism it went down badly with the town’s citizens</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the safety of timbuktu’s manuscripts is less assured</s>
<s>as the rebels descended on timbuktu mali’s cultural authorities told the owners of private libraries in the city to hide their wares</s>
<s>but not all of them are safe</s>
<s>a big collection at the ahmed baba institute of higher learning and islamic research which has 30000 manuscripts is under threat</s>
<s>ansar dine has occupied it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on local radio the group said it would not harm the manuscripts</s>
<s>but many local scholars are worried</s>
<s>during their tombsmashing period the rebels paused to apologise to timbuktu’s people—then started smashing things again</s>
<s>the scrolls are not yet safe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the manuscripts offend the salafists less than the tombs or graven images do though some address the sufi school of islam which they scorn</s>
<s>timbuktu’s mayor hallé ousmane worries that ansar dine may start selling manuscripts to bring in muchneeded cash</s>
<s>others say the group sees the institute as a handy piece of property</s>
<s>samuel sidibe the director of mali’s national museum has asked ansar dine via the red cross if the manuscripts could be evacuated from timbuktu</s>
<s>it said no</s>
