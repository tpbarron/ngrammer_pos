<s>thomas hobbes famously described the original state of nature as bellum omnium contra omnes</s>
<s>californias governor jerry brown who received a jesuit education and likes to flaunt his classical learning has of late been using the phrase to describe a war of all against all in the golden state</s>
<s>it may be his undoing</s>
<s>to end californias budget crisis he wants to cut spending and raise revenues</s>
<s>and to do that this being california he must collect approximately 800000 signatures to put a measure before voters on polling day in november</s>
<s>it now seems however that at least one other tax proposal will also share the ballot that day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under californias rules if more than one measure on the same topic is approved at the ballot the one with the largest number of votes prevails</s>
<s>it generally happens in such situations though that voters get confused and instinctively reject all the measures</s>
<s>this is why mr brown and his wife anne gust brown often described as his consigliere have been working desperately to keep all rival measures off the ballot</s>
<s>for instance and regrettably they persuaded a group proposing fundamental tax reform of the sort that california and america badly need to end its campaign</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that victory was supposed to clear the path for mr browns own plan</s>
<s>this aimed to slightly raise sales taxes for four years and income taxes on the affluent for a period of five years</s>
<s>the additional revenue—$7 billion a year on an optimistic calculation—would repair the overall budget and benefit schools in particular</s>
<s>by sprinkling but not soaking the rich and by cutting spending as well as raising taxes mr brown a democrat was hoping to appear moderate and to win approval</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>then the war began</s>
<s>it is a civil war since the foes are liberals on mr browns own side</s>
<s>one group the california federation of teachers the states secondlargest teachers union pushed a “millionaires tax”</s>
<s>taking its cues from the occupy movement it was aimed squarely at the rich</s>
<s>and unlike mr browns measure this one would raise their taxes permanently</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other campaign is more of a onewoman quest</s>
<s>molly munger is a rich civilrights lawyer who as a child chose to leave her private school for a state one and now considers it her mission to save public education</s>
<s>she also happens to be the daughter of warren buffetts partner at berkshire hathaway charles munger</s>
<s>and she seems willing to spend however much it takes to win</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ms mungers measure “our children our future” would raise the most $10 billion a year for 12 years</s>
<s>it would raise income taxes but target not only the rich</s>
<s>and it would earmark most of the new revenue for schools</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on march 14th mr brown apparently reached a deal with the millionaires tax camp</s>
<s>their new agreed proposal lessens mr browns proposed sales tax increase a bit but raises income taxes on the affluent more than he wanted</s>
<s>but that still leaves two proposals on the table</s>
<s>the teachers unions may now be on mr browns side but parents of schoolchildren insofar as they are organised by the powerful parentteacher association are with ms mungers</s>
<s>voters seem bewildered with different polls showing them favouring different permutations of the proposals on offer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is exactly what mr brown keeps warning about</s>
<s>his wife supposedly berated ms munger</s>
<s>mr brown though was more diplomatic visiting the rival teachers union boss at home and even letting his daughter interview him about animal euthanasia as part of her homework</s>
<s>but the other group of taxers are staying in the fight while the antitax republicans are grinning</s>
<s>as a brown adviser puts it speaking of fellow democrats “welcome to the circular firing squad”</s>
