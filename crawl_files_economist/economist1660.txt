<s>earlier this year barnet council closed a library in hampstead garden suburb citing a shortage of money</s>
<s>it was just an old shop with a collection heavy on romantic novels and childrens books</s>
<s>but local people were reluctant to see it go</s>
<s>in april the library was reopened by more than 70 volunteers</s>
<s>in this corner of north london the big society is thriving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the big society was david camerons big idea going into the 2010 general election</s>
<s>the conservative leader pledged to hand power to the people by boosting volunteering and local decisionmaking</s>
<s>it has since slipped from the policy front line</s>
<s>steve hilton a downing street adviser and a forceful proponent is on sabbatical in california</s>
<s>the big society tsar lord wei of shoreditch has left his post</s>
<s>opinion polls find that most people are bamboozled by the concept</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the attempt to devolve power formally to local communities is running out of steam according to the new local government network a thinktank</s>
<s>in may the residents of eight large cities were asked whether they wanted directlyelected mayors seven voted no</s>
<s>attempts to get charities more involved in delivering public services have stalled small groups find it hard to negotiate government contracts</s>
<s>yet volunteering the humble part of the big society ideal is thriving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the number of volunteer librarians has increased by over 70 in five years to 21642 in 2011 holding off many closures</s>
<s>youth clubs and community radio stations have also become dependent on wellintentioned folk as localauthority cash has dried up</s>
<s>a survey by the museums association finds that many local museums have cut staff and turned to volunteers in the past year</s>
<s>doit a volunteering website had 510000 applications to help in 2011 a 10 increase in one year</s>
<s>food banks have sprung up across the country to help the indigent</s>
<s>the olympics runs on an army of some 70000 volunteers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>few are happy about replacing paid staff with volunteers</s>
<s>they are splendid at greeting visitors often less splendid at applying for grants and other bureaucratic tasks</s>
<s>many are old although high youth unemployment is changing that</s>
<s>a surge in young volunteers has led the british red cross to provide more shortterm stints for those trying to burnish their cv and improve their chances of getting a job</s>

<p>
<s>nick hurd the civil society minister hopes to encourage dogooding more</s>
<s>he notes that 8 of volunteers contribute half of all volunteer hours and aims to broaden participation beyond this civic core</s>
<s>some 30000 teenagers will attend the new national citizen service volunteering camps this year</s>
<s>sensible reforms are being made criminal record checks required for people working with children and other vulnerable folk are to be made more portable for example</s>
<s>but so far government policy can be directly credited with little of the rise in volunteering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the things that have really boosted it are recession and austerity</s>
<s>according to the conservatives blueprint social action was supposed to follow from increased localism and the empowerment of communities</s>
<s>with a few exceptions this has not yet happened</s>
<s>instead recession has created more idle hands and cuts to valued local services have given those hands something to do</s>
<s>in practice the big society is a rescue mission</s>
<s>no wonder politicians do not talk about it much</s>
