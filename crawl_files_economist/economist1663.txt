<s>since floridas property market collapsed and its economy tanked hillsborough county has endured almost nonstop austerity</s>
<s>in the past five years the government of the county halfway up the states gulf coast has eliminated a quarter of its 6000 positions through attrition and layoffs</s>
<s>it has scaled back afterschool child care</s>
<s>workers pay has been frozen for three years</s>

<p>
<s>but the fiscal year that begins in october holds the prospect of relief</s>
<s>propertytax revenue is declining more slowly</s>
<s>tourismrelated taxes have stabilised</s>
<s>salestax revenue is actually up</s>
<s>there is still a deficit to be eliminated but it is a third of the size it was a year ago the county thinks it will need no layoffs next year</s>
<s>things arent getting better says tom fesler the countys budget director</s>
<s>“its more a function of just not getting worse”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such faint praise is not as damning as it seems there has been an awful lot of worse in the past few years</s>
<s>americas recovery may have officially begun in mid2009 but it has bogged down repeatedly since</s>
<s>that has in part been due to circumstances beyond american control such as rising oil prices and europes debt crisis</s>
<s>but it has also been due to the hangover of the recession consumers have been shedding debt lenders have been reluctant housing markets have been moribund and state and local governments like mr feslers have been cutting budgets in the face of prohibitions on deficits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some of those impediments have now gone away</s>
<s>economic and financial indicators released in the past few weeks portray a surprisingly chipper economy</s>
<s>in the three months to the end of february employers added 734000 jobs which is the best result since april 2006 if you exclude from past figures workers hired temporarily for the federal census</s>
<s>the unemployment rate has fallen by 07 percentage points since september to 83</s>
<s>and this is not just a matter of discouraged workers giving up the hunt for work</s>
<s>a broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and underused workers has fallen even further see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal reserve has been toying for months with plans for a new round of “quantitative easing”—the purchase of bonds with newly created money—as a way of stimulating demand</s>
<s>but at its meeting on march 13th it decided it didnt need the plans yet and upgraded its outlook for the economy which in january had been merely “modest” to “moderate”</s>
<s>that same day the stockmarket jumped to its highest since may 2008</s>
<s>it was helped both by good news on retail sales and by another announcement from the fed most major banks passed the stress tests that it had administered see article</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all things in moderation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>voters seem similarly uplifted</s>
<s>polls show approval for barack obamas handling of the economy growing steadily from august to february before slipping a little probably on the basis of high petrol prices</s>
<s>in part as a result he leads all the republican candidates in most hypothetical matchups although that means little eight months before an election</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is hardly the unshackling of a titan</s>
<s>as befits a recovery characterised by such fine gradations as the distinction between modest and moderate there are a lot of caveats</s>
<s>for one gross domestic product gdp does not look nearly as healthy as the jobs data imply</s>
<s>the drop in unemployment since august is on a scale that would normally be expected only if annualised growth were up to 5 according to ben herzon of macroeconomic advisers a consultancy</s>
<s>in fact gdp grew by only 3 annualised in the fourth quarter</s>
<s>it is tracking 12 in the current quarter</s>
<s>most economists still expect growth this year of only about 225</s>
<s>that is roughly the rate needed to keep unemployment stable it is not enough to reduce it further</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite not matching the gdp figures the recent employment numbers may nevertheless be accurate</s>
<s>it may be that firms simply cant squeeze more productivity from their workforce and are hiring to meet additional sales</s>
<s>or it may be that the gdp figures are wrong</s>
<s>subsequent revisions may show that gdp has been understated in the recovery rather as it was overstated during the recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a more pessimistic explanation is that the mild winter has temporarily boosted employment in construction and other weathersensitive industries allowing projects to keep going but not encouraging new ones to start</s>
<s>goldman sachs reckons this may explain 100000 jobs</s>
<s>another possibility according to jp morgan is that the size and timing of the 200709 recession threw off the process for ironing out seasonal fluctuations in the data</s>
<s>either explanation implies some of the current strength will be reversed later this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if the unemployment improvement is for real theres still the problem of circumstances beyond americas control</s>
<s>last years green shoots wilted when the loss of libyan oil production caused prices to spike japans earthquake and tsunami disrupted supply chains and europes sovereigndebt crisis worsened for the second year in a row</s>
<s>though as yet this year has seen no large natural disasters much of europe is in recession and the price of oil has risen to $126 a barrel as a result of disruptions to supply strengthening global demand and the showdown with iran</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neither factor helps but the impact does not as yet seem too bad</s>
<s>europes recession is proving to be shallower than expected</s>
<s>the rise in oil prices which matters more to the american economy than their level has been smaller than last year—when they were 33 higher than the year before</s>
<s>that is equivalent to prices going up to $145 this year which is unlikely unless tensions with iran get much worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the slow grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if adverse events elsewhere explain why gdp grew by only 17 last year they cannot explain why growth has averaged a mere 25 since mid2009</s>
<s>for that blame the drag that any economy in the aftermath of a financial crisis must suffer households and businesses are paying down or defaulting on old loans rather than taking out new ones to invest and spend banks are reluctant to lend because of depressed collateral values or regulatory scrutiny</s>
<s>monetary and fiscal stimulus can cushion the worst of these impacts but eventually conventional monetary policy reaches its limits and fiscal stimulus turns sometimes prematurely to austerity</s>
<s>underlying this is the reallocation of capital and labour from sectors that grew too fat in the boom years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these sources of drag are now diminishing</s>
<s>a year ago total bank loans were shrinking</s>
<s>now they are growing</s>
<s>loans to consumers have risen by 5 in the past year which has accompanied healthy gains in car sales see chart</s>
<s>mortgage lending was still contracting as of late 2011 but although house prices are still edging lower both sales and construction are rising</s>
<s>ed brady a builder in bloomington illinois has a $225000 fourbedroom model home that used to go a month or more between showings</s>
<s>during the second weekend of march it had seven or eight and mr brady expects to sell it soon he has already turned down one lowball offer</s>
<s>buyers he says are being driven by “pentup demand …and a little more optimism that they can sell their current house”</s>

<p>
<s>state and local governments are no longer as sorely afflicted by falling revenues</s>
<s>it has been something of a winter ritual for budget managers to warn that revenues are below target and spending above requiring midyear corrections to avoid a deficit</s>
<s>there too a bottom is in sight</s>
<s>at present just four states are reporting midyear budget gaps according to the national conference of state legislatures this time last year 15 did the year before that 36</s>
<s>state and local employment which declined by 655000 between august 2008 and last december—a fall of 33—has actually edged up since</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>back to basics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it could easily fall again states are not going to be quick to spend the revenues now starting to return</s>
<s>in texas where salestax revenues are running $1 billion ahead of projections the governor rick perry has rejected calls to reverse education cuts</s>
<s>and the realestate crash will reverberate for years through municipal coffers as property assessments and collections catch up with the collapse in values</s>
<s>last month stockton in california suspended paying interest on some bonds it may become the biggest municipal bankruptcy ever</s>
<s>meanwhile federal stimulus is steadily giving way to restraint</s>
<s>more drastic tightening looms at the end of the year if george bushs tax cuts already extended once expire and a “sequester” automatically slashes federal outlays</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beneath all this americas economy is slowly rebalancing itself</s>
<s>after living beyond its means for more than two decades america needs to export and invest more</s>
<s>changes in prices are one of the mechanisms that make that happen</s>
<s>just as lower property values drive capital and labour away from housing a lower dollar draws them to exports and industries that compete with imports</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>years of high oil prices are driving up fuel efficiency</s>
<s>they have also stimulated domestic supply in particular from unconventional sources like north dakotas bakken formation</s>
<s>as a result america is importing net 9m barrels of oil a day compared with 10m in 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>domestic oil and gas production have played a part in the recovery of manufacturing by spurring related exports</s>
<s>although a net importer of crude oil america was last year a net exporter of energy products such as petrol</s>
<s>cheap shale gas has revived the petrochemical industry which uses it to make ethylene—which in turn is used in everything from grocery bags to bottles and tyres</s>
<s>the american chemistry council an industry group reckons shale gas could generate 17000 jobs directly in the petrochemical industry and many more indirectly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>manufacturing employment which declined almost continuously from 1998 through 2009 has since risen by nearly 4 and the average length of time factories work is as high as at any time since 1945</s>
<s>since the end of the recession exports have risen by 39 much faster than overall gdp</s>
<s>neither is as impressive as it sounds manufacturing employment remains a smaller share of the private workforce than in 2007 and imports have recently grown even faster than exports as global growth has faltered and the dollar has climbed</s>
<s>trade which was a contributor to economic growth in the first years of recovery has lately been a drag</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but economic recovery doesnt have to wait for all of americas imbalances to be corrected</s>
<s>it only needs the process to advance far enough for the normal cyclical forces of employment income and spending to take hold</s>
<s>and though their grip may be tenuous and a shock might yet dislodge it it now seems that at last they have</s>
