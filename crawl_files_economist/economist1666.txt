<s>in 1951 jawaharlal nehru india’s first prime minister addressed a vast crowd on mumbai’s chowpatty beach</s>
<s>“if at all i am a beggar i am begging for your love” he said</s>
<s>politics has sunk rather low since then</s>
<s>on august 21st raj thackeray the city’s latest political star walked past a heavily policed crowd at chowpatty sporting the kind of sunglasses tom cruise wore in “top gun”</s>
<s>the nephew of a hitleradmiring excartoonist whose movement he has split from mr thackeray dislikes migrants and the government</s>
<s>following outbreaks of violence in the city the march was a show of muscle</s>
<s>for local youngsters without jobs he is his party manager says “a messiah”</s>

<p>
<s>it is emblematic of the decay of politics in mumbai and in maharashtra the state in which it sits</s>
<s>the decay is no mere curiosity</s>
<s>despite slums and poor roads mumbai has clung to its role as india’s new york—the commercial financial and creative capital</s>
<s>maharashtra remains by far the biggest cog in india’s economy see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the state’s lead is not a given</s>
<s>another 20 years of misrule—venal coalition politics delayed airports and roads slums and rural poverty—would be ruinous</s>
<s>and the collision that maharashtra has experienced for two decades of money migration and hereditary political power is one that much of india now faces</s>
<s>it is a test case can broken governance be fixed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the answer lies with prithviraj chavan chief minister since late 2010 for the congress party which heads the national ruling coalition but runs few big states</s>
<s>a technocrat he was parachuted in from delhi after his predecessor was named in a huge scam</s>
<s>mr chavan says “i don’t have a magic wand to do things overnight</s>
<s>but i can at least stop things going badly wrong” his priorities are to attack graft and boost infrastructure health care and schools</s>
<s>almost everyone agrees that he is clever able clean and sane—and worries that these are the wrong qualities for maharashtra</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>politics there is brutal</s>
<s>grubbier congress types dislike mr chavan and want to build a war chest for state and national elections due by 2014</s>
<s>he must also deal with a shifty coalition partner in the state assembly the ncp run by the pawar family</s>
<s>since 1999 the two parties have run the state together</s>
<s>their squabbles over patronage and more have delayed projects and gummed up decisions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a finely balanced assembly means individual legislators and the ncp can “cause havoc” an official says by threatening to defect</s>
<s>on september 25th the ncp’s ajit pawar the deputy chief minister resigned after corruption allegations</s>
<s>although the coalition is intact he may try to realign the ncp with other parties</s>
<s>the opposition includes the bjp a national party and two outfits run by the thackeray clan shiv sena and raj thackeray’s mns</s>
<s>both champion maharashtrians the state’s indigenes and their language marathi</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr chavan says the fractured polity carries huge costs</s>
<s>the problems run deep</s>
<s>first there is graft</s>
<s>it exploded along with mumbai’s property prices in the 1990s</s>
<s>illegal gains from using bribes to bend planning rules in the city run at perhaps $5 billion a year or 3 of state gdp</s>
<s>now a new alleged scam involves theft from irrigation projects under ncp control</s>
<s>if true this would be especially odious since the victims would be the rural poor</s>
<s>mr pawar the deputy who resigned denies all accusations</s>
<s>a businessman involved says simply “they are raping maharashtra”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a second problem is a fissure between the big cities and the countryside</s>
<s>since the 1960s mumbai’s marathispeakers who now comprise only a third of its residents have felt squeezed as outsiders many from uttar pradesh and bihar have piled in and englishspeakers have got plum jobs</s>
<s>that fuelled the rise of shiv sena which with the mns wins the urban marathispeaking vote</s>
<s>shiv sena has a thuggish past</s>
<s>now it welcomes anyone who opposes new migrants says its general secretary anil desai</s>
<s>given shiv sena’s urban clout it runs mumbai’s local council the other big parties look to the countryside for support where 55 of the state’s people live</s>
<s>the ncp’s heartland is a rural belt in the south and west</s>
<s>the result says kumar ketkar editor of dainik divya marathi a newspaper is that most parties do not care enough about the swelling cities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dynastic struggles add to the woes</s>
<s>the founders of the ncp and shiv sena are old</s>
<s>ajit pawar resigned partly to show independence from his uncle the ageing ncp strongman sharad pawar</s>
<s>raj thackeray split from shiv sena now run by his cousin to further his own ambitions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this drags down a vital state</s>
<s>what mr chavan can do about it is another matter</s>
<s>he is reluctant to confront his alliance partners despite their corruption and dynastic rivalries</s>
<s>a believer in due process he is accused of indecision</s>
<s>but he has pushed a few changes through</s>
<s>he has cleaned up the planning rules and kickstarted infrastructure projects such as a bridge from mumbai to the mainland</s>
<s>his fans in business and the bureaucracy want him to push harder</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet in the long run that would not solve much</s>
<s>by 2014 fresh state elections will be held</s>
<s>the omens from local council polls in february were poor for mr chavan—he made little impact</s>
<s>if congress loses to a new grouping or scrapes back in and fires its tooclean chief minister business will soon return to normal and maharashtra will resume its decline</s>
<s>the hope is that this technocrat can unleash his inner rabblerouser and appeal directly to the public</s>
<s>folk in maharashtra are looking for a messiah and mr chavan is the only sensible candidate around</s>
