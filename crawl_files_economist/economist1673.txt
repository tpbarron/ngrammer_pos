<s>in california where republicans wielding power have been hunted to extinction most political debates take place exclusively on the left</s>
<s>sometimes this works well enough</s>
<s>but on occasion it produces a spectacle of singular bloodiness</s>
<s>the row over proposition 30 a taxraising measure that the state’s voters will consider in november is one such case</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>prop 30 as it is universally known would temporarily lift the state’s sales tax by 025 percentage points and less temporarily but more vitally raise incometax rates on the wealthy</s>
<s>much of the $6 billion raised annually would be directed to schools and colleges going some way to repair the damage done by years of cuts</s>
<s>this week jerry brown the democratic governor stepped up his campaign for the measure with a tour of californian campuses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>speaking at ucla mr brown identified complacency as the enemy</s>
<s>a potentially more dangerous foe was left unnamed</s>
<s>mr brown has found himself up against molly munger a rich lawyer who is bankrolling an alternative ballot measure</s>
<s>proposition 38 would raise taxes further than prop 30 and send most of the revenues straight to schools bypassing the state government</s>
<s>if voters approve both the measure that secures most support will be enacted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that looks unlikely ms munger’s measure is struggling in the polls</s>
<s>prop 30 on the other hand was until recently winning the support of most voters</s>
<s>but then the gloves came off</s>
<s>television spots for prop 38 began claiming that if prop 30 passed politicians might find other uses for the revenues it raised</s>
<s>at around the same time one of ms munger’s brothers donated $10m to a committee devoted to among other things trashing prop 30</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under heavy fire this week ms munger’s campaign dropped its attack ad claiming gamely that it had made its point</s>
<s>it is too early to know if blood has been drawn but the most recent poll conducted before the ads were aired found support for prop 30 at just 495</s>
<s>the pollster california business roundtable said it expected that number to fall further</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is bad news for mr brown who has tied his political fortunes to his ballot measure</s>
<s>it is worse news for california’s schools and colleges for the revenues prop 30 would raise are baked into the budget mr brown pushed through the assembly in june</s>
<s>if it fails almost $6 billion will automatically be slashed from education budgets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>californians are already highly taxed but they prize education and mr brown’s guntothetemple tactic may yet see prop 30 through</s>
<s>some opponents suggest that even if it fails the triggercuts could be avoided by tweaking the budget after november</s>
<s>but mr brown has denied this so emphatically that it is hard to see him going back on his word</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to other critics mr brown has adopted the disarming posture of basically agreeing with them</s>
<s>yes there would have been better ways to plug the fiscal gap perhaps by slapping taxes on the extractive industries but alas that would galvanise too much opposition</s>
<s>regrettably prop 30 will worsen the state’s dependence on the volatile income of a small number of wealthy residents</s>
<s>but hey mr brown is a politician not a policy wonk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr brown still has cause for cheer</s>
<s>he has won backing from business groups and endorsements from most of california’s big newspapers mostly of the “hold your nose” variety</s>
<s>the campaign for prop 30 has raised far more money than the formal opposition has</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for the deeper question of why voters are being asked to rule on a matter that in most places would be reserved to legislators the short answer is that tax increases in california need a twothirds majority to pass—a threshold too high even in this democratic stronghold</s>
<s>the longer answer is that politics and tax policy have a uniquely destructive relationship in this state and that the fate of one piece of fiscal legislation will do little to change that</s>
