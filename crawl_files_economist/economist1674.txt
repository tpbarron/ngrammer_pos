<s>a shakeup of greeces cosy twoparty political system would hardly be a surprise given the economic and social upheaval caused by the countrys worst recession in almost a century</s>

<s>scaremongers claim that three leftwing parties—unreconstructed communists kke hardline radicals syriza and spendthrift socialists democratic left—are fomenting social unrest that could undermine greeces new bailout worth up to €174 billion $227 billion and drive it out of the euro</s>
<s>others worry about farright parties like golden dawn which for the first time is likely to beat the 3 threshold to enter parliament and laos</s>
<s>up to ten parties might win seats at the election</s>
