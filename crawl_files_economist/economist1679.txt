<s>outside the pub in the beacon park retirement village the motorised scooters wait</s>
<s>a cheerful crowd inside sings the praises of lichfield a small georgian city in the midlands</s>
<s>a lovely place to walk with good music in the cathedral says elizabeth trotman a poised 79yearold</s>
<s>good shops and an excellent library adds terrie kimberley who is 65</s>
<s>besides she says it is good to be near friends and family “you could be by the seaside and lonely”</s>

<s>in the 1970s retired britons began to cluster in seaside towns</s>
<s>such places were associated with leisure thanks to memories of family beach holidays</s>
<s>they had bingo parlours comfortable restaurants and bungalows</s>
<s>many seaside towns are still old</s>
<s>but the retired are moving</s>

<s>john shepherd a geographer at birkbeck a college of the university of london has collected demographic data on englands small towns</s>
<s>he finds that the retired populations of seaside settlements are now growing only slowly see map</s>
<s>a few coastal towns too large or too small to make mr shepherds list are actually losing old people including bournemouth in dorset salcombe in devon and southwold in suffolk</s>
<s>meanwhile small towns inland are filling up with retirees</s>

<s>i dont like to be beside the seaside</s>

<p>
<s>lichfield is about as far from the sea as it is possible to get in england</s>
<s>as the folks at beacon park attest it is extremely pretty with an elegant sandstone cathedral and appealing shops</s>
<s>thanks to a combination of inmigration and people not leaving when they retire the population of over65s in the district has increased from 14500 to 19600 since 2001</s>
<s>in that spell the old have accounted for more than 90 of lichfields net population growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>part of the reason for this shift is mathematical</s>
<s>many seaside towns are already old so it is hard for them to become much older</s>
<s>cost is another reason says danny dorling of sheffield university</s>
<s>coastal towns like aldeburgh and southwold in suffolk have become so fashionable that secondhome buyers with london jobs are pricing out retirees</s>
<s>but the most intriguing explanation is utility</s>
<s>increasingly the old simply prefer to live inland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many rapidlyageing small towns share a characteristic which mr shepherd calls “niceness”</s>
<s>they tend to have cathedrals</s>
<s>they are well kept and quiet with not too many students</s>
<s>by contrast many british seaside towns are rather decrepit</s>
<s>the generation now approaching retirement has seen nicer</s>
<s>“theyve been abroad</s>
<s>they have a different view of what a seaside place should be” says mr shepherd</s>

<p>
<s>the ageing of lichfield presents challenges to those who run it</s>
<s>since the death of an old woman in a fire the council has prodded social workers police and fire fighters to alert each other to the needs of the most vulnerable</s>
<s>more retirement homes are being built</s>
<s>older residents keep officials busy with complaints about behaviour they see as antisocial—including teenagers playing football</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the most part though local politics revolves around small changes to improve the quality of life in an older town according to nina dawes chief executive of lichfield council</s>
<s>a few years ago she says one street had “too much revelry” late at night</s>
<s>the council installed a taxi rank to take clubgoers home quickly and trimmed the hours of nearby takeaways</s>
<s>the greatest and most subtle challenge for a place like lichfield is the preservation of niceness</s>
