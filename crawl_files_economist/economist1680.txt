<s>the citystate of singapore likes to think of itself as squeaky clean so the prosecution of a priest no less for corruption has caused a furore</s>
<s>on july 25th kong hee pastor at city harvest church chc and five others appeared in court on charges of misusing up to s$50m $40m of church money to fund the music career of mr kong’s flamboyant wife sun ho</s>
<s>the case has divided singapore’s fastgrowing christian community which makes up about a fifth of the 5m population</s>
<s>it also worries those who see corruption as a growing problem</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the chc is singapore’s largest megachurch with more than 30000 members</s>
<s>ms ho helped to found the church and started singing as a way to broaden the church’s appeal skimpy outfits and provocative gyrations helped</s>
<s>a decade ago she became a fulltime pop singer</s>
<s>she has released several albums</s>
<s>her home is a mansion in hollywood hills california</s>

<p>
<s>mr kong’s detractors are smug after years of wailing about the evils and excesses of the new megachurches which they claim put entertainment before spirituality mammon before god</s>
<s>mr kong often prophesied that donations to the church would cause donors’ personal wealth to swell</s>
<s>such a “prosperity gospel” exploits the materialist aspirations of young singaporeans living in a society with more millionaires per head than almost any other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>church members have closed ranks claiming that they approve of their leaders’ spending chc’s building fund alone raised s$23m last year</s>
<s>they seem to have trusted mr kong to spend their money in any way he saw fit</s>
<s>local activists also acknowledge that the church contributes much to the wider community</s>
<s>still the case has revealed a lack of accountability and transparency at religious organisations</s>
<s>worshippers often place blind faith in their church leaders showing little interest in where their tithes and donations go</s>
