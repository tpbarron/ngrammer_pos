<s>inflation is creeping up around the globe</s>
<s>but in many countries ordinary folk as well as investment analysts suspect that governments are fiddling the figures for political reasons and that the true inflation rate is much higher than officially reported</s>
<s>argentinas inflation rate is the hardest to swallow</s>
<s>according to the government consumer prices rose by 109 in the year to december but privatesector economists estimate the true increase to be at least twice as much</s>
<s>in china too many claim that the governments figures hugely understate increases in the cost of living</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economists disagree on the best way to measure consumerprice inflation</s>
<s>how often should the relative weights be changed</s>
<s>how should one take account of quality improvements</s>
<s>one reason why the chinese may think their cost of living is rising so quickly is that consumers are moving upmarketâ€”for example from the local dumpling stand to a restaurant</s>
<s>that increases households spending but is not inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if you find the theory of price indices hard to digest why not rely on simple burgernomics</s>
<s>the economists big mac index was devised as a lighthearted gauge to whether currencies are under or overvalued but jonathan anderson an economist at ubs suggests that it can also be used to crosscheck official inflation rates</s>
<s>consisting of food materials wages and rent the mcdonalds big mac offers a handy consumerprice basket whose composition has hardly changed over time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we have compared prices late last year with those ten years earlier in a selection of countries</s>
<s>for example the price of a big mac in china rose by an annual average of 37 against the reported inflation rate of 23</s>
<s>is this evidence that the government is underreporting inflation</s>
<s>not necessarily the discrepancy is roughly the same as in america see chart</s>
<s>one might expect burger inflation to exceed overall inflation because food prices have risen faster than other prices</s>
<s>yet in russia and indonesia big mac prices rose by a lot less than the official price index possibly suggesting that the governments figures overstate inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however burgernomics does support claims that argentinas government is cooking the books</s>
<s>the gap between its average annual rate of burger inflation 19 and its official rate 10 is far bigger than in any other country</s>
<s>its government deserves a good grilling</s>
