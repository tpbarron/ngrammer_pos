<s>joaquÍn almunia has been in no rush</s>
<s>it is more than two years since googles competitors started complaining to him about the giant onlinesearch company</s>
<s>eighteen months ago mr almunia the european unions competition commissioner began a formal investigation</s>
<s>several times a decision has seemed imminent</s>
<s>on may 21st mr almunia said he wanted to get a move on</s>
<s>“i believe” he said “that these fastmoving markets would particularly benefit from a quick resolution”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr almunia did not present a formal case a “statement of objections” in eurospeak but offered google a chance to settle</s>
<s>he has four main areas of concern and wants the company to propose remedies to each “in a matter of weeks”</s>
<s>if he is not satisfied the formalities will resume</s>
<s>then he will impose his own answers and maybe a fine too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google is europes biggest search engine scooping about 85 of queries</s>
<s>in america its home country it scores a paltry twothirds see chart</s>
<s>mr almunia suspects that google abuses its dominant position</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his first concern is that google favours its own specialised searches—for restaurants or flights or comparing the prices of consumer goods—ahead of others</s>
<s>second he worries about its use of content such as restaurant or hotel reviews from competing specialists</s>
<s>google “may” he says be copying without permission</s>
<s>google thinks this has been resolved its competitors and the commission are not so sure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third mr almunia is vexed by exclusive agreements between google and other websiteowners such as magazine publishers or broadcasters</s>
<s>when users type entries into the sites search boxes google serves up the advertisements that appear alongside the results rival suppliers do not get a look in</s>
<s>fourth the commissioner is concerned that advertisers cannot easily transfer campaigns from googles adwords platform to rival systems</s>
<s>he thinks the terms of googles contracts with software developers may be to blame</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr almunias job is to protect consumers not googles rivals</s>
<s>to complicate matters people do not pay for search their clicks trigger payments by advertisers to google and its rivals</s>
<s>googles critics say that the unwitting clicker is losing out</s>
<s>if google pushes its rivals down its displays or snaffles their reviews so that users stay with its own services consumers may not get the best deals or information</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google replies that its software simply provides the most useful searches</s>
<s>if its own services come top so be it</s>
<s>even so it has been saying for a while that it is willing to talk a long fight after two years of skirmishing suits neither it nor the commission</s>
<s>now without paying too high a regulatory price it has to placate mr almunia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not only him</s>
<s>americas federal trade commission is also looking at claims that google unfairly favours its own services</s>
<s>the ftc means business last month it appointed beth wilkinson a lawyer who prosecuted timothy mcveigh the oklahoma city bomber to its google team</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regulators are not always beastly to google</s>
<s>on may 19th the firm said that china had followed america and the eu and approved its takeover of motorola mobility a maker of mobile phones whose main attraction is its 17000 patents</s>
<s>the deal worth $125 billion was completed on may 22nd</s>
<s>still on both sides of the atlantic google is in for a busy summer</s>
