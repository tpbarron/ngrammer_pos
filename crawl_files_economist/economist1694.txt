<s>wilkins micawber is an unlikely management thinker</s>

<s>the industry has endured a horrible five years</s>
<s>housing starts rallied a little in june but are still at historic lows see chart</s>
<s>prices continue to fall although there is huge variation between regions</s>

<s>eventually perhaps soon the market must obey mr micawbers dictum</s>
<s>prices have dipped below fair value according to the economists pricetorents ratio</s>
<s>homes are now affordable</s>
<s>the rate of household formation suppressed for years as people have put off renting or buying their own homes will bounce back few sane people want to live with their parents until theyre 40</s>
<s>a big bounce is unlikely credit for mortgages is hard to get and consumer confidence fragile</s>
<s>but rental markets are tightening and builders are already talking about inflection points</s>

<s>when prices fell the industry looked to its expenditure</s>
<s>most obviously firms hit payroll with a wrecking ball many reduced it by 7080</s>
<s>architects landbuyers and sales staff were shunted aside</s>
<s>land options were allowed to expire at the same time as signed contracts with homebuyers helped generate cash during the first years of the downturn</s>

<p>
<s>a less common tactic is to intervene directly in local markets</s>
<s>beazer homes has set up a “preowned homes” division to buy homes in phoenix arizona at distressed prices</s>

<p>
<s>the problem for builders is knowing which micawberism to follow how much cash to conserve and how much to invest in anticipation of recovery</s>
<s>the answer largely depends on location</s>
<s>jeff mezger the boss of kb home says that the firm has done 80 of its recent landbuying in coastal california and texas where demand is steadier than elsewhere</s>
<s>other markets are much less attractive</s>
<s>something will turn up but not all things at once</s>
