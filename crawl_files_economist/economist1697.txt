<s>the battered european left has a new champion</s>
<s>in slovakias election on march 10th robert ficos socialdemocratic party smer direction won 83 of the 150 seats</s>
<s>it is the first time a party has won a majority in slovakias postcommunist history</s>
<s>speaking in his office mr fico points proudly to an electric guitar signed by guns n roses an american rock band</s>
<s>their track “welcome to the jungle” is a fitting description of the task that faces the new prime minister</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>slovaks are in a grumpy mood</s>
<s>mr fico won his huge victory thanks partly to outrage over “gorilla” an intelligence report leaked in december which suggested that centreright politicians in a previous government may have been pocketing commissions from privatisation and publicprocurement deals</s>
<s>many of these figures had been celebrated for transforming slovakia from a laggard into one of central europes growth engines</s>
<s>heavyweights such as mikulas dzurinda of the christian democrats a former prime minister were once feted in brussels and washington</s>
<s>on election day they barely squeaked into parliament</s>
<s>mr dzurinda resigned as party leader after the election but denies any wrongdoing over gorilla</s>

<p>
<s>mr ficos first stint in office from 2006 to 2010 was marked by cronyism and an alliance with a nasty party of xenophobes</s>
<s>some fear his second will resemble the populism of viktor orban hungarys prime minister</s>
<s>but that seems unlikely</s>
<s>mr fico seems eager to shed his past reputation and to steer slovakia on to the path of economic reform</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it certainly needs it</s>
<s>growth prospects for 2012 are dim and unemployment hovers above the eu average</s>
<s>mr fico will be operating in harsh conditions under new eurozone rules the budget deficit will have to be cut from 5 of gdp last year to below 3 by 2013</s>
<s>this will mean finding savings worth €185 billion $242 billion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how to get there</s>
<s>the flagship policy of previous centreright governments the 19 flat tax on personal and corporate income looks certain to go</s>
<s>yet mr fico is unlikely to make a sharp left turn</s>
<s>marginal incometax rates will probably rise no higher than 25</s>
<s>corporate taxes will be set at 22 or 23</s>
<s>bank levies and publicprivate partnerships are being considered</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but these measures will do little to close the fiscal gap</s>
<s>economists at budget axe a website say mr fico can rake in €11 billion by raising the flat tax to 21 beefing up property and energy taxes and raising consumption taxes on alcohol and other goods</s>
<s>he may want to listen especially if he hopes to keep pensions and social benefits intact</s>
<s>iveta radicova the outgoing prime minister says that her successor has “genuine social empathy”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr fico talks the language of inclusion</s>
<s>he says he wants to involve everyone in the austerity debate</s>
<s>despite winning a majority he is keen to take a coalition partner if he can find one</s>
<s>to reassure voters sick of the stench of corruption he pledges to uphold the previous governments commitment to transparency although he has no plans to deal with what some see as a politicised judiciary</s>
<s>he mastered the art of opposition</s>
<s>the question is how well he can manage reform</s>
