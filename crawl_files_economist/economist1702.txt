<s>over the past few millennia the black sea port of constanta has faced many invaders and occupiers</s>
<s>but the romans avars and ottomans did not have to contend with the stefan cel mare a borderpatrol vessel equipped with surveillance radar thermalimaging cameras and a turret gun</s>
<s>on the bridge catalin paraschiv the cheerful skipper proudly shows off his craft as the sea ice melts outside</s>

<p>
<s>the stefan cel mare was built with european union funding to help romania meet the requirements for schengen the eus passportfree travel zone</s>
<s>some of the vessels 19man crew travelled to the netherlands to receive specialist training from damen the dutch firm that designed its specifications</s>
<s>but the dutch government has proved less helpful to the schengen ambitions of romania as well as those of bulgaria its southern neighbour</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dutch along with the rest of the eu accept that both countries have met schengens technical requirements</s>
<s>but they worry that sophisticated border machinery is of little avail if frontier officials are corrupt</s>
<s>the netherlands insists it will veto the pairs schengen bid until they do more to tackle graft</s>
<s>the frustrated bulgarians and romanians retort that the dutch government is in hock to the xenophobic hotheads that prop it up in parliament</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the row is tiresome and all sides are tired of it</s>
<s>most observers expect a deal later this year possibly in september just before a romanian general election</s>
<s>but if agreement comes it will be a triumph of impatience rather than of the eus fabled powers of transformation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over five years after bulgaria and romania joined the eu too early many in brussels think they remain by some distance its poorest members</s>
<s>progress on corruption and judicial reform has been slow</s>
<s>the eus “cooperation and verification mechanism” cvm—a supposedly temporary monitoring system put in place in 2007 to allay other countries concerns—is still in place</s>
<s>“we werent expecting it to take so long” says a jaded brussels official</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ministers in bucharest and sofia echo the weary mood</s>
<s>“the cvm led to a lot of improvements but now its time to turn the page” says leonard orban romanias europeanaffairs minister and the chief negotiator in accession talks</s>
<s>some think the eu should end the monitoring or measure progress differently</s>
<s>others say the effort is finally bearing fruit</s>
<s>monica macovei an mep and former romanian justice minister points to the rapid growth in convictions of senior figures in the last year alone</s>
<s>reformist officials value the spur of the eus reports</s>
<s>but eurocrats had not faced tests like romania and bulgaria before</s>
<s>their energy is ebbing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is a shame</s>
<s>european institutions are trusted in both countries and national politicians detested to an unusual degree</s>
<s>cvm reports make frontpage headlines</s>
<s>bulgarians favourite politician is kristalina georgieva their european commissioner</s>
<s>in many eu countries few citizens even know their commissioners name</s>
<s> when the eu froze funds to bulgaria in 2008 the government lost power a year later</s>
<s>in romania stronger laws and an independent anticorruption watchdog both with strong eu backing have dented crooked politicians impunity</s>
<s>the eu has performed “miracles” in romania says laura stefan of expert forum a thinktank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the eu continues to matter in bulgaria and romania partly because both countries feel distant from the eurozone crisis</s>
<s>having faced far direr emergencies in their past neither country has much sympathy for fiscal sinners such as greece where citizens are roughly three times as wealthy</s>
<s>“we are not a fan of countries that break rules” says nickolay mladenov bulgarias foreign minister adding that these have included germany and france</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neither country is a model of stability or economic governance</s>
<s>austerity protests in romania brought the collapse of the government in february and foreign investors find bulgaria steadily less friendly</s>
<s>but headline fiscal numbers are good</s>
<s>both countries have happily signed up to the germanbacked european compact placing legal limits on borrowing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one reason the schengen case has proved so vexing is that the two countries are learning to follow rules just as other countries have begun to mistrust them</s>
<s>in past years the pair would have sailed into schengen once they had done their homework</s>
<s>but now the mood in the core eu is of cranky distrust</s>
<s>this is partly because of the euro crisis those countries such as the netherlands and finland that have been the most sceptical about bailouts have taken the toughest line on schengen</s>
<s>in many cases populist parties have emerged to exploit anxiety over both issues</s>
<s>another fear is that letting bulgaria and romania into schengen would provide the many illegal immigrants in troubled greece with a passportfree land crossing to the rest of the eu see map</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the new mood in the core also reflects an increasing unhappiness with the eus variation in political cultures</s>
<s>bulgaria in particular has lately been receiving chilly ratings from brussels for persistent gangsterism and the erosion of media freedom</s>
<s>but others see the censure as unfair the new members problems were no secret when they applied to join</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the late 1990s as it became clear that europes excommunist countries were developing at radically different speeds some romanian officials said they feared being left in a geopolitical “grey zone” between russia and the west</s>
<s>accession to nato and the eu put those worries to rest</s>
<s>now they are reawakening</s>
<s>seen from romania or bulgaria the verdict is still positive a glance at dirtpoor moldova serves as a reminder of what life outside the eu can be like</s>
<s>but as the wrangle over schengen shows the richer half of europe increasingly sees things differently</s>
