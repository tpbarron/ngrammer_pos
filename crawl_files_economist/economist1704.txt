<s>europe has claimed the scalps of two leaders in almost as many days</s>
<s>first george papandreou the greek prime minister promised to resign and then italys silvio berlusconi did the same</s>
<s>both leaders have been in trouble for some time but the immediate cause of their downfall is plain the ultimatum they received from eurozone leaders at the g20 summit in cannes to reform their economies—or else</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr papandreou was instructed to approve the last european bailout deal or risk losing his loans and being ejected from the euro</s>
<s>he scrapped his call for a referendum and agreed on november 6th to make way for a government of national unity</s>
<s>with italys bond yields reaching danger levels mr berlusconi was told he lacked credibility and was made to “invite” the imf to supervise his reforms</s>
<s>on november 8th though mr berlusconi lost his majority in parliament and agreed to step down once the reforms are passed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two taboos were broken in cannes</s>
<s>it was the first time eurozone leaders accepted that a member could default and leave the euro</s>
<s>and once the unthinkable is possible why stop at greece</s>
<s> it was also the first time leaders intruded so deliberately into the internal politics of other countries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>true the european union has long influenced national politics</s>
<s>think of how conservative divisions over europe contributed to the resignation of britains margaret thatcher in 1990 or how new members have transformed themselves to join the eu or how italy reformed its public finances to qualify for the euro in 1999</s>
<s>in the past year the crisis has brought down the prime ministers of ireland and portugal after they needed to be bailed out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet something has changed</s>
<s>europeans see themselves as a family they have rows but nobody questions a members right to be part of the clan</s>
<s>but at cannes eurozone leaders made plain that family members could be forsaken even disinherited</s>
<s>some see this as an assault on national democracies by the european elite be it unelected or selfappointed as in the case of the germanfrench duo of “merkozy” angela merkel and nicolas sarkozy</s>
<s>much has been written about the subjugation of greece the cradle of democracy under a second german occupation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and much of it is nonsense</s>
<s>italy and greece chose freely to join the euro and every club has norms of behaviour</s>
<s>in a monetary union irresponsibility by one member endangers the wellbeing of others</s>
<s>if italy and greece had not been so overindebted and sclerotic they would not be in such trouble today</s>
<s>countries that extend financial help have a right to impose conditions to ensure that their loans are repaid</s>
<s>the alternative to eurozone diktat is being abandoned to the market</s>
<s>and if a response is needed it will inevitably be led by germany and france</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet there is something to the critics charges</s>
<s>for many countries such as spain the eu has been an anchor of democracy</s>
<s>but as the crisis persists austerity drags on and the euro zone integrates to save itself the legitimacy of the enterprise will suffer</s>
<s>the pain would be more acceptable if the creditors acted as if they believed they faced an existential threat</s>
<s>but rather than commit their full resources to the crisis they are seeking to limit their liability</s>
<s>this raises a sense of double standards one kind of democracy for creditors another for debtors</s>
<s>everybody must understand the constraints on mrs merkel</s>
<s>but mr papandreou commits a “breach of trust” if he calls a referendum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the debtors moreover bear the cost of the creditors mistakes</s>
<s>in greece the imf rightly wanted the adjustment programme to focus more on growthpromoting structural reforms the europeans prioritised deficitreduction</s>
<s>a deeperthanforecast recession means greece must chase everreceding fiscal targets with ever more austerity</s>
<s>its first bailout gave it threeyear loans at punitive interest rates with no debt reduction</s>
<s>the latest rescue offers greece cheap rates for up to 30 years with a 50 haircut on private bondholders</s>
<s>at least one of these options was wrong and neither may be enough to save greece</s>
<s>germany belatedly accepted the need for the rescue fund to be larger and more flexible</s>
<s>had all this been done sooner the crisis might have been contained more easily and at lower cost</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first fight the fire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>right now the emphasis needs to be on firefighting</s>
<s>italy is burning and the rest of the euro area could be consumed with it</s>
<s>decisions cannot be hostage to the vicissitudes of 17 national parliaments</s>
<s>and germany restraining the european central bank is like insisting that water buckets are used instead of fire engines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the longer term though the euro zone will need a new fire code</s>
<s>the eus treaties are likely to be reopened again</s>
<s>euro members will have to abide by stricter fiscal rules and accept intrusive inspection by outsiders</s>
<s>the loss of sovereignty would be more acceptable to debtors if the creditors were to accept the need eventually to issue joint eurobonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>independent institutions are needed to make the system work</s>
<s>most would prefer the unelected european commission over an intergovernmental body dominated by merkozy</s>
<s>the commission moreover would act as a vital link between the 17 euro “ins” and the ten noneuro “outs” preventing the sort of twospeed europe now openly advocated by france</s>
<s>more europe should not mean more sarkozy and less single market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>saving the euro requires more pain for some more generosity from others and fundamental change for all</s>
<s>is it worth it</s>
<s>sooner or later citizens must be asked</s>
<s>without their support no reform can last</s>
<s>and a real choice must include the option of leaving the euro</s>
<s>now that this taboo has been breached the euro zone should start thinking about how best to arrange the departure of those that cannot or will not live by germanic rules</s>
