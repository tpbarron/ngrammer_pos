<s>have hedge funds succeeded because of their investment genius or their crafty marketing</s>
<s>two new books disagree on whether the hedgefund managers golden chalice is halffull or halfempty</s>
<s>maneet ahuja a cnbc producer who worked briefly on wall street before taking a job at the wall street journal has written a homage to hedgies</s>
<s>she was in awe of wall street already when she was an intern at citigroup “i left the building with an offer for a semester internship in hand convinced i had found my calling with the good guys—good guys with nice shoes”</s>
<s>she has never shed it</s>

<s>throughout her book ms ahuja seems to be in a trance herself in thrall to the glamour of her subjects</s>
<s>she never questions the judgment of her alphamen and always gives them the last word</s>
<s>she devotes dozens of pages to mr paulsons rise in the hedgefund industry but glosses over his poor performance in 2011</s>
<s>his results have led some to speculate that he may have the unfortunate record of both earning and losing the most money in hedgefund history</s>
<s>she quotes one of his 2011 letters to investors asserting that bank stocks—whose struggles pulled down his funds performance—would rebound when the economy improves never criticising what he did or pointing out that investors will have to wait ages to claw back such massive losses</s>
<s>nor does she grasp at bigger themes or the many common factors that hedgefund managers share</s>
<s>is it ego courage good networks or charisma that has brought them more success than their fellow financiers</s>

<s>“the hedge fund mirage” attacks the wall street worshippers blind adulation</s>
<s>simon lack who spent 23 years at jpmorgan an investment bank selecting hedge funds to invest in grew tired of the free hand that investors all too often gave managers</s>
<s>he has written a provocative book questioning a central tenet of the hedgefund industry its performance is always worth paying for</s>
<s>the promise of superior performance is wrong he says</s>
<s>of course some investors make a killing but on average hedge funds have underperformed even riskfree treasury bills</s>
<s>this is because the bulk of investors capital has flooded in over the past ten years whereas hedge funds performed best when the industry was smaller than it is now</s>
<s>what is more it is hard to know how hedge funds actually fare since indices that track industry performance tend to overstate the returns</s>
<s>funds that do badly or implode are not usually included in the indices at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why would any client continue to pay for such mediocre returns</s>
<s>one reason is that hedgefund managers are incredibly good salesmen</s>
<s>in addition industry insiders who are all too aware of hedge funds shortcomings choose not to expose them mr lack argues</s>
<s>moreover the common fee structure in which hedgefund managers keep 2 of assets as a “management” fee to cover expenses and 20 of profits generated by performance has made many managers rich but not their clients</s>
<s>mr lack calculates that hedgefund managers have kept around 84 of profits generated with investors only getting 16 since 1998</s>
<s>“where are the customers yachts” is the title of one chapter</s>
<s>what is worse the disastrous dive of equity markets in 2008 may have wiped out all the profits that hedge funds have ever generated for investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr lack places a good deal of the blame for this on investors who fail to ask tough enough questions and have not grasped that they “want yesterdays returns without yesterdays risk”</s>
<s>they invest money with the biggest bestknown funds “that look nothing like those whose aggregate performance” they want to emulate</s>
<s>instead investors should stand up to managers negotiate more favourable terms and put their money into smaller funds which tend to perform better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr lack points out that large institutional investors always like to invest in bigger hedge funds</s>
<s>that way they need not worry about being the bulk of a small funds investorbase</s>
<s>but he offers no solution for these large investors who cannot put big sums into the small nimble funds that he touts</s>
<s>nor does he analyse how hedgefund performance compares with other asset classes such as private equity</s>
<s>as a result the reader is left with a nagging unanswered question would investors do better to avoid hedge funds altogether and if so where should they put their money in future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in his conclusion mr lack argues that most hedgefund books are written by their “proponents”</s>
<s>his ambition was to spark debate and help to change the industry</s>
<s>whether he succeeds or not remains to be seen</s>
<s>hedgefund executives have already reacted angrily to “the hedge fund mirage” which suggests that looking into the mirror may be painful</s>
<s>they rightly worry the days of easy praise are over</s>
