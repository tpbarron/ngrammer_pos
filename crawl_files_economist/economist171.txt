<s>a vast billboard at the airport near harare the capital depicts a motorway in rainbow hues stretching into the distance</s>
<s>this it says shows zimbabwe’s future of peace and democracy under a new constitution</s>
<s>signing up to such a document was part of a powersharing deal agreed in 2008 by president robert mugabe’s zanupf and morgan tsvangirai’s opposition movement for democratic change mdc</s>
<s>alas it has yet to happen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a referendum on the constitution has been repeatedly delayed as negotiations drag on</s>
<s>at a “stakeholder” conference in harare between october 21st and 23rd about 1200 delegates from the main political parties as well as the churches and civil society pondered the latest draft—still without agreement</s>
<s>the mdc says it is happy with the document</s>
<s>among other things the president would be limited to two terms</s>
<s>human rights would be better protected</s>
<s>an independent prosecuting authority would be created along with a new constitutional court separate from the supreme court now packed with mr mugabe’s allies</s>
<s>some power would shift from president to parliament</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>zanupf rejects this saying the draft puts too many constraints on the government</s>
<s>it knows that without a referendum on the constitution an election expected next year will have to be held under the old system</s>
<s>that gives mr mugabe’s lot a better chance of winning by hook or by crook</s>
<s>the voters’ roll is still crammed with the names of children and the dead</s>
<s>the mdc faces intimidation in rural areas</s>
<s>activists have little confidence that the electoral commission is independent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still the mdc is hopeful that voting would be less bloody than last time when at least 200 people died forcing mr tsvangirai to abandon a presidential runoff despite beating mr mugabe in the first round</s>
<s>jameson timba an mdc minister does not rule out the possibility of violence but thinks it will not be on the same scale</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in any event zanupf has been heartened by a recent poll that suggests it may be clawing back popular support</s>
<s>research by freedom house a campaigning americabased thinktank and the local mass public opinion institute suggests 31 of zimbabweans would back zanupf in elections up from just 12 in 2009</s>
<s>only a fifth said they backed the mdc down from more than half three years ago</s>
<s>but over 40 refused to say who they would vote for and twothirds admitted that fear of violence and intimidation could influence voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another rival poll by afrobarometer another independent research body also showed the mdc to be flagging but put much more weight on the fear factor</s>
<s>according to afrobarometer’s calculations if waverers and the cagey don’tknows were removed the mdc would still beat zanupf by 58 to 34</s>
