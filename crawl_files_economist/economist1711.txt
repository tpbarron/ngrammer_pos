<s>latin america is rich in soughtafter commodities including narcotics</s>
<s>the coca leaf from which cocaine is refined is grown only in the foothills of the andes</s>
<s>mexico produces more heroin than anywhere but afghanistan as well as much cannabis</s>
<s>latin american traffickers are even diversifying into synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the illegality of this successful export business means that its multibilliondollar profits go to criminal gangs</s>
<s>their battles for market control have a high cost according to the un eight of the worlds ten most violent countries are in latin america or the caribbean</s>
<s>drugs are not the only business of organised crime but they account for the bulk of the gangs income and thus their firepower</s>
<s>honduras a strategic spot on the trafficking route has the worlds highest murder rate about 80 times that of western europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this is despite three decades of what has become known as the “war” on drugs in the region inspired by the united states and prosecuted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by latin american governments</s>
<s>or is it because of the drug war</s>
<s>hitherto criticism of drug prohibition has tended to come only from retired political leaders</s>
<s>in a 2009 report three respected former presidents fernando henrique cardoso of brazil césar gaviria of colombia and mexicos ernesto zedillo declared the drug war a failure and demanded alternative approaches</s>
<s>mr cardoso has called for the legalisation of some drugs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>recently sitting presidents have begun to speak up too</s>
<s>felipe calderón of mexico called for a “national debate” about legalisation though he then seemed to forget about it</s>
<s>after an arson attack by a drug gang killed 52 people in a casino last august he declared that if the united states was determined to keep importing drugs it should seek “market alternatives” and “clear points of access other than the border with mexico”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in november juan manuel santos colombias president told britains observer newspaper “if taking away traffickers profits means legalising and the world thinks thats the solution i will welcome it” the seven countries of central america plus mexico colombia and the dominican republic have jointly declared that “if cutting demand is not possible as recent experience demonstrates the authorities of consumer countries must explore all possible alternatives…including regulatory or market options”</s>

<p>
<s>those calling for an end to the war cannot all be brushed off as liberal nambypambies</s>
<s>otto pérez molina guatemalas new president is a former general who when campaigning promised an “iron fist” against crime</s>
<s>last month he called for the decriminalisation of drugtrafficking saying “you would get rid of moneylaundering smuggling armstrafficking and corruption” in a poll for el periódico a guatemalan newspaper 79 were against decriminalising drugs</s>
<s>but mr pérez who enjoys voters confidence on security has pressed on sending his vicepresident on a regional tour to drum up support</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the united states seems to have noted this warweariness</s>
<s>during a visit to mexico and honduras earlier this month joe biden the vicepresident said that legalisation was “worth discussing” but added that there was no possibility of the administration dropping its opposition to it</s>
<s>his call to stand firm was undermined by the announcement that funding from the united states for central american security would be cut to $105m this year from an average of $120m over the past three years</s>
<s>without more money the region has no hope of containing its criminal mafias</s>
<s>the crash of a military helicopter in guatemala last month left only two operational nextdoor belize has none</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some wonder if the talk about legalisation is a ploy to extract more foreign aid</s>
<s>mr pérez for instance wants the united states to restart aid to the guatemalan army banned because of past humanrights abuses</s>
<s>mr calderón whose party faces an uphill struggle in julys presidential election has often sought scapegoats for what many mexicans see as the failure of his fiveyear war against the traffickers</s>

<p>
<s>some latin american countries like some in europe take a softer approach to drug consumption than the united states focusing on education and treatment</s>
<s>several allow possession of small personal doses of drugs</s>
<s>in brazil drug users are sentenced to community work rather than prison</s>
<s>the countrys supreme court is due to rule this year on whether drug consumption should be decriminalised</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the difficulty for many latin american countries is that short of legalisation it is hard to replicate such “harm reduction” policies when it comes to drug production and transport</s>
<s>it is prohibition which provides the profits that attract organised crime</s>
<s>take bolivia which last year left the 1961 un convention on narcotics control because it wants legal protection for the traditional use of coca leaves which are chewed by amerindians and drunk as tea</s>
<s>on march 12th bolivias president evo morales who doubles as the leader of the coca workers union brandished a coca leaf at the annual meeting of the un commission on drugs in vienna urging that his country be readmitted to the convention with an optout for coca</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr morales has raised the permitted amount of coca for traditional use from 12000 hectares 29500 acres to 20000 pending a study of how much is actually required</s>
<s>foreign officials believe the increase is unwarranted</s>
<s>most coca in bolivia 31000 hectares in total is turned into cocaine for export mainly to brazil where the cities are suffering a crack epidemic</s>
<s>after mr morales expelled the us drug enforcement administration brazils federal police have stepped up antidrug operations with their bolivian counterparts</s>

<p>
<s>peru has replaced colombia as the largest cocaine exporter</s>
<s>after ollanta humala became perus president last july his first antidrugs chief ricardo soberón a former activist in ngos announced a surprise suspension of cocaeradication efforts but without putting any other policies in place</s>
