<s>there is no love lost between alawite and sunni quarters of tripoli lebanons secondlargest city</s>
<s>it lies just half an hour by car from the border with syria where violence increasingly pits the sects against each other</s>
<s>here bullets have often flown across the road that divides them the aptly named syria street</s>
<s>in february tripolis gun battles left three dead and provoked the army to intervene</s>
<s>yet now cooler heads seem to be prevailing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>alawites an esoteric offshoot of shia islam are far rarer in lebanon than in syria where they account for 12 of the population but dominate the regime</s>
<s>in jebel mohsen their tripoli stronghold pictures of the syrian president bashar assad adorn walls and doors</s>
<s>not surprisingly since he as a powerful alawite is seen as something of a godfather</s>
<s>yet a local furnituremaker says residents are not personally attached to mr assad “we have no problem with a different leader as long as we stay protected”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lebanons sunnis are noisier but appear no more keen on conflict</s>
<s>their main figurehead saad hariri a former prime minister has accused mr assad of leading a murderous campaign against his own people</s>
<s>but for all the bluster there is little sign that the sunnis who make up a third of lebanons people are sending large amounts of money or weapons to the syrian opposition</s>
<s>for one thing lebanons sunnis are badly organised divided by class and region and are themselves relatively poorly armed compared with hizbullah the powerful shia partycummilitia</s>
<s>“scars of the civil war run deep” says a bushybearded sheikhcumbusinessman in tripoli recalling lebanons own vicious bloodletting of 197590</s>
<s>“and peace is better than war for making money”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>likewise hizbullah is playing a careful game</s>
<s>despite its reliance on syria as the main conduit to its generous patron and sponsor iran and despite its strong position within lebanon the shia group denies sending forces to help mr assad</s>
<s>it has tried to keep lebanons fragile government together toning down for instance its vitriol against an international tribunal that accuses its members of killing mr hariris father rafik five times prime minister with a car bomb in 2005</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hizbullah is aware that its rhetorical support for mr assad has put it in a bind</s>
<s>a pervasive ethos in political shia islam of championing victims of oppression sits uneasily with backing a notably brutal regime drawn largely from the shiainfluenced alawite sect</s>
<s>its leaders have drawn criticism for suggesting that lebanon should not accept syrian refugees</s>
<s>the party remains popular among shias and also among many lebanese christians who share a doomladen view of syrias troubles fearing a replacement of its secular regime by an islamist government reflecting the fact that some 75 of syrians are sunni muslims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but shia discomfort is growing</s>
<s>ali a student from the town of aitaroun near the israeli border rejects the notion that southerners who are mainly shia automatically follow hizbullah</s>
<s>he thinks the partys leaders have manipulated its supporters</s>
<s>“it is not right to put the shia in conflict with the syrian people” he says</s>
<s>but among hizbullahs popular support base such voices remain rare</s>
<s>for all the tensions the fear of a sunni resurgence in the deeply divided region still trumps sympathy for syrias battered protesters</s>
