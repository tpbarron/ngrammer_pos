<s>telecommuters fall into two camps</s>
<s>some slouch on the sofa watching daytime soaps pausing occasionally to check their blackberrys</s>
<s>most however do real work undistracted by meetings and gasbag colleagues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the future more people will work from home</s>
<s>with office space in london and new york so costly many firms save money by encouraging staff to work in their pyjamas</s>
<s>instead of having to bury their noses in strangers’ armpits on crowded trains they can work via email skype and virtual private networks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet daniel cable of the london business school finds that companies still reward presenteeism</s>
<s>in research published in mit sloan management review he shows that telecommuters are less likely to be promoted</s>
<s>in one experiment subjects were asked to judge scenarios in which the only difference was whether the employee was at his office desk or at home</s>
<s>managers rated those at the office to be more dependable and industrious regardless of the quality of their work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>visibility creates the illusion of value</s>
<s>being the last to leave the office impresses bosses even if you are actually larking around on facebook</s>
<s>oddly this holds true at firms that explicitly encourage staff to work from home</s>
<s>mr cable studied attitudes at californian tech firms</s>
<s>many asked employees not to come to the office too often yet bosses unconsciously penalised those who obeyed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>remote workers understand this</s>
<s>many barrage their bosses with progress reports to prove they are on the job</s>
<s>a fifth of the workers in the study admitted to leaving a canny email or voicemail early or late in the day</s>
<s>still many are not as smart as they think</s>
<s>some choose a monday or friday to work at home</s>
<s>that says mr cable makes others think they are keen to extend the weekend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a culture of presenteeism hurts working mothers most</s>
<s>many women and some men work from home to allow themselves the flexibility to pick up kids from school</s>
<s>that need not mean they produce less only that they do it at a time and a place of their own choosing</s>
<s>some firms such as best buy an electronics retailer recognise this and try hard to evaluate staff solely on performance</s>
<s>but this is not easy</s>
<s>intangibles such as teamworking skills matter too</s>
<s>mr cable thinks homeworking will lose its stigma only when most people do it</s>
<s>or perhaps when the boss—like the editor of this article—is telecommuting too</s>
