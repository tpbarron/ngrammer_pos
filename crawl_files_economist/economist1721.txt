<s>it is sadly appropriate that mohamad bouazizi the tunisian whose selfimmolation triggered the first protest of the arab spring should have been a street vendor selling food</s>
<s>from the start food has played a bigger role in the upheavals than most people realise</s>
<s>now the arab spring is making food problems worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they start with a peculiarity of the region the middle east and north africa depend more on imported food than anywhere else</s>
<s>most arab countries buy half of what they eat from abroad and between 2007 and 2010 cereal imports to the region rose 13 to 66m tonnes</s>
<s>because they import so much arab countries suck in food inflation when world prices rise</s>
<s>in 200708 they spiked with some staple crops doubling in price</s>
<s>in egypt local food prices rose 37 in 200810</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unsurprisingly the spike triggered a wave of bread riots</s>
<s>bahrain yemen jordan egypt and morocco saw demonstrations about food in 2008</s>
<s>they all suffered political uprisings three years later</s>
<s>the arab spring was obviously about much more than food</s>
<s>but it played a role</s>
<s>“the foodprice spike was the final nail in the coffin for regimes that were failing to deliver on their side of the social contract” says jane harrigan of londons school of oriental and african studies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if governments had done nothing food inflation would have pushed up public spending because most arab states offset high world prices to keep food cheap in local terms</s>
<s>the cost of such policies is high</s>
<s>food subsidies eat up some 4 of egypts budget morocco boosted spending on fuel and food subsidies to $5 billion this year</s>
<s>in reaction to the riots most arab countries increased their subsidies</s>
<s>kuwait for example is providing free staple food to everyone for 14 months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these subsidies are having perverse effects</s>
<s>according to the gallup world poll between a half and threequarters of arab populations say they are dissatisfied with their governments povertyreduction efforts</s>
<s>and cheap calories are bad for peoples health</s>
<s>arab countries are seeing some of the biggest increases in obesity in the world</s>
<s>about 30 of egyptian adults and 35 of jordanians are obese</s>
<s>most of all subsidies are unaffordable at least for oil importers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so the need for reform is growing</s>
<s>because subsidies are not targeted they are inefficient</s>
<s>egyptians use cheap bread as animal feed</s>
<s>since the poorest 40 get less than 40 of the spending on cheap bread the middle classes are capturing more than their fair share of benefits</s>
<s>a new study by the international food policy research institute a thinktank in washington dc argues that targeting rather than blanket subsidies would reduce spending while protecting the poor</s>
<s>but governments are unwilling to take the political risks of cutting middleclass subsidies</s>

<s>“i was a smallholder in the jordan valley near the dead sea” says amjad toukan of the lebanese american university in beirut</s>
<s>“but i couldnt get water without bribing local bureaucrats while middlemen were taking an excessive amount of what i made</s>
<s>so i became an economics professor” arab agriculture would benefit from taking his lessons</s>
