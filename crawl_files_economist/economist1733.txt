<s>cool a mixture of natural gas and water down to its freezing point and the result is an icy material called methane hydrate</s>
<s>visionaries see this substance which is common in the depths of the ocean as a novel source of fossil fuel</s>
<s>oil companies however have a less rosy view of it at least in the short term</s>
<s>the reason is that one place in the ocean depths where methane hydrate forms all too frequently is inside pipes carrying oil from undersea wells to rigs at the surface</s>
<s>like plaque in arteries this accumulation restricts the flow of fluid and sometimes blocks things up completely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one way to keep the oil flowing is to heat the pipe</s>
<s>that though is costly</s>
<s>another is to pump antifreeze in the form of methanol down it from time to time</s>
<s>but methanol is toxic so this creates an environmental hazard</s>
<s>kripa varanasi and his colleagues at the massachusetts institute of technology however think they have found a third way</s>
<s>as they describe in physical chemistry chemical physics they propose to make the pipes interiors so slippery that methane hydrate will be unable to stick to them in the first place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr varanasis day job is developing waterrepelling compounds that can be painted on to things like aeroplane wings in order to stop them becoming covered with ice</s>
<s>it is not far from that to stopping hydrate accumulating inside oil pipes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to find a suitable substance with which to coat the pipes dr varanasis team built a piece of apparatus that looks a bit like an organ</s>
<s>it is a series of glass tubes each open at one end that are filled with hydraterich slush</s>
<s>because of methane hydrates propensity to catch fire the team used tetrahydrofuran hydrate which has similar physical properties instead</s>
<s> the open end of each tube is pressed against a steel plate that has been coated with a series of chemical mixtures that the researchers wish to test</s>
<s>different tubes abut different molecular combinations</s>
<s>the whole apparatus is then cooled to 15Â°c for two hours to mimic conditions in the deep ocean after which the tubes are broken off the steel plate one by one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the crucial point is that the act of breaking is precisely controlled and the force required accurately measured while it is going on</s>
<s>the amount of force needed shows how well stuck the tube was and thus how well each chemical mixture on the steel repells the hydrate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr varanasi and his colleagues tried ten promising chemical cocktails</s>
<s>the winner was an 8020 mixture of polyethyl methacrylate and fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane</s>
<s>so little force was needed to dislodge the tube that dr varanasi thinks the mere movement of oil inside a pipe coated with it would be enough to keep that pipe clear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whether the process will work in practice remains to be seen</s>
<s>not least experiments will now need to be carried out with real methane hydrate instead of a substitute</s>
<s>but it looks promising</s>
<s>and if it does work it will be one of those incremental advances important but often unnoticed and unreported that help the world in both a literal and a figurative sense to run more smoothly</s>
