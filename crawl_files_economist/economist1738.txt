<s>stricken by fears of a looming greek exit the euro zone has at least dodged a doubledip recession</s>
<s>yet gdp stagnated in the first quarter after a fall late last year</s>
<s>and that uninspiring outcome which leaves output unchanged on a year ago owed much to an unexpectedly strong german economy</s>
<s>the hope is that germany which produces over a quarter of eurozone output can pull along the rest</s>
<s>but the worry is that the latest bout of euro sickness may sap confidence even in germany aborting a broader recovery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the gdp figures for the first quarter laid bare a widening divide between north and south see chart</s>
<s>although the netherlands fell and france stagnated germany whose economy had contracted by 02 in late 2011 bounced back with growth of 05 an annualised rate of 21</s>
<s>by contrast italy and spain the third and fourthbiggest economies ran up declines of a shocking 08 and 03 respectively</s>
<s>the latest european commission forecasts suggest that a german recovery will eventually drag the euro zone out of trouble</s>
<s>they show german gdp in 2012 growing by 07</s>
<s>eurozone output will still fall by 03 but it should grow by 1 in 2013 spurred by german growth of 17</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if germany can sustain its strong performance these forecasts may be too pessimistic</s>
<s>german resilience reflects several strengths</s>
<s>although growth in the first quarter was helped by exports the usual mainstay it has increasingly been backed by domestic demand which accounted for threequarters of gdp growth in 2011</s>
<s>this reorientation has happened because germany avoided the debt excesses both private and public that inhibit growth elsewhere</s>
<s>with relatively low debt german households and firms can borrow more</s>
<s>what is more they can do it at rockbottom rates</s>
<s>paradoxically germany is benefiting from the euro crisis as investors seek a haven</s>
<s>yields on tenyear german government bonds have fallen below 15</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>looser monetary conditions are thawing the property market after a long freeze</s>
<s>consumers are spending more as higher pay settlements swell wage packets</s>
<s>with unemployment at 6 compared with a 15year high of 11 across the euro zone and over 20 in spain and greece germans feel less pressure to save in case they lose their jobs</s>
<s>and a more confident germany helps everyone by spending more on imports</s>
<s>german inflation at 22 is now below average it will rise above as the average falls helping weaker european economies to regain competitiveness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although this rebalancing is needed it will upset germans who are neuralgic about inflation</s>
<s>one worry is that the bundesbank might use national tools eg raising bankcapital requirements to restrain inflation</s>
<s>but jens ulbrich head of the bundesbanks economic department has told the bundestag that germany is likely to have higher inflation than the rest of the euro zone</s>
<s>wolfgang sch√§uble the finance minister says inflation between 2 and 3 would be acceptable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in practice german inflation may have to be higher still for rebalancing to work</s>
<s>but a more important snag is the renewed loss of confidence as the euro crisis worsens</s>
<s>surveys for april suggest that the eurozone economy remains weak</s>
<s>the new uncertainty may hold back investment and make consumers more cautious even in germany</s>
<s>greece may account for only 2 of eurozone gdp but it is shaking everybody by calling into doubt the currencys supposed irrevocability</s>
