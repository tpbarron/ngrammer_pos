<s>in the early afternoon of august 18th 2008 a reconnaissance unit of about 100 french paratroopers accompanied by a small number of afghan and american soldiers was ambushed by a similarly sized taliban force in the uzbin valley not far from kabul</s>
<s>ten french soldiers were killed in fighting that continued into the night—frances biggest loss since it sent soldiers to afghanistan in 2002</s>
<s>but it might have been avoided had the unit had a single aerialrobot scout says gérard de boisboissel a specialist on military robots at the french armys saintcyr military academy</s>
<s>that assessment shared by many led to a retooling of frances armed forces</s>
<s>today drones also called unmanned aerial vehicles uavs routinely accompany even small french units</s>

<s>more broadly fighting forces and intelligence services worldwide are equipping themselves with all manner of robots that operate on land and sea and in the air</s>
<s>the conduct of war is being transformed—and largely it seems to the wests advantage</s>
<s>but knotty ethical quandaries are cropping up as the mechanical guts electronic sensors and digital brains of robots continue to improve</s>
<s>some fear that robots which are ingeniously mobile and can collect and process huge quantities of data make it too easy to launch attacks</s>
<s>others worry whether robots can be trusted to make their own decisions while in combat</s>

<s>military robots come in an astonishing range of shapes and sizes</s>
<s>delfly a dragonflyshaped surveillance drone built at the delft university of technology in the netherlands weighs less than a gold wedding ring camera included</s>
<s>at the other end of the scale is americas biggest and fastest drone the $15m avenger the first of which recently began testing in afghanistan</s>
<s>it uses a jet engine to carry up to 27 tonnes of bombs sensors and other types of payload at more than 740kph 460mph</s>

<p>
<s>on the ground robots range from trucksized to tiny</s>
<s>terramax a robotics kit made by oshkosh defense based in wisconsin turns military lorries or armoured vehicles into remotely controlled or autonomous machines</s>

<s>by jabbing the ground with a gaspowered piston the sand flea can leap through a window or onto a roof nine metres up</s>
<s>gyrostabilisers provide smooth inair filming and landings</s>
<s>the 5kg robot then rolls along on wheels until another hop is needed—to jump up some stairs perhaps or to a rooftop across the street</s>
<s>another robot rise resembles a giant cockroach and uses six legs tipped with short velcrolike spikes to climb coarse walls</s>
<s>biggest of all is the ls3 pictured above a fourlegged doglike robot that uses computer vision to trot behind a human over rough terrain carrying more than 180kg of supplies</s>
<s>the firm says it could be deployed within three years</s>

<p>
<s>demand for land robots also known as unmanned ground vehicles ugvs began to pick up a decade ago after americanled forces knocked the taliban from power in afghanistan</s>
<s>soldiers hunting osama bin laden and his alqaeda fighters in the hindu kush were keen to send robot scouts into caves first</s>
<s>remotecontrolled ground robots then proved enormously helpful in the discovery and removal of makeshift roadside bombs in afghanistan iraq and elsewhere</s>
<s>visiongain a research firm reckons a total of $689m will be spent on ground robots this year</s>
<s>the ten biggest buyers in descending order are america followed by israel a distant second and britain germany china south korea singapore australia france and canada</s>

<s>robots capabilities have steadily improved</s>
<s>upload a mugshot into an sugv a briefcasesized robot than runs on caterpillar tracks and it can identify a man walking in a crowd and follow him</s>
<s>its maker irobot another mit spinout is best known for its robot vacuum cleaners</s>
<s>its latest military robot firstlook is a smaller device that also runs on tracks</s>
<s>equipped with four cameras it is designed to be thrown through windows or over walls</s>

<s>another throwable reconnaissance robot the scout xt throwbot made by recon robotics based in edina minnesota was one of the stars of the ground robotics capabilities conference held in san diego in march</s>
<s>shaped like a twoheaded hammer with wheels on each head the scout xt has the heft of a grenade and can be thrown through glass windows</s>
<s>wheel spikes provide traction on steep or rocky surfaces</s>
<s>in february the us army ordered 1100 scout xts for $139m</s>
<s>another version being developed with the us navy can be taken to a ship inside a small aquatic robot and will use magnetic wheels to climb up the hull and onto the deck says alan bignall recons boss</s>

<p>
<s>even more exotic designs are in development</s>
<s>darpa the research arm of americas department of defence is funding the development of small soft robots that move like jerky slithering blobs</s>
<s>eatr another darpa project is a foraging robot that gathers leaves and wood for fuel and then burns it to generate electricity</s>
<s>researchers at italys santanna school of advanced studies in pisa have designed a snakelike aquatic robot</s>
<s>and a small helicopter drone called the pelican designed by german and american companies could remain aloft for weeks powered by energy from a groundbased laser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this technology may not always provide a meaningful advantage</s>
<s>this year the us marine corps will start testing boston dynamicss fourlegged beast of burden the ls3</s>
<s>its elaborate design keeps it upright even on rocky ground and it is very difficult to knock over</s>
<s>but its petrol engine makes it as loud as a lawnmower</s>
<s>the taliban have a much stealthier system notes a former french army lieutenant</s>
<s>their mules quietly eat grass</s>

<p>
<s>a larger worry is that countries with highperformance military robots may be more inclined to launch attacks</s>
<s>robots protect soldiers and improve their odds of success</s>
<s>using drones sidesteps the tricky politics of putting boots on foreign soil</s>
<s>in the past eight years drone strikes by americas central intelligence agency cia have killed more than 2400 people in pakistan including 479 civilians according to the bureau for investigative journalism in london</s>
<s>technological progress appears to have contributed to an increase in the frequency of strikes</s>
<s>in 2005 cia drones struck targets in pakistan three times last year there were 76 strikes there</s>
<s>do armed robots make killing too easy</s>

<s>not necessarily</s>
<s>when mary cummings a former us navy pilot stopped flying f18 fighter jets in 1997 there were no video links between cockpits and command centres and even radio contact was patchy at times</s>
<s>as a result pilots often made their own calls on whether or not to strike</s>
<s>todays drones blimps unmanned boats and reconnaissance robots collect and transmit so much data she says that western countries now practise “warfare by committee”</s>
<s>government lawyers and others in operation rooms monitor video feeds from robots to call off strikes that are illegal or would “look bad on cnn” says ms cummings who is now a robotics researcher at mit</s>
<s>and unlike pilots at the scene these remote observers are unaffected by the physical toil of flying a jet or the adrenalin rush of combat</s>

<s>in march britains royal artillery began buying robotic missiles designed by mbda a french company</s>
<s>the fire shadow is a “loitering munition” capable of travelling 100km more than twice the maximum range of a traditional artillery shell</s>
<s>it can circle in the sky for hours using sensors to track even a moving target</s>
<s>a human operator viewing a video feed then issues an instruction to attack fly elsewhere to find a better target or abort the mission by destroying itself</s>
<s>but bypassing the human operator to automate attacks would be technologically in the “realm of feasibility” an mbda spokesman says</s>

<s>could the “man in the loop” be removed from robotic weapons</s>
<s>the israel defence forces have installed “combat proven” robot machineguns along the countrys borders</s>
<s>when sensors detect an intruder the barrel pivots to follow him</s>
<s>a human soldier watching the scene remotely via a fibreoptic link decides whether or not to issue a warning through a loudspeaker or press the fire button</s>
<s>the robot sentry the samson remote weapon station could function without human intervention says david ishai of rafael its israeli manufacturer based in haifa</s>
<s>but he says switching to automatic mode would be a bad idea—and illegal to boot</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>traditional rules of engagement stipulate that a human must decide if a weapon is to be fired</s>
<s>but this restriction is starting to come under pressure</s>
<s>already defence planners are considering whether a drone aircraft should be able to fire a weapon based on its own analysis</s>
<s>in 2009 the authors of a us air force report suggested that humans will increasingly operate not “in the loop” but “on the loop” monitoring armed robots rather than fully controlling them</s>
<s>better artificial intelligence will eventually allow robots to “make lethal combat decisions” they wrote provided legal and ethical issues can be resolved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a report on the matter issued by britains ministry of defence last year argued that if a drones control system takes appropriate account of the law on armed conflicts basically military necessity humanity proportionality and the ability to distinguish between military targets and civilians then an autonomous strike could meet legal norms</s>
<s>testing and certifying such a system would be difficult</s>
<s>but the authors concluded that “as technology matures…policymakers will need to be aware of the potential legal issues and take advice at a very early stage of any new systems procurement cycle”</s>

<s>pressure will grow for armies to automate their robots if only so machines can shoot before being shot says jürgen altmann of the technical university of dortmund in germany and a founder of the international committee for robot arms control an advocacy group</s>
<s>some robot weapons already operate without human operators to save precious seconds</s>
<s>an incoming antiship missile detected even a dozen miles away can be safely shot down only by a robot says frank biemans head of sensing technologies for the goalkeeper automatic shipdefence cannons made by thales nederland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>admittedly that involves a machine destroying another machine</s>
<s>but as human operators struggle to assimilate the information collected by robotic sensors decisionmaking by robots seems likely to increase</s>
<s>this might be a good thing says ronald arkin a roboticist at the georgia institute of technology who is developing “ethics software” for armed robots</s>
<s>by crunching data from drone sensors and military databases it might be possible to predict for example that a strike from a missile could damage a nearby religious building</s>
<s>clever software might be used to call off attacks as well as initiate them</s>

<s>in the air on land and at sea military robots are proliferating</s>
<s>but the revolution in military robotics does have an achilles heel notes emmanuel goffi of the french airforce academy in salondeprovence</s>
<s>as robots become more autonomous identifying a human to hold accountable for a bloody blunder will become very difficult he says</s>
<s>should it be the robots programmer designer manufacturer human overseer or his superiors</s>
<s>it is hard to say</s>
<s>the backlash from a deadly and wellpublicised mistake may be the only thing that can halt the rapid march of the robots</s>
