<s>pity karolos papoulias the 82yearold president who has been trying to persuade greeces fractious political leaders to form a nationalunity government after the election on may 6th failed to produce a clear winner</s>
<s>mr papoulias a softspoken former foreign minister struggled for nine days handing out and receiving several mandates and even making a threeday effort of his own before giving up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>success would have given greece a breathingspace if only a short one to pursue urgent reforms such as recapitalising its banks and getting on with privatisation</s>
<s>that might have helped it to rebuild its shattered credibility with both its european union partners and financial markets</s>
<s>instead another election will be held on june 17th</s>
<s>a caretaker government under panagiotis pikrammenos greeces most senior judge will run the country in the interim</s>
<s>lucas papademos a former european central banker who led a coalition government for six months overseeing a €206 billion sovereigndebt restructuring was not asked to stay on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the transcripts of mr papouliass final three meetings made public at the request of alexis tsipras a rising political star and leader of syriza a hardleft coalition reveal a disturbing lack of vision</s>
<s>rather than tackle such serious questions as how to keep greece in the euro prickly political leaders shrugged off warnings that a run on greek banks was imminent and swapped insults instead</s>
<s>reading the texts makes voters still more frustrated</s>
<s>“theyre all irresponsible none of them is capable of ending this crisis” said aristomenes antonopoulos a lawyer</s>
<s>“how to vote now”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>support among greeks for staying in the euro is stronger than ever up from 70 to 80 in the past three months say opinion polls</s>
<s>yet fears that prolonged political instability could trigger a greek exit are also increasing</s>
<s>greek savers withdrew as much as €2 billion from local banks almost 2 of total deposits as hopes of forming a coalition were collapsing</s>
<s>and this figure does not include a surge of investment in “safe haven” german and british government bonds since the election</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>greece has seen a steady erosion of bank deposits over the past two years yet few bankers were prepared for such a rapid acceleration of withdrawals</s>
<s>deposits actually increased in march and april thanks to the smooth handling of greeces partial default</s>
<s>by the middle of the week cash was still being taken away but in orderly fashion</s>
<s>there were no queues outside bank branches in central athens or its suburbs</s>
<s>customers ordered cash by telephone and picked it up 24 hours later</s>
<s>some went straight into safe deposit boxes at the same bank some was stashed under mattresses in case greece readopts the drachma</s>
<s>“people are taking preventive measures…if you own a pile of euros youll feel rich in a drachma environment” said one veteran greek banker</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for all their enthusiasm to keep the euro greeks are also fed up with the austerity that german leaders are imposing as the price of continued membership</s>
<s>syriza feeds on this inconsistency arguing that greece can stay in the euro but reject the terms of its euimf bailout</s>
<s>according to an opinion poll on may 13th syriza would win 205 of the vote and come first in the june 17th election just ahead of the proeuro new democracy 194</s>
<s>even though that would give syriza the winners bonus of 50 extra seats it would still fall well short of an overall majority</s>
<s>the panhellenic socialist movement pasok which also supports the bailout would come a distant third with 118</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr tsipras is reorganising his party and renewing his campaign neighbourhood by neighbourhood concentrating on athens and other cities where syriza came first on may 6th</s>
<s>his rhetoric is sharper than ever yet his dream of forming a leftwing coalition government is no nearer reality than at the previous election</s>
<s>potential leftwing partners have been uncooperative ever since mr tsipras bounced into second place behind new democracy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>antonis samaras new democracys leader will pull out all the stops</s>
<s>if he cannot form a government this time his career may be over</s>
<s>a new alliance with a small liberal party led by dora bakoyannis whom he defeated for the party leadership in 2009 may give him an extra couple of points</s>
<s>but evangelos venizelos the pasok leader and a potential coalition partner will struggle to stop more voters leaving for syriza</s>
<s>even if new democracy again came first and took those extra 50 seats the two big parties would still struggle to form a government</s>
<s>the longsuffering president papoulias is likely to be back in action again on june 18th</s>
