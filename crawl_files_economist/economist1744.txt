<s>banks in china appear to be in rude health</s>
<s>the seven biggest mainland banks have just posted a 16 yearonyear increase in pretax profits between them for the first quarter</s>
<s>the level of nonperforming loans npls remains low at just about 1</s>
<s>but trouble is being stored up for the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are two big worries bad localgovernment debt and souring property loans</s>
<s>the infrastructure binge of the past few years saw a boom in localgovernment financing vehicles lgfvs offbalancesheet entities used to get around prohibitions on borrowing</s>
<s>regulators say these entities bank debts were worth $14 trillion at the end of september</s>
<s>private estimates range much higher and suggest that 2030 may be nonperforming</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the government is trying to defuse the bomb</s>
<s>one experiment is the issuance of local bonds to replace these loans</s>
<s>officials also published guidance in march pushing banks to roll loans over in the hope that growth will solve the problem</s>
<s>another wheeze is shoving these loans onto the books of “policy banks” like china development bank cdb whose balancesheets are now suffering see chart</s>
<s>half a trillion yuan around $80 billion in lgfv debt was rolled over last year from commercial banks to the cdb alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other headache is property which is undergoing a governmentforced cooling</s>
<s>because real estate touches many parts of the economy some worry that npls in this sector may be harder to isolate than localgovernment debt</s>
<s>michael werner of sanford c bernstein an investment bank is relaxed pointing to official figures claiming that 75 of property loans are collateralised compared with only 38 of loans to manufacturers and 24 of those to utilities</s>
<s>fine but that reassures only if the collateral is good</s>
<s>it may not be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>charlene chu of fitch a ratings agency thinks official statistics have to be treated with care in any case</s>
<s>several factors are masking the true level of npls she reckons</s>
<s>one is the practice of rolling over bad debt another is the ability of distressed borrowers to turn to a vibrant shadowbanking sector for loans when in trouble</s>
<s>banks are also shifting lots of activities off their balancesheets</s>
<s>by moving deposits from normal accounts to “wealthmanagement accounts” for example banks can reduce the ostensible deposit base against which they must hold reserves but must also pay much higher interest rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the chinese banking system is already among the most thinly capitalised in emerging markets the ratio of equity to assets is 6</s>
<s>ms chu calculates that if a tenth of the banking systems outstanding credit turns sour over the next two years all profits and 39 of the systems equity will be wiped out</s>
<s>if npls are unreliable indicators liquidity measures may be a better signal of brewing trouble</s>
<s>pointing to a rise in marketbased interest rates and slowing loan growth she argues that a crunch has already started</s>
<s>the banks figures do not immediately show it but the hangover from chinas postcrisis credit boom may be under way</s>
