<s>angry steelworkers must have winced as they marched past the slogan in their thousands in early january demanding higher wages</s>
<s>their threeday strike was unusually large for an enterprise owned by the central government</s>
<s>but as chinas economy begins to grow more sedately more such unrest is looming</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chinas statecontrolled media kept quiet about the protest that began on january 4th in qingbaijiang district a 40minute drive northeast of chengdu on an expressway that crosses a patchwork of vegetable fields and bamboo thickets</s>
<s>but news of the strike quickly broke on the internet</s>
<s>photographs circulated on microblogs of a large crowd of workers from pangang group chengdu steel and vanadium being kept away from a slip road to the expressway by a phalanx of police</s>
<s>word spread that police had tried to disperse the workers with tear gas</s>
<s>in the end as they tend to—and undoubtedly acting on government orders—factory officials backed down partially at least</s>
<s>the workers got a raise albeit a smaller one than they wanted</s>
<s>managers wages were frozen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>strikes have become increasingly frequent at privately owned factories in recent years often involving workers demanding higher wages or better conditions</s>
<s>private firms like state ones are usually strongarmed by officials into buying off strikers</s>
<s>the thinking is that capitulating keeps a lid on news coverage and helps to prevent unrest from spreading</s>
<s>yet the explosive growth in the use of homegrown versions of twitter has made it easy for protesters to convey instant reports and images to huge audiences</s>
<s>the communist partys capacity to stop ripples of unease from widening is waning—just as economic conditions are making trouble more likely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anger at the bottom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at a cheap restaurant in qingbaijiang opposite a dormitory compound for pangang employees grimy steelworkers complain that the governments promise of an extra 260 yuan $41 a month is hardly enough</s>
<s>many of the lowestpaid earn as little as $190 monthly</s>
<s>but the workers know that the steel industry is struggling—and that vengeance on persistent troublemakers can be fierce</s>
<s>a police notice warns of legal action including imprisonment against any strikers who continue “disrupting public order”</s>
<s>security agents follow your correspondent in an unmarked car</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this is partly a result of the curb on chinas stimulus spending and carefree reckless many would say bank lending in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008</s>
<s>there are fewer new construction projects demand for steel has flattened</s>
<s>pangangs plant in qingbaijiang is running at a loss</s>
<s>the number of steel firms in the red rose from nine in september to 25 a month later</s>
<s>even though the government is less worried about inflation now than it was a few months ago and is releasing the economic brakes a little the steel industry is expecting a lean period</s>
<s>some firms might have to close</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>overall economic growth is still looking robust</s>
<s>in the final three months of 2011 chinas economy grew by 89 compared with the same period a year earlier—enviable by almost anyone elses standards though still the slowest since the second quarter of 2009</s>
<s>the slowdown has so far been gentle and in line with government efforts to prevent overheating</s>
<s>but this does not stop officials worrying that the coming year could be unusually difficult</s>

<p>
<s>europe is the biggest buyer of chinese products—and the euro zones travails have plunged many manufacturers into despair</s>
<s>depressed demand in both europe and america has taken its toll on factories</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>chinese exporters do not face as big a shock now as they did in late 2008 when the financial crisis caused a sudden collapse in demand and the loss of as many as 20m migrantlabour jobs</s>
<s>but that time chinas recovery was rapid helped by stimulus spending of 4 trillion yuan more than $630 billion at todays exchange rate as well as developed economies own stimulus projects</s>
<s>the impact on migrant workers was further mitigated by the coincidence of the worst of the downturn with the lunar newyear holiday when most migrants go home for lengthy periods</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this time exporters face protracted slow growth in developed economies and the risk that the euro zones difficulties might worsen</s>
<s>chinas policymakers do not want another lending spree that might burden the financial system with more bad debt on top of the borrowing accumulated during the previous binge</s>
<s>the countrys relatively low budget deficit about 25 of gdp in 2010 gives it room to spend more on social housing social security tax cuts for small firms and consumer subsidies</s>
<s>these could help promote private consumption—eventually</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nerves at the top</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the longterm plan is for china to wean itself off its reliance on exports and investment projects such as roads railways and overpriced property developments and for domestic consumption of goods and services to play a much bigger role in fuelling growth</s>
<s>but this rebalancing will be a long hard slog</s>
<s>officials do not want shock therapy because it could threaten the jobs of many of the 160m migrants who come from the countryside to provide the cheap labour behind chinas exports</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this economic quandary has become more acute at what is a delicate political moment for the communist party</s>
<s>later this year probably in october or november the party will hold its fiveyearly congress the 18th since its founding in 1921 at which sweeping changes in the countrys top leadership will begin to unfold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the congress will “elect” a new 300member central committee in fact it will be handpicked by senior leaders</s>

<s>two appointments are all but certain vicepresident xi jinping to take over from president hu jintao as party chief after the congress and as president next march and li keqiang to replace his boss the prime minister wen jiabao also next march</s>
<s>there will be much jockeying for the other slots</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is a decade since china experienced a leadership changeover on this scale—and the first time since the late 1980s that the advent of a new generation of leaders has coincided with such a troubled patch for the economy</s>
<s>the previous time in 1988 an outbreak of inflation threw deng xiaopings succession plans into disarray giving conservatives ammunition with which to attack his liberal protégés</s>
<s>the partys strife erupted into the open the following year as students demanding greater freedom gathered in tiananmen square</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the threats to the party today are very different but fear of largescale unrest still haunts the leadership</s>
<s>the past decade has seen the emergence of a big middle class—nearly 40 of the urban population as some chinese scholars define it—and a huge migration from the countryside into the cities</s>
<s>the party takes no chances</s>
<s>large numbers of plainclothes police are on permanent watch in and around tiananmen square</s>
<s>since 2008 visitors to the vast plaza have had to undergo airporttype scanning and searches</s>
<s> early last year when anonymous calls began circulating on the internet for citizens to gather in central beijing in sympathy with the uprisings that were breaking out in the arab world the location specified was not tiananmen but wangfujing a shopping street nearby</s>

<s>they are afraid that this time after the lunar new year break they will have no jobs to come back to</s>
<s>a plainclothes policeman tries to silence them</s>
<s>then a uniformed officer moves in with a video camera and most of the workers retreat keeping a prudent silence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>others in the delta have been less reticent</s>
<s>in november thousands of employees at a taiwanese shoe factory in dongguan took to the streets in protest against salary cuts and sackings purportedly caused by declining orders</s>
<s>protesters overturned cars and clashed with police</s>
<s>photographs of bloodied workers circulated on the internet</s>
<s>there have been further protests in recent weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>guangdong province also saw a wave of strikes in 2010</s>
<s>at that time workers—mainly in factories supplying the car industry—were demanding only higher pay and improved conditions</s>
<s>most of those disputes were quickly and peacefully settled and rarely involved action on the streets</s>
<s>the latest spate of confrontations looks different</s>
<s>the steelworkers at the stateowned factory near chengdu wanted a raise but these days rather than bidding to improve their lots workers are mostly complaining about wages and jobs being cut</s>
<s>the strikers seem more militant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a report published this month by the chinese academy of social sciences cass says that compared with those in 2010 the strikes of 2011 were better organised more confrontational and more likely to trigger copycat action</s>

<s>he has been trying to turn chongqing into a model for the absorption of rural labour into cities a project that has involved vast spending on lowcost housing to accommodate the regions migrants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but rising numbers of migrant workers in big cities—more than 60 according to the national bureau of statistics in 2010—are themselves the offspring of migrants and have no experience of agricultural life</s>
<s>they regard themselves as urbanites even if they are excluded from many of the welfare benefits to which citydwellers are entitled</s>
<s>they are better educated than their parents generation and more assertive</s>
<s>a riot by migrants last june in dadun another factory town in guangdong where many of the countrys jeans are produced hinted at the problems china could face if secondgeneration migrants lose hope</s>

<p>
<s>such unrest is not about to topple the party</s>
<s>as chinese officials nervously digest the implications of unrest in the arab world demonstrations in russia and an easing of repression in myanmar they draw comfort from the consistency of chinese opinion polls</s>

<s>confidence in the government has fallen by about 10 percentage points to around 60</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr yuan says the rapid spread of microblogs has contributed to this decline</s>

<s>this was slightly more than the number who used email and a rise of nearly fourfold over the year before according to the governmentaffiliated china internet network information centre</s>
<s>li chunling of cass estimates that 90 of urban internet users under 30 are microbloggers</s>

<p>
<s>weibo have transformed public discourse in china</s>
<s>news that three or four years ago would have been relatively easy for local officials to suppress downplay or ignore is now instantly transmitted across the nation</s>
<s>local protests or scandals to which few would once have paid attention are now avidly discussed by weibo users</s>
<s>the government tries hard but largely ineffectively to control this debate by blocking key words and cancelling the accounts of muckraking users</s>
<s>circumventions are easily found</s>
<s>since december the government has been rolling out a new rule that people must use their real names to open accounts</s>
<s>so far users seem undeterred</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the buildup to the 18th congress chinas leaders will become especially anxious to prevent embarrassment to the party</s>
<s>weibo are likely to make their lives a lot more difficult—at least that was the lesson from a tenday standoff in december between police and residents of the coastal village of wukan in guangdong</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the villagers protest was typical of thousands that roil the chinese countryside every year a complaint about the seizure of agricultural land by local officials for private redevelopment</s>
<s>unusually however in wukan citizens took control of their village and drove out party hacks and police</s>
<s>officials were alarmed by images that circulated on weibo of triumphant residents rallying in the centre of their village like students in tiananmen square 22 years ago see the picture at the start of this piece</s>
<s>they tried unsuccessfully to stop news spreading by ordering a block on the villages name and location</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the villagers gave up their protest on december 21st after a rare highprofile intervention by the guangdong party leadership which promised to look into their complaints</s>
<s>remarkably on january 15th the protest leader lin zuluan was appointed as the villages new party chief the previous one having disappeared it is thought into custody</s>
<s>even the partys main mouthpiece in beijing broke its silence on the issue saying it showed that local officials should stop treating citizens as adversaries</s>
<s>wang yang guangdongs party chief who is believed to be a contender for a senior politburo position this year said the incident demonstrated how peoples “democratic consciousness” was getting stronger</s>
<s>he called on officials not to ignore citizens concerns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>few regard the wukan episode as a turning point for the party</s>
<s>at least one protester on tiananmen square has since been seen being dragged away by police in the usual fashion</s>
<s>but it has stirred debate online at least about how the party should respond to protests and other forms of public pressure</s>
<s>and villagers in wukan warn that they will not be satisfied until they have reclaimed their land</s>
<s>one protest leader says there could be another “even bigger” uprising</s>

<s>mr zhang himself the son of a late senior official as are several of the new leaderstobe said a new democracy would involve continued party rule but with much greater freedom</s>

<p>
<s>few of chinas liberals believe there is much chance of any leader pursuing this idea in the near future</s>
