<s>in 2011 companies will begin to say goodbye to the written word</s>
<s>the basic unit of communication will no longer be typed out in emails</s>
<s>it will be shot in pictures and shown on video</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>companies have already discovered that the written word is failing them</s>
<s>its feebleness compared with the moving image was rammed home in 2010 when the sight of bps oil spewing out into the gulf of mexico on youtube sent a message to the world far more compelling than any written statement could ever be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the word has become weak at conveying big corporate messages it has become even weaker at conveying small ones</s>
<s>for years the inboxes of all office workers have been overflowing with unread emails</s>
<s>but in 2011 managers will do something about it and desist from communicating with staff in this way</s>
<s>email will still exist as a way of talking to one person at a time but as a means of mass communication it will be finished</s>
<s>companies will find instead that to get a message over to employees customers shareholders and the outside world video is far more effective</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the past three years video has come from nothing to make up nearly half of internet traffic by 2012 it is likely to be more than threequarters</s>
<s>so far corporations have taken a back seat in this growth but in 2011 they will climb into the front and start to drive it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this shift in communications will have three important effects</s>
<s>it will change the sort of person who makes it to the corner office</s>
<s>it will alter the way that businesses are managed</s>
<s>and it will shift the position corporations occupy in society and possibly make us like some of them just a little bit more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new corporate leaders will no longer be pen pushers and bean counters</s>
<s>the 20year reign of faceless bosses will come to an end</s>
<s>charisma will be back in all successful business chiefs will have to be storytellers and performers</s>
<s>just as political leaders have long had to be dynamite on tv to stand much hope of election or survival so too will corporate leaders</s>
<s>they must be able to sell not only their vision of their companies but their vision of themselves</s>
<s>the new big boss will be expected to set an example any leaders showing signs of human frailty will be out on their ears</s>
<s>the moral majority will tighten its hold on corporate life first in america but then elsewhere too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with this shift will come a change in management style</s>
<s>numbers and facts will be supplanted by appeals to emotion to make employees and customers do what they are told</s>
<s>the businesspersons emotion may be no more genuine than the politicians but successful bosses will get good at faking it</s>
<s>others will struggle prepare to cringe in 2011 as corporate leaders spout a lot of phoney stuff that used to look bad enough when written down but will sound even worse spoken</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one good consequence of the change however will be a greater clarity in the way companies think about their businesses</s>
<s>the written word was a forgiving medium for overcomplicated illconceived messages</s>
<s>video demands simplicity and immediacy</s>
<s>the best companies will use this to their advantage by thinking through more rigorously what it is they are trying to say and do</s>

<s>in 2011 grandiose strategy will be out of fashion</s>
<s>companies strapped for cash and chastened by recession will focus more on execution</s>
<s>management consultants already having had a bad time of it in 2010 will have an even tougher job selling their overpriced strategic services</s>
<s>unless they can offer clear practical help they will find themselves out of work</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>within companies it will be a dull time behind the scenes in 2011</s>
<s>the two most overused phrases will be “core business” and “risk management” as people shun the fancy in favour of the familiar</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in this new world—all show and emotion on the surface and all meanness and efficiency underneath—women will not thrive</s>
<s>the new corporate leader will resemble the old one in one way at least he will be a man</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however there may be some good that will come from it</s>
<s>successful companies will start to tell a new story about their role in the world</s>
<s>as the public sector shrinks and budgets are cut a gap will open up</s>
<s>smart businesses will grab the chance to play the role of white knight</s>
<s>they will find that “giving something back” can be upgraded from afterthought to a central part of the business</s>
<s>in 2010 the world learned how to hate big business</s>
<s>in 2011 some businesses will shed the villains cloak and become heroes</s>
