<s>with his poll numbers at nearrecord lows president nicolas sarkozy does not have much to be thankful for these days</s>
<s>but in a crucial week for the euro zone he can draw some comfort from the surprising way that the french have reacted to the sovereigndebt crisis</s>
<s>unlike the germans who seize every opportunity to denounce chancellor angela merkel for using their hardearned money to rescue feckless southern europeans the french do not seem to mind a bit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>france has contributed around €11 billion $16 billion so far to the greek bailout roughly the same as germany</s>
<s>in the euro zones other creditor countries such as finland and the netherlands the cost of the rescues has been the source of fierce argument</s>
<s>yet in france there has been almost no public debate over whether to help greece or other troubled peripheral countries</s>
<s>no mainstream political party contests the view that everything must be done to save the single currency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the french blame the euro for rising prices but 67 of them say they still want to keep the single currency</s>
<s>even more startling fully 59 think france should help greece financially according to a recent ifop poll next to only 41 of germans</s>
<s>this week two socialist presidential hopefuls martine aubry and françois hollande mustered a modicum of disagreement—but only over how not whether to rescue the euro</s>
<s>“greece must be saved in order to save europe” ms aubry averred in an article in libération a newspaper</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why has there been no bailout backlash</s>
<s>frances postwar faith in the european project offers only half an explanation since germany has shared that creed</s>
<s>french voters also rejected the draft european union constitution in a referendum six years ago</s>
<s>a more fanciful theory is that mr sarkozy has a natural sympathy for the country that was home to his maternal grandfather a jew from thessaloniki</s>
<s>another is that the french consider that france and greece are two great civilisations that ought to stand by each other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more seriously frances banks have a greater exposure to peripheral bonds than any other countrys see chart so they back efforts to have that debt honoured</s>
<s>mr sarkozy has resisted mrs merkels view that some pain should be imposed on privatesector bondholders preferring a voluntary rollover scheme</s>
<s>in addition with italy now under close scrutiny by the bond markets the french are keenly aware that with a budget deficit in 2011 forecast to be closer to greeces than to germanys they might be the speculators next target</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a deeper reason could be that the french often fail to see the connection between the governments money and their taxes</s>
<s>laurence parisot head of medef the employers federation suggests that because the french believe in a strong state they are more trusting of its ability to spend their taxes wisely</s>
<s>voters rarely talk about a burden on “the taxpayer” even their word for it le contribuable sounds less painful on the purse</s>
<s>the french are also less alert to the need to protect competitiveness gains than the germans postreunification have been</s>
<s>“in germany competitiveness issues are part of the social compact” says a senior french official</s>
<s>“in france economic issues do not form part of the cohesion of the country”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>amid this consensus behind solidarité for the euro however there is one glaring exception marine le pen</s>
<s>the leader of the national front who wants france to quit the single currency before it implodes claims that “debate about the euro in france is taboo we have no right to query it and so the french dont know how much we have spent” ms le pen is beginning to make antieuro tirades as much her hallmark as those against excessive immigration</s>
<s>her unorthodox views are a real threat to mainstream parties polls still suggest that at next years presidential election she could make it into the runoff</s>
