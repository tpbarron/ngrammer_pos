<s>on his visit to america this week chinas vicepresident xi jinping serenely played the role his aides had scripted for him as the countrys leaderinwaiting charming his hosts but revealing little see lexington</s>
<s>at home however the communist partys plans for a sweeping shuffle of its hierarchy later this year were beginning to appear less orderly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there remains little doubt that mr xi will take over from hu jintao as party chief at a fiveyearly congress to be held sometime in the autumn</s>
<s>but the prospects of another aspirant to top office bo xilai pictured above have been overshadowed</s>
<s>on february 6th his onetime righthand man wang lijun fled to the american consulate in the city of chengdu</s>
<s>mr wang stayed inside for a day before walking out into the hands of chinese security officials who are believed to have taken him to beijing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>little is known about what prompted mr wang to make the 340km 210 mile drive to chengdu from chongqing a provincesized municipality where mr bo known as an urbane populist is party chief and the dour mr wang is a deputy mayor</s>
<s>most analysts believe that mr wangs removal from his other post as police chief five days earlier signalled a fallingout between the two men</s>
<s>one popular explanation for this is that mr bo wanted to distance himself from mr wang who—rumour has it—was being investigated for corruption</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far mr bo has appeared unruffled</s>
<s>he attended a scheduled meeting on february 11th with canadas visiting prime minister stephen harper as well as gatherings of senior officials</s>
<s>but if as is possible mr wang tries to defend his actions by claiming persecution and by levelling accusations against mr bo or if mr wang turns out not to be the superhero policeman of his public image the case would have big political ramifications</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr bo is a former minister of commerce and considered to be one of chinas more charismatic senior leaders</s>
<s>before last week he was thought likely to be promoted to the politburos ninemember standing committee in the autumn</s>
<s>his failure to gain a seat would be a blow to two influential political camps</s>
<s>one is a group made up of the “old left” who lament the passing of maoism and the “new left” who want to restore some of maos more workerfriendly policies</s>
<s>this group extols chongqing as a model of the way the country should be run</s>
<s>it admires mr bo for his heavy spending on social housing and on education and health care for migrants</s>
<s>the old left likes mr bos attempts to revive “red culture” including the singing of old revolutionary songs and his fierce campaign carried out by mr wang against corruption and organised crime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other more disparate camp is that of “secondgeneration reds” as the offspring of old revolutionaries are often called</s>
<s>mr bo is one of the most prominent and charismatic of these “princelings” as they are more disparagingly known</s>
<s>mr xi also belongs to this group though it is unlikely that mr bos troubles would affect him</s>
<s> kenneth lieberthal of the brookings institution an american thinktank says it is possible that leaders at the top are trying to rein in mr bo because they do not like his very public grandstanding</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>liberals in china are crowing over mr bos plight because of what they see as his trampling on legal procedures during his antimafia campaign as well as the chilling reminders his “red songs” convey of maos totalitarianism</s>
<s>but party leaders in beijing will have to tread carefully</s>
<s>they do not want wider questioning of the princelings right to rule</s>
<s>and they do not want to precipitate unrest</s>
<s>mr bo is popular in chongqing and more broadly elsewhere among the urban poor</s>
<s>the old left command loyal if scattered followings among workers laid off from stateowned enterprises in many cities</s>
<s>maoist websites in china have been fuming about what they describe as attacks by unnamed “treacherous officials” on mr bo and mr wang</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chinese leaders have another good reason to keep the lid on their differences</s>
<s>the last succession process a decade ago was the first orderly one in the history of communist party rule in china</s>
<s>the party is eager to convince the world that power transfers have become a smooth tenyearly routine</s>
<s>it has dismissed mr wangs bizarre dash to the consulate as an “isolated” incident</s>
<s>officials are doubtless relieved that their american counterparts are keeping quiet about what they learned during mr wangs visit</s>
