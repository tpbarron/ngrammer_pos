<s>such is the reverence for mario monti that some compare him to lucius quinctius cincinnatus the patrician recalled from retirement to save ancient rome</s>
<s>legend recounts how cincinnatus was working in his fields in 458bc when he was approached by messengers told to don his toga and informed that he had been appointed dictator for six months to confront the aequi who had trapped a roman army</s>
<s>having defeated the foes cincinnatus surrendered his absolute powers and returned to the plough refusing all spoils and gifts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so when italy faced disaster last year with bond markets about to push it into insolvency mr monti was summoned from his tranquil existence as president of milans bocconi university and sage on matters european</s>
<s>appointed senator for life he took power from the dissolute silvio berlusconi on november 16th</s>
<s>he appointed a small cabinet of technocrats and naming himself finance minister refused a salary for his cabinet jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in three months he has pulled italy back from catastrophe</s>
<s>spending cuts tax rises and pension reforms—plus a highprofile campaign against tax evasion—have put the public finances back on track to balance the budget next year and with luck to start paying down the colossal debt thereafter</s>
<s>to help revive growth mr monti wants to liberalise closed professions such as pharmacists and notaries and to simplify bureaucracy</s>
<s>the next step is harder reform of italys sclerotic twotier labour market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the threat of bankruptcy has receded as yields on italian bonds have dropped</s>
<s>this has much to do with another italian the president of the european central bank mario draghi who has hosed europes banks with liquidity</s>
<s>but mr draghi was able to act in part because mr monti had restored italys credibility</s>
<s>tellingly italian yields have just dipped back below those of spain which wants to breach its eumandated deficit target this year see article</s>
<s>barely 100 days in office mr monti has overseen many reforms that mr berlusconi shrank from</s>
<s>and the professor has kept his support from parties of left and right</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if mr montis economic competence was to be expected his diplomatic agility has been a pleasant surprise</s>
<s>italy a founder member of the european union has returned to the centre of policymaking after the marginalisation and mockery of the berlusconi years</s>
<s>having signed the fiscal compact on budgetary discipline mr monti wants the eu to adopt an “economic compact” to promote growth especially by releasing the potential of the single market</s>
<s>as one diplomat puts it mr monti seeks “more europe in italy and more italy in europe”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr monti is a darling of eurocrats having served two terms as a big beast of the european commission</s>
<s>but he is courted beyond brussels</s>
<s>he has been invited for talks with barack obama</s>
<s>chancellor angela merkel will visit rome on march 13th</s>
<s>suddenly eu politics has become fluid</s>
<s>for germany mr monti vindicates the idea that fixing the euro mainly needs reform in troubled countries</s>
<s>for france he is an ally in his demands that germany do more eg enlarge the rescue fund</s>
<s>for britain he offers help to rejoin the fold after its isolation at the eu summit in december</s>
<s>for smaller countries he offers freedom to manoeuvre between the big four</s>
<s>“it is good to have italy back” says another diplomat</s>
<s>“europe is now a chair with four legs”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tellingly mr monti has signed up to a letter sponsored by britain the netherlands and other liberal countries urging stronger enforcement of singlemarket rules including the naming and shaming of countries that fail to abide by commitments to open up energy and services</s>
<s>italians may be less enthusiastic about some of the letters other demands notably for freer trade italy has often been a loser in globalisation</s>
<s>but mr montis belief in the single market is beyond doubt it is a strong source of new growth it builds ties between troubled southern and dynamic northern economies and it preserves unity between eurozone “ins” and “outs”</s>
<s>it also discomfits mrs merkel</s>
<s>germany may resist demands to stump up more bailout funds</s>
<s>but is it too much to ask it to open up its markets as it demands of others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new prominence of italy is not all the result of mr montis innate skills</s>
<s>the eu was bound to rejoice in anybody but mr berlusconi and leaders are keen to strengthen mr montis hand</s>
<s>much could still go wrong</s>
<s>mr monti has yet to show he can cure italys most serious affliction its chronic slow growth</s>
<s>the economy is forecast to contract by more this year than the latest budget allows for</s>
<s>resistance to austerity and reforms may grow especially if a deep recession undermines mr montis fragile crossparty support</s>
<s>his balancing act is delicate britain may find his integrationism hard to bear france may resent his liberalising instinct and even mr montis authority may not divert germany from its selfdefeating obsession with austerity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>remember to step down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>above all mr monti is short of time</s>
<s>fixing italy could take a decade but his mandate ends next year</s>
<s>he would not be the first italian technocrat to see his work undone by feckless politicians</s>
<s>yet longterm reforms need a clear democratic mandate</s>
<s>some in mr berlusconis people of freedom party think they should enlist mr monti to lead them in the 2013 election</s>
<s>that would be a mistake his prestige relies on nonpartisanship</s>
<s>having seen off the crisis mr monti should retire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is not to say that the professor has no political future</s>
<s>he would be a good candidate in 2014 for president of the european commission or the european council representing leaders</s>
<s>and just as cincinnatus was recalled a second time to prevent a plot to overthrow the roman republic mr monti may yet be summoned to serve as italys president—if only to dispel any risk of mr berlusconi getting the job</s>
