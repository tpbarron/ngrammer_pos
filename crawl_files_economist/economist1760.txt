<s>among the first visitors to the elysée palace after françois hollandes victory in the french presidential election last month were tradeunion leaders from arcelormittals steel factory at florange in lorraine</s>
<s>the region is the crucible of frances traditional heavy industry people have been making iron in lorraine for more than 300 years</s>
<s>but the blastfurnace fires started to go out last year when recession slashed demand for steel and forced arcelormittal the worlds biggest steelmaker by some distance to start closing its least efficient plants</s>
<s>by october both floranges furnaces had been snuffed out supposedly for a year</s>
<s>last month the company said they would stay cool for another six months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the unions fear that they will never be fired up again and that steelmaking on a symbolic site will come to an end</s>
<s>after the union leaders visit mr hollande asked arnaud de montebourg the minister for productivity to get an expert to review the prospects for florange and to request the governments of belgium germany luxembourg and spain to “act together visàvis arcelormittal”—whatever that means</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>union fears are probably well founded arcelormittal has labelled florange and its plants at liège in belgium “noncore”</s>
<s>the company has already started the cumbersome twoyear process needed under belgian labour law to close liège permanently</s>
<s>although it describes the florange shutdown as temporary it plainly wants to close that plant for good too although it is loth to say so in public</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with overcapacity in europe and consolidation worldwide only modern coastal steelworks can compete</s>
<s>older inland sites originally built atop ironore mines are now seeing the world pass them by</s>
<s>pressure to close less efficient plants has increased since arcelor and corus both european firms were merged into the global mittal and tata empires in the past five years and since recession put an end to a steel boom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the florange site has more than just blast furnaces they employ only about 500 workers out of a total of 2700</s>
<s>the rest are in rolling mills that prepare finished steel for the car and construction industries or in research and development</s>
<s>with the blast furnaces shut steel slabs are shipped inland from the companys coastal furnaces at dunkirk</s>
<s>but that in turn is less efficient than doing everything at integrated coastal sites such as dunkirk which import ore at one end and roll out finished steel at the other</s>
<s>so the fear is that in the long term even the rolling mills at florange are doomed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since the first blast furnace closed last summer the workers have been mounting periodic protests in florange and occasionally in paris</s>
<s>the accession of mr hollandes socialist government has brought them powerful friends or at least demonstrative ones aurélie filippetti the minister of culture turned up outside the mill to toast the protesters with champagne</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile arcelormittal says it has had no contact with the elysée palace</s>
<s>the company which has its headquarters in london and luxembourg employs 300000 people—20000 in france where it is a leading foreign investor</s>
<s>its foreign ownership may be one reason why it is under fire from the new government but french firms could also be shot at once this months parliamentary elections are out of the way</s>
<s>psa peugeotcitröen air franceklm and carrefour are on a long list of firms said by unions to be preparing to announce mass redundancies</s>
