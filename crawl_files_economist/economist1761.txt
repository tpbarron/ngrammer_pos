<s>the proposed merger of nippon steel japans largest steelmaker with sumitomo metals a domestic rival was announced on february 3rd</s>
<s>the new steel firm would be the worlds second largest after arcelormittal of luxembourg</s>
<s>it is a welcome sign that japan inc is adapting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steel provided the backbone of japans postwar industrial rise</s>
<s>its quality—japanese carmakers swear by it—still makes it a symbol of the countrys manufacturing prowess</s>
<s>a move to tie up japans number one and number three steelmakers is a sign that the nations bosses are at last responding to the urgent need for corporate restructuring</s>
<s>it is the countrys first steelindustry merger since 2002 and comes as rising rawmaterial prices and steely competition from other east asian producers have exposed alarming overcapacity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the merger which both companies hope to sign in april 2012 is to a degree a family affair</s>
<s>nippon steel and sumitomo metals have roots in rival osaka industrial groups but now cooperate and have small crossshareholdings so they know each other well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>together they have a capacity of 478m tonnes</s>
<s>that is well short of arcelormittal which produced 732m tonnes in 2009</s>
<s>but perhaps putting together two producers of highquality steel will be better than focusing on quantity alone</s>
<s>and if their example is followed elsewhere in japans sclerotic corporate landscape so much the better for the economy</s>
