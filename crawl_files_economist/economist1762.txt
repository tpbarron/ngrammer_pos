<s>when mario monti became italys prime minister german pharmacists fretted</s>
<s>not for what he would do in italy but because as europes competition tsar he tried to liberalise professional services such as law medicine and pharmacy</s>
<s>mr monti is now prising open italys closed professions—and thinks europes biggest economy should do the same</s>
<s>there is “still lots of room for a liberalisation of services” in germany he said recently</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>germany is not often told to reform</s>
<s>its big manufacturers trade surpluses and robust jobs market make it the envy of europe</s>
<s>frances nicolas sarkozy promises to make his country more like germany</s>
<s>it is resented for its strength but rarely chided for weakness</s>
<s>yet germanys manufacturing juggernaut sits alongside puny services</s>
<s>in 200007 value added in market services grew by 22 a year compared with an average of 31 in the oecd group of rich countries</s>
<s>in business services productivity grew by 09 a year in germany in 200008 against 17 in the oecd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this holds back the economy</s>
<s>potential gdp growth will fall below 1 by 2020 as the population ages says an oecd country survey this week</s>
<s>investment as a share of gdp is well below the norm among g7 economies one reason for those trade surpluses</s>
<s>germany has deficits in education immigration and finance but regulation of services is a big issue</s>
<s>“what sticks out is protection of the liberal professions” says andreas wörgötter at the oecd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>only qualified pharmacists can own a pharmacy and they are limited to four</s>
<s>other shops may not compete even for nonprescription drugs</s>
<s>such rules are typical of the liberal professions which account for a tenth of gdp and employ 42m</s>
<s>they dictate who may offer what sort of service the charges allowed for professionals and how they may advertise</s>
<s>in many professions investment by outsiders is restricted</s>
<s>handwerk which embraces 150 trades from bakery to plumbing and employs 51m has its own rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regulation of professional services is stricter in germany than in all but five of 27 countries ranked by the oecd</s>
<s>when it comes to reserving activities to holders of professional qualifications germany acts more like a stodgy southerner than a nimble northerner</s>
<s>according to a study for the european commission of three sectors in 13 countries germany has more reserved professions than all but one</s>

<p>
<s>an american used to ads trumpeting ambulancechasing lawyers and headacheremedies from walmart would find germany eerily peaceful</s>
<s>doctors practise mostly on their own</s>
<s>lawyers tend to be generalists and work in small groups says markus hartung at the german bar association</s>
<s>deregulation would be disruptive many generalist “country lawyers” could be swept away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but it would have a big payoff</s>
<s>livelier services might encourage the sort of gamechanging innovation that is more common in america than in germany</s>
<s>in the field of legal services “bigger firms would offer more quality at less money” mr hartung believes</s>
<s>new business models would emerge</s>
<s>companies offering legal insurance might buy law firms to handle customers claims for example</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if germany were to reduce services regulation to the level of the most liberal countries it could boost annual productivity growth by a percentage point a year over ten years says one study</s>
<s>wages and domestic demand would rise and the currentaccount surplus would fall</s>
<s>that ought to appeal to chancellor angela merkel who would welcome ways to boost growth without more public spending</s>
<s>germany has already loosened up a bit</s>
<s>prices of nonprescription drugs have been freed and in trades such as brewing a masters certificate is no longer required</s>
<s>but further change will not be easy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>politicians are reluctant to tamper with the handwerk whose apprenticeships keep down unemployment among the young</s>
<s>the liberal professions are largely selfregulating and perform functions that the state might otherwise have to such as setting standards and providing training</s>
<s>quality and competition in german professions compare well with the rest of europe says rolf koschorrek president of the federal association of liberal professions and a bundestag member from mrs merkels own party</s>
<s>mr monti he says “has enough to do in italy</s>
<s>its not necessary to get involved in germanys affairs”</s>
