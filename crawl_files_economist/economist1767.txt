<s>call the state national bank of big spring texas and the person answering says the bank is happy to help at any of its three count’em locations</s>
<s>ask for the chief executive jim purcell and there is a brief pause to check where among the 40 employees he might be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>america still has thousands of these tiny banks</s>
<s>they provide funds and senior managers to customers that may be relegated to automated phonehell at bigger institutions</s>
<s>and in the case of mr purcell they bring a willingness to take a public stand against the government that executives at bigger banks generally prefer to take behind closed doors</s>

<p>
<s>july 21st was the second anniversary of the doddfrank act the massive rewrite of america’s financial system sold as an effort to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis</s>
<s>the birthday came just after in characteristic form a rule tied to doddfrank for mortgage “simplification” was submitted by the newly created consumer financial protection bureau cfpb it runs to 1099 pages a compliance nightmare for small banks and is packed with clauses that could limit the availability of credit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the heads of america’s large financial institutions rail privately about the costly and contradictory demands of the doddfrank act</s>
<s>but their criticism in public is measured out of fear that it could prompt retribution by regulators or make them fodder for bankbashing politicians</s>
<s>it is better they say quietly to lobby for preferential carveouts an approach that may serve their own interests but only adds to the sense of systemic unfairness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>into this mess has stepped mr purcell who notwithstanding the size of his institution $260m in deposits making it the 177thlargest bank in texas has suddenly turned into a rather important banker in america</s>
<s>on june 21st his bank became a plaintiff in a legal challenge brought with two freemarket entities in washington dc the competitive enterprise institute and the 60 plus association arguing that doddfrank is unconstitutional</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr purcell’s business model common among texas rural banks was to keep loans on its books internalising both their returns and their risks</s>
<s>in practice this meant making small loans under $60000 at relatively high rates 7 because small loans suffer from diseconomies of scale with short terms five years to protect the bank against interestrate risk and final “balloon” payments that are usually rolled over</s>
<s>this approach differs radically from that of the major banks which syndicated mortgages through fannie mae and freddie mac</s>
<s>the bank has not repossessed a home in seven years or cost taxpayers a penny but balloon payments and high rates are targeted under doddfrank which grants regulators wide discretion to decide what is “abusive”</s>
<s>mr purcell has stopped issuing mortgages and because of other doddfrank rules processing international remittances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a consequence he concludes some good customers will go to the giant governmentbacked banks and some poorer customers may not get credit at all</s>
<s>his lawsuit attacks two key entities created by doddfrank the cfpb and the financial stability oversight council a group of government officials which can designate which financial institutions are too big to fail—and thus which will receive government support—with the attendant benefit of lower funding costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>each of the entities was given rights that may infringe on powers vested in at least one of the three traditional branches of american government and thus to constitutional checks on power according to the plaintiffs</s>
<s>they cite for example the method the obama administration used to circumvent senate approval which is explicitly required under doddfrank for the appointment of the head of the cfpb and the technique of funding the bureau through mandated payments by the fed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a response by the government could come in august an initial verdict by the upcoming election</s>
<s>an eventual appeal to the supreme court would not be a surprise</s>
<s>mr purcell faces obstacles in his case but its very existence airs important questions about whether efforts to make finance safer have gone too far</s>
