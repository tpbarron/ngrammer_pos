<s>without a sense of mission governments are easily buffeted by events and 2011 will bring plenty from the predictable the alternativevoting referendum in may to the possible crippling strikes</s>
<s>encouragingly the coalition has not one but two missions</s>
<s>as well as shrinking the state the conservatives and the liberal democrats are keen to decentralise it</s>

<s>david camerons “big society” is an oblique term that left voters baffled in the election campaign</s>
<s>the basic idea though is straightforward enough</s>
<s>shifting power to local authorities civic groups and ordinary citizens will the prime minister hopes improve public services and build “social capital”</s>

<s>in september the first “free schools” will open</s>
<s>like the previous governments academies these are funded by the state but independently run</s>
<s>decisions on the curriculum disciplinary policy and staff pay will be taken by the schools themselves</s>
<s>unlike academies which are converted comprehensives free schools are entirely new institutions set up by parents teachers charities or anyone else unhappy with what is on offer locally</s>

<s>opponents of the idea who say only the sharpelbowed rich will get involved in doityourself education come not only from the labour party but the teachers unions quangos and local councils that comprise the educational establishment</s>
<s>they will crow if as is likely merely a dozen or so free schools open in september</s>

<s>the police among the least reformed of all the publicsector professions are in line for a convulsive year</s>
<s>inspired by success stories in american cities such as new york and chicago ministers want constabularies to begin publishing monthly data about local crime in an open and standardised format and answer to the public in regular “beat meetings”</s>
<s>then in the autumn the police reform and social responsibility bill will be passed making every police constabulary in england and wales answerable to an elected official who will be able to set crimefighting priorities and even fire the chief constable</s>
<s>london which already has an elected mayor with influence over the metropolitan police is exempted</s>

<s>consortia of gp commissioners will be set up in pilot form in 2011 as will the new nhs commissioning board which is supposed to ensure basic standards in what could be a chaotic system</s>
<s>any early signs that gps are unwilling or unable to bear the burden of commissioning will be seized upon by sceptics</s>
<s>even champions of greater flexibility in the public services wonder about handing over commissioning funds which account for most of the nhss overall budget of £100 billion $150 billion in england and wales to people trained in medicine rather than finance</s>

<s>welfare reform will also get going</s>
<s>governments have often hidden the true extent of unemployment by putting jobless people on incapacity benefit</s>
<s>the medical reassessment of the 25m claimants of that outofwork payment will begin across the country in 2011</s>
<s>those deemed genuinely unable to work will continue to be looked after the rest will be moved to the less generous jobseekers allowance and be expected to look for work</s>
<s>the welfarereform bill will also be passed beginning the long process of phasing out various benefits altogether and replacing them with a universal payment</s>
<s>the aim is that nobody who takes a job will be worse off than they were on benefits even if this costs the government more money</s>
