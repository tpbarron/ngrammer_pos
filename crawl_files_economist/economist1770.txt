<s>dealings between india and china are stunted in many ways</s>
<s>rich cultural links once existed long ago from the study of eclipses to buddhist chanting but hardly anyone remembers that today laments amartya sen a nobelprizewinning economist</s>
<s>after a lovein during the 1950s china thumped india in a border war in 1962 and the two have continued to growl over their highaltitude frontier since</s>
<s>indians envy chinas economic rise but console themselves by pointing out that it is no democracy</s>
<s>aside from stiff displays of fraternity at summits most recently the g20 bash in mexico on june 18th19th china seems not to think much about india at all</s>
<s>investment flows are negligible</s>
<s>there are still no direct flights between beijing or shanghai and mumbai indias commercial hub</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and yet a huge shift has taken place in the makeup of indian trade</s>
<s>when india began to liberalise its economy in 1991 the west still dominated the world economy and it was to the west that india turned for trade</s>
<s>chinas rise has now changed everything—for india too</s>
<s>china is now its thirdlargest trading partner in goods and the biggest if you include hong kong</s>
<s>for chinas east asian neighbours a dominant trade with china is a given but indians are still trying to digest the development</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rising trade with china has been good for india</s>
<s>it mainly imports chinese capital goods with firms benefiting from cheap and decent gear</s>
<s>the giant reliance group has bought kit for power stations and telecoms networks—partly paid for with competitive chinese loans</s>
<s>chinese firms have often strived to win such business</s>
<s>pan song of shanghai electric which makes power equipment for reliance among others recounts years of hard slog in india</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but for india the china connection is also disconcerting</s>
<s>for every dollars worth of exports to china india imports three leading to a trade deficit of up to $40 billion in the year to march 2012 or about 2 of gdp see chart</s>
<s>china accounts for a fifth of indias overall trade deficit with the world over half if oil is excluded</s>
<s>given indias balanceofpayments woes—the rupee has fallen by a fifth in the past year—even chinese businessmen worry that the discrepancy in bilateral trade is unhealthy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and it may grow larger</s>
<s>for a start the little manufacturing india has tends to be quite highend</s>
<s>as chinese firms shift to more complex forms of production they will make life harder for indian firms</s>
<s>saif qureishi of kryfs which makes the metal cores of transformers used in for example power grids says china has won a third of the indian transformer market and is giving locals “a bloody nose”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile india does not produce much that china wants to buy a hole that british colonial rulers once plugged with exports of indian opium</s>
<s>today indias main exports to china are less iniquitous raw materials mainly minerals and cotton</s>
<s>but their continuing success is not a given</s>
<s>in the past two years the rivers flowing down to goa on indias west coast have teemed with barges carrying iron ore bound for china</s>
<s>yet a crackdown in late 2011 on illegal mining has seen volumes fall by a fifth says atul jadhav of the goa barge owners association</s>
<s>in march india briefly banned cotton exports because of fears of shortages</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>india is indeed prone to protectionist impulses</s>
<s>no bilateral freetrade agreement exists and india often flirts with slapping duties on chinese imports most recently of power equipment</s>
<s>the indian sales of huawei a telecoms firm fell by half after it was hit with antidumping duties and labelled a security risk</s>
<s>chinese firms complain of trouble with visas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more hopefully india wants to boost its exports to china</s>
<s>at the g20 summit it struck a deal to sell more rice</s>
<s>india would also like leading firms in industries including drugs carmaking and it to have better access to china</s>
<s>most already have a presence if only for procurement</s>
<s>yet what is good for indian multinationals may not generate jobs or foreign exchange for india</s>
<s>tata sons with the biggest china operation mainly sells range rover cars made in britain and it services largely employing local chinese staff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and so the trade deficit looks likely to stay</s>
<s>yet china could do more to help finance it if given the chance</s>
<s>more loans from chinese banks would be good—so far india has been wary with only one chinese bank allowed to have a branch there</s>
<s>more foreign direct investment would help too</s>
<s>in 2011 narendra modi the chief minister of gujarat state visited china to drum up investment</s>
<s>more often india seems to regard fdi as the gift of western multinationals alone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it need not be so</s>
<s>in a dusty bit of maharashtra state sits one of the first chinese factories in india run by sany which makes diggers and other construction machines</s>
<s>richard deng its boss says it has invested $70m and employs 460 locals if all goes to plan it will double in size before long</s>
<s>tca</s>
<s>ranganathan chairman of exim bank of india reckons ten chinese firms have or are building plants in india and 100 firms have offices there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite the usual cold sweats foreigners have about india nightmarish red tape a cultural gap chinese executives agree that more local production will take place</s>
<s>sun haiyan of trina solar a solarequipment firm says that as a global company it has to manufacture locally</s>
<s>wu rong of zte a telecoms concern says it employs mainly locals and is producing more in india</s>
<s>huawei its india problems notwithstanding is building a new research campus in bangalore</s>
<s>niu qingbao chinas consul in mumbai says chinese firms are mustardkeen to invest in infrastructure if also a little daunted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>might this be the start of a wave of chinese investment</s>
<s>india needs outside capital and expertise in manufacturing and infrastructure</s>
<s>china must invest its surplus funds abroad ideally not just in government bonds—as mostly happens in america—and ideally in countries that are not about to go belly up as may happen in europe</s>
<s>chinese investment in india is an idea whose time has come if only the two sides can conquer a legacy of mistrust</s>
