<s>the sea of troubles just keeps on coming</s>
<s>gdp shrank in the first quarter of 2012 pushing spain formally into recession for the second time in two years</s>
<s>another 366000 people have lost their jobs bringing the total unemployed to 56m the highest on record</s>
<s>standard  poors a creditrating agency has downgraded spain and 11 of its banks</s>
<s>the madrid stock exchange is back down to 2003 levels as investors pull out</s>
<s>and josé manuel garcíamargallo the foreign minister has said that the european union risks becoming like the titanic with most classes of passengers drowning</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to meet its deficit targets spain has already raised income and company taxes</s>
<s>lower public spending is pushing down consumption</s>
<s>tax rises worth at least €8 billion $105 billion are planned next year hitting consumers further</s>
<s>the recession could then stretch into 2013 with unemployment already a staggering 24 getting worse still</s>
<s>some 3m jobs have gone in four years</s>
<s>the only bright spot is a revival of exports</s>

<p>
<s>nobody could accuse mariano rajoy who has been the centreright prime minister since only late december of inaction</s>
<s>he pledges at least one new reform at every friday cabinet meeting</s>
<s>but even this frenetic activity may not be enough</s>
<s>banks property and the regional governments are the three biggest worries</s>
<s>banks face more damage from the risky lending that primed a burst property bubble</s>
<s>a “bad bank” for the most toxic property assets may still be needed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some government messages have been incoherent</s>
<s>there is confusion about whether a salestax rise is in prospect</s>
<s>as for the regions officials waver between severity threatening to grab financial control from the worst offenders and claims that they can meet their deficit targets without coercion</s>
<s>given their past performance many doubt this</s>
<s>can castile la mancha really cut its deficit from 73 to 15 of regional gdp in a single year</s>
<s>if catalonia or andalusia which accounted for much of last years regional overspending are not on target will there be the time and political will to force them into line</s>

<p>
<s>two possible paths now appear in analysts predictions</s>
<s>some including the imf think that spain will miss its tight deficit targets this year and next but they also expect only modest growth and job creation in 2013</s>
<s>the public debt might then rise to 90 of gdp in five years time</s>
<s>still spain went into the euro crisis with low debt so this would be little worse than in say france</s>
<s> others like the funcas thinktank see mr rajoy applying germanic discipline to hit his deficit targets</s>
<s>that would mean less debt but at a price two years of negative growth with unemployment rising above 26 in 2013</s>

<p>
<s>the first signs of euroscepticism are emerging especially on the left</s>
<s>if germany refuses to back eurobonds it is time to start debating a euro departure says a popular young blogger ignacio escolar</s>
<s>criticising european integration should no longer be seen as resisting progress says ignacio sánchezcuenca of the juan march institute a nonprofit socialresearch body</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such attitudes unusual in a country of euroenthusiasts may matter</s>
<s>mr rajoys government has an absolute majority and almost four years left but if unemployment is not significantly dented by 2015 its prospects are poor</s>
<s>many on the spanish left have been cheering the prospect of a victory for françois hollande the french socialist presidential candidate—not because they think that will open up space for spain to shirk its fiscal targets but to help balance the austerity being imposed on europe by germany with measures to promote growth</s>
