<s>americas trade deficit with china hit another record last year</s>
<s>estimated at almost $300 billion it made up over 40 of americas total deficit</s>
<s>yet official data grossly overstate us imports from china</s>

<s>take the ipad which america imports from china even though it is entirely designed and owned by apple an american company</s>
<s>ipads are assembled in chinese factories owned by foxconn a taiwanese firm largely from parts produced outside china</s>
<s>according to a study by the personal computing industry centre each ipad sold in america adds $275 the total production cost to americas trade deficit with china yet the value of the actual work performed in china accounts for only $10</s>
<s>using these numbers the economist estimates that ipads accounted for around $4 billion of americas reported trade deficit with china in 2011 but if chinas exports were measured on a valueadded basis the deficit was only $150m</s>

<s>the chart shows a geographical breakdown of the retail price of an ipad</s>
<s>the main rewards go to american shareholders and workers</s>
<s>apples profit amounts to about 30 of the sales price</s>
<s>product design software development and marketing are based in america</s>
<s>add in the profits and wages of american suppliers and distribution and retail costs and america retains about half the total value of an ipad sold there</s>
<s>the next biggest gainers are south korean firms like samsung and lg which provide the display and memory chips whose profits account for 7 of an ipads value</s>
<s>the main financial benefit to china is wages paid to workers for assembling the product and for manufacturing some inputsâ€”equivalent to only 2 of the retail price</s>

<s>chinas small contribution to total costs suggests that a yuan appreciation would have little impact on its exports</s>
<s>a 20 rise in the yuan would add less than 1 to the import price of an ipad</s>
<s>for imports such as clothing and toys the chinese value added is much higher</s>
<s>but electrical machinery and equipment with more complex crossborder supply chains make up onequarter of chinas exports to america</s>
<s>pascal lamy the head of the world trade organisation has suggested that if trade statistics reflected true domestic content americas deficit with china might be more than halved</s>
