<p>
<s>it was an english cuvée for a very english day</s>
<s>“nervy” with “an austere honeyed character” was how one winemaker described the bubbly on offer on a wet afternoon at denbies a vineyard in surrey that is also britains largest</s>
<s>nervy and austere too is the connoisseurs traditional view of britishmade wines</s>
<s>but after years of reputational blight the industry is starting to see the buds of progress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>denbies sparkling wine tastes biscuity and refreshing it will soon be the only english bubbly in stock in the classiest houselabel range at sainsburys a big supermarket</s>
<s>denbies rosé was awarded a gold medal at this years international wine challenge and other english and welsh vintages particularly some of the fizzy wines produced by nyetimber and ridgeview in sussex are trumping more venerable competitors on the world stage</s>
<s>british consumers are keen</s>
<s>in 2010 when overall winedrinking dropped by 17 britons downed 176 more domestic sparkling wine than they had the year before and 712 more of the homegrown still stuff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>admittedly this growth is sprouting from a tiny base</s>
<s>domestic crops accounted for around 03 of the 18 billion bottles that british drinkers polished off last year the 4m bottles made from grapes that were grown and produced at home would slake the countrys thirst for less than a day</s>
<s>france by contrast corked and capped no less than 5 billion bottles of local serum in the same period</s>
<s>even so on the muchderided british side of the business any improvement is encouraging</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why now</s>
<s>“its partly climate partly education and partly ambition” says matthew hudson head of the winebusiness course at plumpton college in east sussex</s>
<s>climate change is improving onceuncongenial british conditions harvests are earlier and sunhungry french varieties are replacing hardier germanic vines</s>
<s>richard selley a professor in the earthscience and engineering department of imperial college london and author of a book on vineyards predicts that the wintry slopes of scotland could be home to a “côte dÉcosse” by 2080 see map</s>

<s>the weak pound has made foreign drops pricier and given a boost to local wines says julia trustram eve of the english wine producers association</s>
<s>cannier viticulture and higher professional standards are also bearing fruit</s>
<s>britains winemakers are overcoming the impediment of small harvests—which make technical experimentation commercially risky—by sharing expertise and focusing on topshelf vintages for the discerning buyer</s>
<s>sparkling wines which command high margins are a good bet</s>
<s>the acidic grapes that produce them grow well too in geological antiquity the chalk hills of southern england were attached to the champagne region of northern france</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not everything is rosy</s>
<s>cheap booze known as “british wine” made at home from imported grape juice threatens the reputation of its flashier cousins</s>
<s>even glitzy winemakers sometimes supplement local grapes</s>
<s>there are whispers that the industry has invested too heavily in sparkling wines and may struggle to find a market for all of its output in the future</s>
<s>and climate change is not entirely good news the likelihood of more extreme swings in weather will not make for easy harvests</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still the shortterm future looks bright for britain</s>
<s>gone are the days when as in 2005 the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could boast of sending 24 bottles of italian red to a swedish counterpart who was apparently “aghast” at the welsh and english wines served up at an eu summit</s>
<s>now as mediterranean grapegrowers move north to escape the unseasonable heat they may need to look to newlytemperate britain for inspiration</s>
