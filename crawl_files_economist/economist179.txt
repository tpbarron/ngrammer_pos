<s>the average age of the audience looked well north of 40 at the hustings where six candidates for kent’s police and crime commissioner pcc set out their wares on october 23rd</s>

<s>for the most part the candidates are white men of a certain age</s>
<s>less predictably independents are standing in all but seven areas despite having to find upwards of £25000 for the privilege</s>
