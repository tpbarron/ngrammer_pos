<s>brazil and turkey once reliable backers of americas geostrategic goals conspicuously went their own way in 2010 when they sought to broker a deal with iran over its nuclear programme even as america pushed for new sanctions</s>
<s>their newfound assertiveness was a product of both their growing economic weight and americas diminished clout</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is an example of what is in store for the world predicts ian bremmer in “every nation for itself”</s>
<s>countries like brazil and turkey want the status of a bigger global role</s>
<s>but they “balk at assuming the risks and burdens” that global leadership entails</s>
<s>ideally a web of multilateral institutions and laws would impose order and hold wayward countries in line</s>
<s>but with america unable to afford or unwilling to exercise global leadership and china still not ready to assume its responsibilities there is no one to enforce these rules</s>

<s>in the 1960s president lyndon johnson could divert a fifth of americas wheat crop to alleviate starvation in india</s>
<s>that could not happen now when biofuels are aggravating food shortages and exporters hoard supplies for their own people</s>
<s>global warming nuclear proliferation and internet regulation are all harder to address with the g7 and g20 supplanted by what the author calls the “gzero”</s>

<s>mr bremmer founder of eurasia group a politicalrisk consultancy specialises in big thoughts</s>
<s>his previous books tackled the path that developing countries travel from autocracy to democracy and the growth of statesponsored capitalism</s>
<s>“every nation for itself” enters a more crowded field</s>
<s>innumerable books and essays have already plumbed the consequences of americas loss or possible loss of global leadership with the best providing either fresh insight or original reporting</s>
<s>unfortunately “every nation for itself” does neither</s>
<s>it devotes endless pages to describing disparate arenas of global conflict from cyberspace to water shortages but these are largely a rehash of headlines and conventional wisdom</s>
<s>their only purpose is to provide mr bremmer with repeated opportunities to assert that “in a gzero world” such conflicts can no longer be solved from above</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr bremmer is certainly right that a world without americas global leadership is a more dangerous place but he overstates his case</s>
<s>even when it stood alone as the worlds superpower america struggled to impose its will</s>
<s>in 1993 it pulled its troops out of somalia when murderous warlords foiled its attempts to deliver food relief to the starving country</s>
<s>the global groups that mr bremmer imagines once ran the world were seldom that effective</s>
<s>the g7 occasionally influenced the direction of the dollar or the relations between rich countries and the emerging markets but more often it issued anodyne forgettable communiqués</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>neither america nor the multilateral institutions are as impotent today as mr bremmer claims</s>
<s>brazil and turkey failed in their negotiation over irans nuclear programme</s>
<s>the fact that iran has been dragged back to the negotiating table and myanmar is veering back towards democracy contradict mr bremmers thesis that sanctions are becoming ever less effective</s>
<s>he is right that the world bank and the international monetary fund have been weakened by chinas growing power</s>
<s>but the opposite is true for the world trade organisation whose clout has been enhanced significantly by the fact that both america and china abide by its rulings</s>
<s>“every nation for itself” is a useful summary of current events</s>
<s>but as a guide to a complex world it falls short</s>
