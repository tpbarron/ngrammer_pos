<s>“give me control of a nation’s money supply and i care not who makes its laws” so said mayer amschel rothschild founder of the rothschild banking dynasty</s>
<s>what would he make of bitcoin an online currency with no issuing authority whatsoever</s>
<s>despite being written off following a speculative bubble and crash last year the online cryptocurrency is still going strong not least thanks to its ability to circumnavigate the law</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bitcoin was devised in 2009 by a mysterious figure known as satoshi nakomoto</s>
<s>it is the world’s first and so far only decentralised online currency</s>
<s>instead of a central bank bitcoins can be issued by anyone with a powerful personal computer it mints them by solving extremely difficult mathematical problems</s>
<s>the problems are automatically made harder to ensure that the overall supply of bitcoins cannot grow too fast</s>
<s>they are traded online with transactions cryptographically authenticated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these curious capabilities make bitcoins a combination of a commodity and a fiat currency creating the coins is referred to as “mining” and they have value only because people accept them</s>
<s>but boosters inflated a bitcoin bubble</s>
<s>shortly after the currency launched articles spread around the internet arguing that bitcoins would protect wealth from hyperinflation and that early adopters would make a fortune</s>
<s>the dollar price of a bitcoin currency unit climbed from a few cents in 2010 to a peak of nearly $30 in june 2011 see chart according to data compiled by mt gox a popular online bitcoin exchange</s>
<s>inevitably the currency then crashed back down bottoming out at $2 in november 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but in the nine months since bitcoin has recovered</s>
<s>one unit now costs $12 and the volume of transactions is increasing</s>
<s>though the price still fluctuates against the dollar it is less volatile than it was which makes it a better store of value</s>
<s>its use as a means of exchange is also getting easier an increasing number of online retailers take the currency and new smartphone apps make bitcoins almost as easy to use as cash</s>
<s>a proliferation of exchanges means that it is relatively easy to swap bitcoins for conventional currencies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tony gallippi the boss of bitpay which processes bitcoin payments for retailers says that his client list has increased from around 100 in march to 1100 now</s>
<s>these are mostly ecommerce businesses selling things like domain names and web hosting</s>
<s>but the list also includes a taxidriver in chicago and a dentist in finland</s>
<s>“credit cards weren’t designed for the internet” he says</s>
<s>bitcoin transactions cost less and cannot be reversed in the way creditcard transactions can be</s>
<s>this is important for firms selling to customers in countries known for creditcard fraud such as russia or belarus</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but another big reason for the currency’s success is its role in dodgy online markets</s>
<s>although tracing bitcoin transactions to real people is not impossible the currency’s relative anonymity and ease of use makes it a natural conduit for criminal funds</s>
<s>on the website silk road a sort of ebay for drugs hidden in a dark corner of the web known as tor bitcoins are the only means of transaction</s>
<s>buyers transfer their bitcoins into an escrow account where they sit until receipt of the goods is confirmed</s>
<s>bitcoin transactions on silk road are now worth $19m per month estimates nicolas christin a researcher at carnegie mellon university</s>

<p>
<s>this may explain why users put up with a big drawback</s>
<s>bitcoins tend not to be very secure says richard booth a consultant at rsa a cybersecurity firm</s>
<s>as some users have found to their cost hackers can sometimes steal bitcoins from users’ online vaults</s>
<s>in the latest raid on september 5th hackers stole $250000 in bitcoins from bitfloor a large american exchange causing it to shut down its operation</s>
<s>but although the raid caused a dip in the price of bitcoins it soon recovered</s>
<s>it turns out that a currency can thrive even when no one is making laws for it</s>
