<s>an hour’s drive south of phnom penh deep in rural cambodia chrek heang is doing the rounds of his rapidly expanding poultry and fisheries business</s>
<s>just four years ago he was living like most of his countrymen in a small wooden hut with a tin roof tending to 1000 chickens</s>
<s>now he can chat away in the cavernous living room of his new brickbuilt fivebedroom house the proud owner of 11000 chickens as well as 30000 fish and the employer of five people</s>
<s>in a dirtpoor country like cambodia barely a generation on from the terror of the khmer rouge and a devastating civil war more like mr chrek heang are badly needed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he would never have prospered without three vital loans from a bank an initial one of $10000 followed by another of $25000 and the last of $70000</s>
<s>the lender was the association of cambodian local economic development agencies acleda to give the bank its full and very unsexy title</s>
<s>it was originally set up in 1992 by the united nations and the international labour organisation as a microfinance nongovernmental organisation</s>
<s>the aim then was to support refugees and demobbed fighters at a time when the warravaged country was in tatters</s>
<s>its goals now stretch beyond cambodia’s borders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the back of lending to budding entrepreneurs like mr chrek heang acleda had the largest retailbank network in the country within ten years of its launch</s>
<s>in 2003 acleda became a fully commercial operation and in 2010 it became the largest bank by assets</s>
<s>today it has 237 branches in cambodia a remarkable 63 of the roughly 13m cambodians with a bank account out of a population of 14m have one with acleda</s>
<s>its total loan portfolio is worth over $1 billion about 23 of all the lending in the country</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>acleda is now trying to replicate its success elsewhere in indochina</s>
<s>in 2008 it moved into neighbouring laos where it has 27 branches and growing</s>
<s>but laos with just over 6m people is titchy compared with the bank’s next destination myanmar</s>
<s>other investors are still wary of diving into the swiftly reforming country of about 60m people where a law on foreign direct investment is now stumbling towards approval</s>
<s>but in channy the head of acleda has done his research filled in all the paperwork and expects to get the authorities’ goahead to open his first three branches this month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr in channy pictured is a son of the khmer rouge’s “killing fields”</s>
<s>like millions of others he was evacuated from phnom penh when pol pot took over in 1975 separated from his family and marched off to become a virtuous peasant in the north</s>
<s>his job was to take care of 320 cows</s>
<s>eventually he escaped to a refugee camp in thailand and then got a oneyear scholarship to america to study business management</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a man of no airs and graces mr in channy’s character reflects the bank’s virtues acleda has always stayed close to its original customers the rural poor</s>
<s>there are two or three credit officers in all of the 160 or so of the bank’s smallest branches called “service posts” which are scattered around the cambodian countryside</s>
<s>credit officers are allowed to authorise loans of up to $5000 anything bigger is referred upwards</s>
<s>the service post at russey srok for instance works with six villages of about 3000 families</s>
<s>mao rattha a credit officer there says an average of four people a day come in for a new or repeat loan</s>
<s>credit checks which include interviews with the local authorities neighbours and friends can take one or two days</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr mao rattha says that although he rarely turns anyone down flat threequarters of his time is spent persuading customers to borrow less than they want to</s>
<s>acleda might make less money on its volume of lending but this is made up for by fewer defaults a mere 017 of acleda’s loans are nonperforming</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is this profitable but responsible formula that has attracted the reforming generals in myanmar</s>
<s>their officials have already done a week’s tour of acleda’s operations in cambodia</s>
<s>mr in channy argues that myanmar’s stunted financial sector is ideally suited to the sort of smallloan business that acleda specialises in and has enormous scope for growth</s>
<s>“when we look at credit in myanmar it could be even worse than in cambodia in 1993” he says</s>
<s>eventually acleda might even hop over the myanmar border into yunnan province in southern china</s>
<s>he may be humble but he does not lack ambition</s>
