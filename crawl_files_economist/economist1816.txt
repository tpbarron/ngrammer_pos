<s>ancient artefacts unearthed by archaeologists show that olive oil has been an integral part of mediterranean life for thousands of years</s>
<s>appetite for the stuff has since spread supermarket shelves in northern europe and other rich countries bow under the weight of an array of oils</s>
<s>the mediterranean with its baking summers and warm wet winters usually provides an ideal climate for olive groves</s>
<s>but a drought in spain is having a dramatic impact on the market according to thomas mielke of oil world a research firm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spain is the saudi arabia of olive oil accounting for nearly half of global production</s>
<s>the absence of rain in spain might reduce total global output by around 20 compared with a year ago when the world was awash in over 3m tonnes of olive oil</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>high levels of production then had pushed prices to a nineyear low</s>
<s>but over the past three months the price of extra virgin olive oil the bestquality stuff has risen by over 50 to about $3400 a tonne</s>
<s>stocks left over from last year’s bumper harvest are helping to keep price rises in check but prices over $4000 a tonne are in prospect</s>
<s>and in some respects last year’s overproduction is compounding the problem of the drought</s>
<s>record yields left olive trees weakened by the strain and unable to bear as much fruit this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>high prices are a welcome boost to other parts of southern europe</s>
<s>italy and greece are the nextlargest producers responsible for another 20 of global output</s>
<s>but the surge in prices may also help some parts of the world not usually associated with olive groves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>europe’s big producers have long since looked beyond home markets where consumption has peaked</s>
<s>northern europe whose holidaymakers have become accustomed to the flavours of the south are consuming more olive oil</s>
<s>germans are drizzling five times more and the british nearly ten times more olive oil over their food than in 1990</s>
<s>america is the world’s thirdlargest market with demand growing by almost 6 a year for two decades according to rabobank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bank sniffs an opportunity for california’s olive growers</s>
<s>higher prices for imports the chance that the eu will cut subsidies and longrunning concerns over the quality of imports “extra virgin” is a loose category all stand to improve the competitiveness of costlier californian oil</s>
<s>american olive oil might grab as much as 5 of the domestic market by 2017 says rabobank</s>
<s>highquality oil imported from newcomers such as australia and chile also stands to gain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spanish oliveoil exporters are unconcerned</s>
<s>australian presses squeeze out just 20000 tonnes a year and california’s merely 7000 tonnes compared with 1m tonnes from spain</s>
<s>maybe they should fret more</s>
<s>europe’s winemakers also dominant since antiquity ignored the early signs of the rise of new world vintners</s>
