<s>india now has three army corps—about 100000 troops—in its far northeastern state of arunachal pradesh which includes tawang</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with another corps in reserve and a few sukhoi fighter planes deployed last year to neighbouring assam they are a meaty border force unlike their hapless predecessors</s>
<s>in 1962 many indian troops were sent shivering to the front in light cotton uniforms issued for punjabs fiery plains</s>
<s>in a weeklong assault the chinese seized much of arunachal as well as a slab of kashmir in the western himalayas and killed 3000 indian officers and men</s>
<s>outside tawangs district headquarters a roadside memorial built in the local buddhist style commemorates these dead</s>

<p>
<s>his ambivalence is widely shared</s>
<s>china and india repositories of 40 of the worlds people are often unsure what to make of each other</s>
<s>since reestablishing diplomatic ties in 1976 after a postwar pause they and their relationship have in many ways been transformed</s>
<s>the 1962 war was an act of chinese aggression most obviously springing from chinas desire for western aksai chin a lofty plain linking xinjiang to tibet</s>
<s>but its deeper causes included a famine in china and economic malaise in both countries</s>
<s>china and india are now the worlds fastestgrowing big economies however and in a year or two when india overtakes japan on a purchasingpowerparity basis they will be the worlds second and thirdbiggest</s>
<s>and as they grow asias giants have come closer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their twoway trade is roaring only $270m in 1990 it is expected to exceed $60 billion this year</s>
<s>they are also tentatively cooperating for their mutual enrichment in other ways for example by coordinating their bids for the african oil supplies that both rely on</s>
<s>given their contrasting economic strengths—chinas in manufacturing indias in services—some see an opportunity for much deeper cooperation</s>
<s>there is even a word for this vision “chindia”</s>
<s>on important international issues notably climatechange policy and world trade their alignment is already imposing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their leaders naturally talk up these pluses at the summit of the brics brazil russia india china in brasília in april for example and during celebrations in beijing earlier this year to commemorate the 60th anniversary of indias recognition of the peoples republic</s>
<s>“india and china are not in competition” indias sagelike prime minister manmohan singh often says</s>
<s>“there is enough economic space for us both”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chinas president hu jintao says the same</s>
<s>and no doubt both want to believe it</s>
<s>the booms in their countries have already moved millions out of poverty especially in china which is far ahead on almost every such measure of progress and also dismissive of the notion that india could ever rival it</s>
<s>a return to confrontation besides hugely damaging the improved image of both countries would plainly jeopardise this movement forward</s>
<s>that is why the secular trend in chinaindia relations is positive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet china and india are in many ways rivals not asian brothers and their relationship is by any standard vexed—as recent quarrelling has made abundantly plain</s>
<s>if you then consider that they are despite their mutual good wishes old enemies bad neighbours and nuclear powers and have two of the worlds biggest armies—with almost 4m troops between them—this may seem troubling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>forget chindia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are many caveats to the recent improvement in their relationship</s>
<s>as the worlds oil wells run dry many—including sober analysts in both countries—foresee chinaindia rivalry redrawn as a cutthroat contest for an increasingly scarce resource</s>
<s>the two oilgluggers recent cooperation on energy was after all as unusual as it was tentative</s>
<s>more often chinese statebacked energy firms compete with allcomers for sudanese oil and burmese gas and win</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rivalry over gas supplies is a bigger concern for indian policymakers</s>
<s>they fear china would be more able to “capture” gas by building massive pipelines overnight</s>
<s>water is already an object of contention given that several of the big rivers of north india including the brahmaputra on which millions depend rise in tibet</s>
<s>china recently announced that it is building a dam on the brahmaputra which it calls the yarlung tsangpo exacerbating an old indian fear that the beijing regime means to divert the rivers waters to chinese farmers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for chindia it can seem almost too naive to bother about</s>
<s>over 70 of indias exports to china by value are raw materials chiefly iron ore bespeaking a colonialstyle trade relationship that is hugely favourable to china</s>
<s>a proliferating range of chinese nontariff barriers to indian companies which india grumbles about is a small part of this</s>
<s>the fault lies chiefly with indias uncompetitive manufacturing</s>
<s>it is currently cheaper an indian businessman says ruefully to export plastic granules to china and then import them again in bucketform than it is to make buckets in india</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is a source of tension</s>
<s>indias great priority is to create millions of jobs for its young bulging and littleskilled population which will be possible only if it makes huge strides in manufacturing</s>
<s>similarly if china trails india in it services at present its recent investments in the industry suggest it does not plan to lag for long</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet there is another more obvious bone of contention which exacerbates all these others and lies at the root of them the 4000km border that runs between the two countries</s>
<s>nearly half a century after chinas invasion it remains largely undefined and bitterly contested</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the basic problem is twofold</s>
<s>in the undefined northern part of the frontier india claims an area the size of switzerland occupied by china for its region of ladakh</s>
<s>in the eastern part china claims an indianoccupied area three times bigger including most of arunachal</s>
<s>this 890km stretch of frontier was settled in 1914 by the governments of britain and tibet which was then in effect independent and named the mcmahon line after its creator sir henry mcmahon foreign secretary of britishruled india</s>
<s>for china—which was afforded mere observer status at the negotiations preceding the agreement—the mcmahon line represents a dire humiliation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china also particularly resents being deprived of tawang which—though south of the mcmahon line—was occupied by indian troops only in 1951 shortly after chinas new communist rulers dispatched troops to tibet</s>
<s>this district of almost 40000 people scattered over 2000 square kilometres of valley and high mountains was the birthplace in the 17th century of the sixth dalai lama the incumbent incarnation is the 14th</s>
<s>tawang is a centre of tibets buddhist culture with one of the biggest tibetan monasteries outside lhasa</s>
<s>traditionally its ethnic monpa inhabitants offered fealty to tibets rulers—which those aged peasants around tawang also remember</s>
<s>“the tibetans came for money and did nothing for us” said mr nansey referring to the furcloaked tibetan officials who until the late 1940s went from village to village extracting a share of the harvest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>making matters worse the mcmahon line was drawn with a fat nib establishing a tenkilometre margin for error and it has never been demarcated</s>
<s>with more confusion in the central sector bordering indias northern state of uttarakhand there are in all a dozen stretches of frontier where neither side knows where even the disputed border should be</s>
<s>in these “pockets” as they are called indian and chinese border guards circle each other endlessly while littering the himalayan hillsides—as dogs mark lampposts—to make their presence known</s>
<s>when chinaindia relations are strained this gives rise to titfortat and mostly bogus accusations of illegal border incursions—for which each side can offer the others empty cigarette and noodle packets as evidence</s>
<s>in official indian parlance such proof is grimly referred to as “telltale signs”</s>
<s>it is plainly garbage</s>
<s>yet this is a carefully rehearsed and mutually comprehensible ritual for which both sides deserve credit of a sort</s>
<s>despite several threatened dustups—including one in 1986 that saw 200000 indian troops rushed to northern tawang district—there has been no confirmed exchange of fire between indian and chinese troops since 1967</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hands extended—and withdrawn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it would be even better if the two countries would actually settle their dispute and until recently that seemed imaginable</s>
<s>the obvious solution whereby both sides more or less accept the status quo exchanging just a few bits of turf to save face was long ago advocated by china including in the 1980s by the then prime minister deng xiaoping</s>
<s>indias leaders long considered this politically impossible</s>
<s>but in 2003 a coalition government led by the hindunationalist bharatiya janata party—which in 1998 had cited the chinese threat to justify its decision to test a nuclear bomb—launched an impressive bid for peace</s>
<s>for the first time india declared itself ready to compromise on territory and china appeared ready to meet it halfway</s>
<s>both countries appointed special envoys who have since met 13 times to lead the negotiations that followed</s>
<s>this led to an outline deal in 2005 containing the “guiding principles and political parameters” for a final settlement</s>
<s>those included an agreement that it would involve no exchange of “settled populations”—which implied that china had dropped its historical demand for tawang</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the hopes this inspired have faded</s>
<s>in ad hoc comments from chinese diplomats and through its statecontrolled media—which often refer to arunachal as chinese south tibet—china appears to have reasserted its demand for most of indias far northeastern state</s>
<s>annoying the indians further it started issuing special visas to indians from arunachal and kashmir—after having denied a visa to an indian official from arunachal on the basis that he was in fact chinese</s>
<s>it also objected to a $60m loan to india from the asian development bank on the basis that some of the money was earmarked for irrigation schemes in arunachal</s>
<s>its spokesman described a visit to tawang by mr singh ahead of a general election last year as “provocative and dangerous”</s>
<s>chinese analysts warn against understanding from these hints that china has formally revised its position on the border</s>
<s>but that is indias suspicion</s>
<s>and no one in either country is predicting a border settlement soon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in fact the relationship has generally soured</s>
<s>having belatedly woken up to the huge improvements china has made in its border infrastructure enabling a far swifter mobilisation of chinese troops there india announced last year that it would deploy another 60000 troops to arunachal</s>
<s>it also began upgrading its airfields in assam and deploying the sukhois to them</s>
<s>indias media meanwhile reported a spate of “incursions” by chinese troops</s>
<s>chinas statecontrolled media was more restrained with striking exceptions</s>
<s>last year an editorial in the global times an englishlanguage tabloid in beijing warned that “india needs to consider whether or not it can afford the consequences of a potential confrontation with china” early this year indias outgoing national security adviser and special envoy to china mk</s>
<s>narayanan accused chinese hackers of attacking his website as well as those of other indian government departments</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>recent diplomacy has brought more calm</s>
<s>officials on both sides were especially pleased by their show of unity at the united nations climate meeting in copenhagen last december where china and india the worlds biggest and fourthbiggest emitters of carbon gas faced down americanled demands for them to undertake tougher antiwarming measures</s>
<s>a slight cooling in the americaindia relationship which president george bush had pushed with gusto has also helped</s>
<s>so india hopes has its appointment of a shrewd mandarinspeaker shivshankar menon as its latest national security adviser and special envoy to china</s>
<s>he made his first visit to beijing in this role last month a 14th round of border talks is expected</s>
<s>and yet the chinaindia relationship has been bruised</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>negative views</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in china whose communist leaders are neither voluble nor particularly focused on india this bruising is mostly clear from last years quarrel itself</s>
<s>the chinese many of whom consider india a dirty thirdrate sort of place were perhaps most obviously to blame for it</s>
<s>this is despite chinas conspicuous recent success in settling its other land disputes including with russia and vietnam—a fact chinese commentators often cite to indicate indian intransigence</s>
<s>chinese public opinion also seems to be turning against india a country the chinese have been wont to remark on fondly if at all as the birthplace of buddhism</s>
<s>according to a recent survey of global opinion released by the bbc the chinese show a “distinct cooling” towards india which 47 viewed negatively</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in garrulous democratic india the fallout is easier to gauge</s>
<s>according to the bbc poll 38 of indians have a negative view of china</s>
<s>in fact this has been more or less the case since the defeat of 1962</s>
<s>lamenting the failure of indian public opinion to move on patricia uberoi a sociologist at delhis centre for the study of developing societies notes that while there have been many indian films on the subcontinents violent partition including starcrossed indopakistani romances there has been only one notable indian movie on the 1962 war a propaganda film called “haqeeqat” or “truth” supported by the indian defence ministry</s>

<p>
<s>hawkish indian commentators are meanwhile up in arms</s>
<s>“china in my view does not want a rival in asia” says brajesh mishra a former national security adviser and special envoy to china who drafted the 2005 agreement and is revered by the hawks</s>
<s>“its main agenda is to keep india preoccupied with events in south asia so it is constrained from playing a more important role in asian and global affairs” senior officials present a more nuanced analysis noting for example that india has hardly been alone in getting heat from china many countries asian and western have similarly been singed</s>
<s>yet they admit to heightened concern over chinas intentions in south asia and foresee no hope for a settlement of the border</s>
<s>nicholas burns a former american diplomat who led the negotiations for an americaindia nuclear cooperation deal that was concluded in 2008 and who now teaches at harvard university suspects that over the past year china has supplanted pakistan as the main worry of indian policymakers</s>
<s>he considers the chinaindia relationship “exceedingly troubled and perturbed” and thinks that it will remain “uneasy for many years to come”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fear of encirclement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for foreignpolicy realists who see china and india locked in a battle for asian supremacy this is inevitable</s>
<s>even fixing the border could hardly mitigate the tension</s>
<s>more optimistic analysts and there are many even if currently hushed consider this oldschool nonsense</s>
<s>though both india and china have their rabid fringe they say they are rational enough to know that a strategic struggle would be sapping and given each others vast size unwinnable</s>
<s>both are therefore committed as they claim to fixing the border and fostering better relations</s>
<s>yet there are a few impediments to this—of which two are most often cited by analysts in beijing and delhi</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one is represented by the americaindia nuclear deal agreed in principle between mr singh and mr bush in 2005</s>
<s>not unreasonably china took this as a sign that america wanted to use india as a counterweight to chinas rise</s>
<s>it also considered the pact hypocritical america while venting against chinas ally north korea going nuclear which it did a year later was offering india a free pass to nuclearpower status despite its refusal to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty</s>
<s>indian analysts believe that china in a cautious way tried to scupper the deal by encouraging some of its opponents including ireland and sweden to vote against it in the nuclear suppliers group a 46member club from which it required unanimous approval</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this glitch reflects a bigger chinese fear of encirclement by america and its allies a fear heightened by a recent burst of american activity in asia</s>
<s>the united states has sought to strengthen security ties with southeast asian countries including vietnam and indonesia</s>
<s>it has also called on china in an unusually public fashion to be more accommodating over contested areas of the south china sea—where america and india share concerns about a chinese naval buildup including the construction of a nuclearsubmarine base on the chinese island of hainan</s>
<s>in northeast asia america has launched military exercises with south korea in response to north koreas alleged sinking of a south korean warship in march</s>
<s>some chinese analysts with ties to the government consider these a direct challenge to china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china is deeply suspicious of americas military campaign in nearby afghanistan and covertly in pakistan which is supported from bases in central asian countries</s>
<s>it is also unimpressed by a growing closeness between india and japan its main asian rival</s>
<s>japanese firms are for example expected to invest $10 billion and perhaps much more in a 1500km “industrial corridor” between delhi and mumbai</s>
<s>in 2007 japanese warships took part in a naval exercise in the bay of bengal also involving indian australian and singaporean ships and the american nuclearpowered vessels uss nimitz and uss chicago which was hosted by india and was the biggest ever held in the region</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this seemed to back a proposal put about by american thinktankers for an “axis of democracies” to balance china</s>
<s>officially india would want no part of this</s>
<s>“we dont want to balance china” says a senior indian official</s>
<s>but he adds “all the democracies do feel it is safer to be together</s>
<s>is china going to be peaceful or not</s>
<s>we dont know</s>
<s>in the event that china leaves the path of peaceful rise we would work very closely together”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>india also fears encirclement and with reason</s>
<s>americas pentagon in an annual report on chinas military power released on august 16th said chinas armed forces were developing “new capabilities” that might extend their reach into the indian ocean</s>
<s>china has also made big investments in all indias neighbours</s>
<s>it is building deepwater ports in pakistan and bangladesh roads in nepal and oil and gas pipelines in myanmar</s>
<s>worse it agreed in 2008 to build two nuclearpower plants for its main regional ally pakistan—a deal that also worried america who saw it as a titfortat response to its nuclear deal with india</s>
<s>china has become pakistans biggest supplier of military hardware including fighter jets and guidedmissile frigates and in the past has given it weaponsgrade fissile material and a tested bomb design as part of its nuclear support</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>muffling tibet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hawkish indians consider these chinese investments as a “string of pearls” to throttle india</s>
<s>wiser ones point out that india is too big to throttle—and that chinas rising influence in south asia is an indictment of indias past inability to get on with almost any of its neighbours</s>
<s>under mr singh india has sought to redress this</s>
<s>it is boosting trade with sri lanka and bangladesh and sticking with commendable doggedness in the face of little encouragement to the task of making peace with pakistan</s>
<s>that would be glorious for both countries it would also remove a significant chinaindia bugbear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other great impediment to better relations is tibet</s>
<s>its fugitive dalai lama and his “governmentinexile” have found refuge in india since 1959—and china blames him and by extension his hosts for the continued rebelliousness in his homeland</s>
<s>a tibetan uprising in march 2008 the biggest in decades was therefore a major factor in last years chinaindia spat</s>
<s>it led to china putting huge pressure on india to stifle the antichina tibetan protests that erupted in india—especially one intended to disrupt the passage of the olympic torch through delhi en route to beijing</s>
<s>it also objected to a visit to tawang by the dalai lama last november which it predictably called a “separatist action”</s>
<s>this visit from which leftover banners of welcome still festoon the towns main bazaar perhaps reminded china why it is so fixated on tawang—as a centre of the tibetan buddhist culture that it is struggling all too visibly to control</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mindful of the huge support the dalai lama enjoys in india its government says it can do little to restrict him</s>
<s>yet it policed the protest tightly and also barred foreign journalists from accompanying him to tawang</s>
<s>india would perhaps rather be spared discreet balancing acts of this sort</s>
<s>“but were stuck with him hes our guest” says vr</s>
<s>raghavan a retired indian general and veteran of the 1962 war</s>
<s>indeed many indian pundits consider that china will never settle the border and so relinquish a potential source of leverage over india while the 75yearold lama is alive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after his death china will attempt to control his holy office as it has those of other senior lamas</s>
<s>it will “discover” the reincarnated dalai lama in tibet or at least endorse the choice of its agents and attempt to groom him into a more biddable monk</s>
<s>in theory that would end a major cause of chinaindia discord but only if the chinese can convince tibetans that their choice is the right one which seems unlikely</s>
<s>the dalai lama has already indicated that he may choose to be “reborn” outside china</s>
<s>there is talk of the important role tawang has often played in identifying incarnations of the dalai lama or even that the 14th may choose to reincarnate in tawang itself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the abbot of tawangs main monastery guru tulku rinpoche that would be a great blessing</s>
<s>“if his holiness chooses to be born in tawang we would be so happy” he says in his redcarpeted monastic office as half a dozen skinny lads file in to be inducted into monkhood</s>
<s>silently they prostrate themselves before the abbot while he scribbles down their new monastic names</s>
<s>outside his window the early morning sun sparkles through the white clouds that hang low over tawang</s>
<s>it is hard to think that this remote and tranquil spot could have caused such a continentsized ruckus</s>
<s>yet if the abbot has his wish it will cause a lot more trouble yet</s>
