<s>money is perhaps the most basic buildingblock in economics</s>
<s>it helps states collect taxes to fund public goods</s>
<s>it allows producers to specialise and reap gains from trade</s>
<s>it is clear what it does but its origins are a mystery</s>
<s>some argue that money has its roots in the power of the state</s>
<s>others claim the origin of money is a purely private matter it would exist even if governments did not</s>
<s>this debate is longrunning but it informs some of the most pressing monetary questions of today</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money fulfils three main functions</s>
<s>first it must be a medium of exchange easily traded for goods and services</s>
<s>second it must be a store of value so that it can be saved and used for consumption in the future</s>
<s>third it must be a unit of account a useful measuringstick</s>
<s>lots of things can do these jobs</s>
<s>tea salt and cattle have all been used as money</s>
<s>in britain’s prisons inmates currently favour showergel capsules or rosary beads</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the use of money stretches back millennia</s>
<s>electrum an alloy of gold and silver was used to make coins in lydia now western turkey in around 650bc</s>
<s>the first paper money circulated in china in around 1000ad</s>
<s>the aztecs used cocoa beans as cash until the 12th century</s>
<s>the puzzle is how people agreed what to use</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>karl menger an austrian economist set out one school of thought as long ago as 1892</s>
<s>in his version of events the monetisation of an economy starts when agricultural communities move away from subsistence farming and start to specialise</s>
<s>this brings efficiency gains but means that trade with others becomes necessary</s>
<s>the problem is that operating markets on the basis of barter is a pain you have to scout around looking for the rare person who wants what you have and has what you want</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>money evolves to reduce barter costs with some things working better than others</s>
<s>the commodity used as money should not lose value when it is bought and sold</s>
<s>so clothing is a bad money since no one places the same value on secondhand clothes as new ones</s>
<s>instead something that is portable durable fruit and vegetables are out and divisible into smaller pieces is needed</s>
<s>menger called this property “saleableness”</s>
<s>spices and shells are highly saleable explaining their use as money</s>
<s>government plays no role here</s>
<s>the origin of money is a marketled response to barter costs in which the best money is that which minimises the costs of trade</s>
<s>menger’s is a good description of how informal monies such as those used by prisoners originate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the story just doesn’t match the facts in most monetary economies according to a 1998 paper by charles goodhart of the london school of economics</s>
<s>take the widespread use of precious metals as money</s>
<s>a mengerian would say that this happens because metals are durable divisible and portable that makes them an ideal medium of exchange</s>
<s>but it is incredibly hard to value raw metals mr goodhart argued so the cost of using them in trade is high</s>
<s>it is much easier to assess the value of a bag of salt or a cow than a lump of metal</s>
<s>raw metals fail menger’s own saleableness test</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this problem explains why metal money has circulated not in lumps but as coins with a regulated amount of metal in each coin</s>
<s>but history shows that minting developed not as a privatesector attempt to minimise the costs of trading but as a government operation</s>
<s>it was state intervention not the private market that made metal specie work as money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that suggests another theory is needed in which the state plays a bigger role in the origin of money</s>
<s>mr goodhart called this the “cartalist” theory</s>
<s>the fiscal wing of government has a huge incentive to move its economy away from barter</s>
<s>once money exists income and expenditure can be measured</s>
<s>that means they can be taxed</s>
<s>and the public purse gets a second boost from seigniorage the difference between the value of the coins and the cost of producing them</s>
<s>on this account governments impose taxes payable only in money creating a demand for money that means it will be widely accepted as payment for goods</s>
<s>the state forces the economy away from barter for its own fiscal purposes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr goodhart used monetary history to test these competing theories</s>
<s>he examined the overthrow of rome and a period in the tenth century when the japanese government stopped minting coins</s>
<s>if the origin of money were purely private these shocks should have had no monetary effects</s>
<s>but after rome’s collapse traders resorted to barter in japan they started to use rice instead of coins</s>
<s>there is a clear link between fiscal power and money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the struggle for life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the evidence suggests that only “informal” monies can spring up purely privately</s>
<s>but informal money can exist on the grandest scale</s>
<s>the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency is not mandated by any government for example</s>
<s>its preeminence outside america rests on it being the best option for international transactions</s>
<s>once a competitor currency becomes preferable firms and other governments will move on</s>
<s>the good news for the dollar is that the chinese yuan is not yet widely accepted and suffers from higher inflation reducing its usefulness</s>
<s>but a shift in the world’s reserve currency could be swifter than many assume</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dollar’s other competitor the euro has deeper problems</s>
<s>its origins were not private</s>
<s>nor is it a proper cartalist money backed by a nation state</s>
<s>this means it lacks a foundation in the power of either the market or the state</s>
<s>in his paper written a year before the euro was introduced mr goodhart was prescient highlighting “an unprecedented divorce between the main monetary and fiscal authorities”</s>
<s>cartalists he said “worry whether the divorce may not have some unforeseen side effects”</s>
