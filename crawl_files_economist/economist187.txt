<s>mali is one of those african countries that few outsiders take much notice of—until a disaster threatens especially one that may have bloody repercussions beyond its borders</s>
<s>such a moment arrived earlier this year when an ethnic insurrection in the northern half of the country a patch of desert as big as france was hijacked by a clutch of extreme islamist groups some of them tied to alqaeda in the maghreb the terrorist franchise on the arabs’ western fringe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since then it has dawned on the rest of the world especially the united states and europe but also nervous african governments in mali’s vicinity that the country may be turning into a haven for alqaeda and its local copycats much as befell somalia yemen and afghanistan</s>
<s>last month the un security council unanimously passed a resolution that paved the way for military intervention requiring—among other things—the creation of an international force to help mali’s army rescue the country from the jihadists</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the council is right to recommend intervention but the resolution demanded that a detailed action plan should be drawn up before the end of november</s>
<s>sticking rigidly to that deadline could imperil the plan</s>
<s>getting the plan right is more important than implementing it speedily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the case for stopping the jihadists is hard to deny</s>
<s>they are already making life a misery—complete with floggings and handchoppings—for malians under their sway in such places as timbuktu once a bastion of tolerance fabled for its music marvellous shrines and ancient manuscripts</s>
<s>just as bad are the deadly ripples that could spread far beyond mali even to europe and america if the jihadists were allowed to entrench themselves see article</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the un wants to combine african leadership and manpower with western military muscle and knowhow</s>
<s>this excludes american or european boots on the ground except for some training staff but it would give african troops intelligence logistics aerial firepower and surveillance including drones and perhaps small contingents of special forces from america and france the former colonial power that has been in the forefront of the campaign to restore mali</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but intervening has many pitfalls</s>
<s>neither the malian army nor the forces of the other 14 countries in the economic community of west african states ecowas the nigeriandominated regional club that has been keenest to see off the jihadists can defeat the determined northern rebels on their own</s>
<s>the security council should therefore call on other governments outside europe and north america to help</s>
<s>algeria mali’s northern neighbour and the region’s beefiest country which has argued bitterly against western interference in libya and elsewhere in the arab world in the past two years also needs to be persuaded to oppose the jihadists wholeheartedly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the foreigners could also help inside the country</s>
<s>the northern islamists are a mixed bunch some of the ethnic tuareg leaders may yet be peeled away from alqaeda</s>
<s>mali’s transitional government also looks fragile—a stopgap president backed edgily by a military cabal that reluctantly ceded power on paper after grabbing it in march in a coup</s>
<s>outsiders could offer development assistance to the north and broker a deal with those who are amenable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>look before you leap</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this will take time</s>
<s>the trick is not to rush into mali but to apply force as part of a coherent military and political plan</s>
<s>the lesson from similar operations in somalia is that sound preparations pay dividends</s>
<s>better to miss the un’s deadline even by some months than to plunge recklessly in</s>
