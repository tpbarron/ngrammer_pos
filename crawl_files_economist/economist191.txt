<s>even without the buffeting britain will receive from storms in the global economy—which will prompt a frantic search for growth and could yet force mr osborne to reconsider the pacing of his plans to shrink the budget deficit—it will be a turbulent year</s>

<s>the conservatives hope to please voters who resent paying for welfare recipients to live in areas they could never afford</s>
<s>but the government is braced for headlines about hardup families forced to move out of london criticism from antipoverty charities and unease among lib dems</s>
