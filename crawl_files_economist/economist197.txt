<s>count the reasons why 2012 or soon after should mark the end of the road for many of indias more prominent politicians</s>
<s>the country looks troublingly gerontocratic</s>
<s>the head of state president pratibha patil turns 78 in 2012</s>
<s>she is pliable for the ruling congress party but her current fiveyear term expires in july</s>
<s>certainly younger better alternatives exist for example the defence minister ak</s>
<s>antony is a decade or so younger and enjoys a rare reputation for probity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the presidency is mostly ceremonial</s>
<s>more important daytoday is the prime minister manmohan singh</s>
<s>it is hard to imagine a congress government without him</s>
<s>he has been around for ever as finance minister two decades ago he liberalised the economy</s>
<s>his international standing passive nature technocratic skills and readiness to defer on most political issues are all treasured by his party boss sonia gandhi</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the gentle mr singh who turns 80 in 2012 should also think of retirement soon</s>
<s>the past year has left bruises his government has been beset by a series of corruption scandals that tarnished him as weak evasive and out of touch</s>
<s>worse he has let ministers drift along without delivering any big policy reform</s>
<s>his finance minister pranab mukherjee a stripling at 76 spends more time tackling political crises than keeping promises of a new goodsandservices tax lifting caps on foreign investment in insurance and retail or getting money spent on infrastructure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>something has been achieved a big rise in welfare spending especially in rural areas that has helped to boost incomes of villagers</s>
<s>but overall the economy suffers from high inflation sliding investment and weakening growth</s>
<s>gloomier analysts talk of indias economy notching up less than 8 gdp growth in 2012—slack by recent standards and well below old dreams of rivalling china</s>
<s>the result will be more sniping against mr singh</s>
<s>rural folk may be better off but the urban middle classes are getting grumpier</s>
<s>his value as an asset to the party is waning</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is awkward especially as he prepares for a series of big elections national ones are just over two years away at most and as congress thinks of its primeministerial candidate</s>
<s>that decision rests with mrs gandhi the real centre of power</s>
<s>but her strength—political and personal—is also uncertain</s>
<s>officials said out of the blue in august that she was absent suffering from a serious and unnamed illness</s>
<s>reportedly she was getting cancer treatment in a new york hospital</s>
<s>her month away and weeks of convalescence startled the ruling party</s>
<s>now short of an official explanation of what ails her doubts are likely to persist and grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the result will be more pressure on her son rahul gandhi to get ready for a bigger role perhaps as party chief or prime minister—even both</s>
<s>dynastic politics still matter enormously in india avid watchers of the gandhi family will look for any sign that priyanka rahuls sister is interested in taking up politics too</s>
<s>yet to be credible rahul needs to show a much surer touch</s>
<s>the young scion is shy of the press timid in parliament preferring to toil at party reorganisation and getting young candidates elected in state elections</s>
<s>so far however his record is poor</s>
<s>he ran lacklustre campaigns in state elections in bihar and kerala in the past year</s>
<s>nor did he show any leadership in response to an anticorruption crusader anna hazare 75 who launched two noisily popular fasts that wrongfooted the government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2012 in theory mr gandhi gets a chance to turn things around he is charged with reversing congresss poor showing in the northern state of uttar pradesh up home to 200m people</s>
<s>yet polls show congress struggling to avoid fourth place in up with mr gandhis efforts in the state so far getting little traction even though his own constituency is there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>country for old men</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>along with up six states hold assembly polls in 2012 notably the northern ones of punjab gujarat and uttarakhand where the opposition bharatiya janata party bjp is strong</s>
<s>some observers talk of 2012 as a “mini” generalelection year</s>
<s>if the opposition does well it may crow about being able to build strong alliances for the real general election of 2014</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before then however the bjp will have to tackle an oldleadership problem of its own</s>
<s>several bosses including parliamentary and faction leaders of different hues plus narendra modi chief minister of gujarat are jostling to be the primeministerial candidate</s>
<s>now a veteran lk</s>
<s>advani has grabbed the spotlight with an anticorruption pilgrimage in up as he hankers for one last chance to be prime minister</s>
<s>yet letting him run would be the only sure way for the opposition to make congresss leaders look young again in 2012 mr advani turns 85</s>
