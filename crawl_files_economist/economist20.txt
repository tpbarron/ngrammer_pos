<s>uprisings are a messy business but syria’s has been messier than most</s>
<s>as the bloodshed covers ever more of the country and the hold of president bashar assad’s regime weakens the opposition seems only to grow more fractious</s>
<s>syrian politicians in exile remain disconnected from local activists inside</s>
<s>while rebels of a moderate secular bent warily eye salafist fighters emerging civilian and military leaders tussle over who should administer liberated towns and villages</s>
<s>with lakhdar brahimi the un’s peace envoy pleading that syria risks becoming a “new somalia” unless there are negotiations outside powers are having another go at unifying mr assad’s opponents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in doha qatar’s capital a gathering of them is being prodded into backing a plan proposed by riad seif pictured a prominent exmember of parliament and veteran opponent of the assad regime who is unusually respected both inside and outside syria</s>
<s>the syrian national initiative is his blueprint for a new 50person body to include more young leaders on the ground and to act as a sort of protogovernment planning for a political transition and serving as the sole channel for funding local civilian councils</s>
<s>it would also set up a body to liaise with military groups</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unsurprisingly this has disgruntled the syrian national council snc an umbrella grouping that has hitherto posed as the opposition’s main representative but which would have just 15 seats in the new body</s>
<s>the snc’s leader abdulbaset sieda insists that his council should remain the cornerstone of any new arrangement</s>
<s>but its record of political naivety and bickering and the poor representation within it of anyone inside syria though more ontheground activists were recently added in a lastditch effort to give the snc more heft has dismayed impatient foreign governments as much as mr assad’s assorted syrian opponents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tired of the snc most syrians in the opposition camp welcome this belated focus on grassroots figures</s>
<s>western and other governments say they will boost funding to syrian civilians if there is a more unified and responsible body to deal with</s>
<s>mr seif has hinted that promises have been made of direct arms supplies from western countries which have hitherto shied from handing guns to myriad factions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however on november 6th david cameron britain’s prime minister again said that his government had no plans for the time being to provide the rebels with arms</s>
<s>western diplomats are adamant that the new body will be political though its relationship with the fighting rebels is bound to be murky</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>arms many of them provided by the rebels’ libyan qatari and saudi friends will continue to be channelled mainly via the turks whose government now suggests it could host patriot airdefence batteries under nato auspices to shield a possible safe haven along its border with syria</s>
<s>protection from air attacks by mr assad’s forces has been a longstanding opposition demand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but such carrots may not be enough to persuade the opposition to come amicably together</s>
<s>some dissidents bristle at what they see as highhanded manipulation by the united states whose openly exasperated diplomats have moreorless told the snc and others to accept mr seif’s proposal or lump it</s>
<s>other syrians in the opposition fear that unification would be followed by pressure from friendly foreign governments to negotiate with the regime</s>
<s>they point variously to mr brahimi’s comments that there is no military solution and to mr cameron’s recent suggestion that mr assad might be coaxed into accepting an offer of asylum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even if the seif plan gains traction “and that is far from guaranteed” says a western diplomat in doha the chasm between civilian and military leaders is still wide</s>
<s>rather than encouraging fighters to work with civilian committees many dissidents have grabbed onto the coattails of the fighters hoping to boost their own credentials</s>
<s>mr seif wants to work with rebel commanders but getting them to be represented on his new body will be tricky since the rebel groups are so fragmented and so numerous</s>
<s>in any event western diplomats fear that it may already be too late for the politicians to form a front that could control the fighters on the ground</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unifying the rebel factions would be easier if backers could agree which ones to supply</s>
<s>that is easier said than done</s>
<s>the washingtonbased syrian support group which channels every sort of aid to the armed opposition and works closely with the american government has struggled to persuade rebel militias to come under the command of provincial military councils</s>
<s>but as fast as units sign up rival councils sprout in the same province</s>
<s>“it is very hard to unite them because countries such as turkey and qatar have personal links to certain groups or fighters” says the support group’s louay sakka</s>
<s>“there is a lot of handpicking and favouritism”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the stronger groups such as the farouq battalion which emerged in homs and has now spread to the northern provinces of idleb and raqqa may absorb the smaller bands</s>
<s>farouq’s commanders in raqqa say they have already persuaded some smaller ones to join</s>
<s>but extreme islamist groups such as jabhat alnusra which has claimed responsibility for suicidebombings have also grown in size</s>
<s>“we don’t like them but it makes sense to work together” says abu saleh a farouq man explaining that the two groups have been discussing how to coordinate their attacks in raqqa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the past few months there has been something of a military stalemate with few big advances on either side despite the army’s indiscriminate use of heavy artillery and a death toll that has been over 1000 a week</s>
<s>but regime fatigue may be growing</s>
<s>the government’s supply lines to the vital battlefield of aleppo have been squeezed and some of the army’s best units are said to have been recalled to damascus the capital where rebels continue to press in from the suburbs despite aircraft and artillery pounding them ferociously</s>
<s>for the first time rebel bombs and mortars have hit districts of damascus that were hitherto considered safe for the regime</s>
