<s>it is among the hoariest of film clichés</s>
<s>the hero subdues one foe and turns his attention to another only to find that the first villain is still alive and bent on destruction</s>
<s>two years ago the rich world thought that the global recession was over vanquished by a wave of fiscal and monetary stimulus</s>
<s>policymakers turned their backs to clean up the government debt that had been left behind</s>
<s>in 2011 and 2012 structural deficits across the rich world will have been reduced by about 075 of gdp a pace that is forecast to rise in 2013</s>
<s>but economic gloom has not gone indeed fiscal consolidation seems to have deepened it</s>

<s>solvency worries drove the turn from stimulus to austerity</s>
<s>markets started losing their appetite for greek debt in late 2009</s>
<s>many governments feared they might be next</s>
<s>in october 2010 the imf called for belttightening and turned to gauging its probable impact</s>
<s>yet controversy surrounded this switch</s>
<s>the imf argued that austerity would be painful but necessary some academics reckoned that cuts could do more harm than good</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the debate centred on the value of an economic variable called a “multiplier”</s>
<s>a fiscal multiplier describes the change in gdp that is due to a change in taxandspending policy</s>
<s>a multiplier of 15 for instance means that $1 in governmentspending cuts reduces gdp by $150 a multiplier of 05 means a $1 cut in spending only reduces gdp by 50 cents</s>
<s>multipliers work both ways during the recession experts bickered over the extra economic bang to be expected from a given stimulus buck</s>
<s>but it is the impact of austerity that now preoccupies people</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a simple example illustrates the multiplier’s importance</s>
<s>take an economy growing at 15 a year and with a government budget deficit of 1 of gdp</s>
<s>if the multiplier is 2 spending cuts big enough to close the deficit produce a drop in gdp in the year the cuts take effect</s>
<s>for its pains the economy ends the year with a higher debttogdp ratio than it started with</s>
<s>a multiplier below 15 means slow growth and a lower debt burden at year’s end</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>estimates of fiscal multipliers are all over the map</s>
<s>some like alberto alesina and silvia ardagna of harvard university argue that fiscal consolidation may actually raise growth even in the short run</s>
<s>but the loose consensus a couple of years ago was that multipliers were typically around 1 or perhaps a bit below</s>
<s>in their 2010 analysis imf economists reckoned that governments cutting deficits by 1 of gdp could expect a shortrun hit to gdp growth of about half a percentage point a multiplier of about 05</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this view was predicated on the idea that other factors can offset the blow from budget cuts</s>
<s>spending cuts may “crowd in” privatesector activity if governments are using up scarce capital and labour then austerity creates room for private firms to expand</s>
<s>in open economies austerity’s bite can be passed on to other countries through reduced imports</s>
<s>most important of all monetary policy can act as a counterweight to fiscal policy</s>
<s>spending cuts that threaten to drag growth below a desired level should prompt monetary easing limiting the multiplier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what that means is that austerity may hurt much more at some times than others</s>
<s>in a 2010 paper alan auerbach and yuriy gorodnichenko of the university of california berkeley argued that the fiscal multiplier may be negative during booms meaning that spending cuts actually raise growth</s>
<s>in recessions by contrast it could be as high as 25</s>
<s>a study by lawrence christiano martin eichenbaum and sergio rebelo of northwestern university suggested that although the multiplier may hover at around 1 normally it could rise to more than 3 when interest rates fall to near zero leaving the central bank with less room to act</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the timing of postcrisis austerity could hardly have been less auspicious</s>
<s>first with many economies cutting budgets at once the impact of austerity on growth couldn’t easily be deflected elsewhere</s>
<s>that is a big problem in the euro zone where trade links are tight and countries are unable to devalue their currencies</s>
<s>second whereas cuts in government spending might normally be expected to free up resources for private use that mattered far less when unemployment and saving were high</s>
<s>third with borrowing costs already at rock bottom in safe havens like britain and america there was less room for them to fall further to offset the impact of austerity on demand</s>
<s>finally as many interest rates neared zero monetarypolicy action had less scope</s>

<p>
<s>to be fair the imf cautioned in 2010 that austerity might be more painful than normal for just these reasons</s>
<s>even so it underestimated the hit from budget cuts</s>
<s>in the fund’s latest “world economic outlook” released this month olivier blanchard its chief economist and daniel leigh study how well their past forecasts turned out</s>
<s>they analyse the imf’s 2010vintage forecasts for 28 rich economies and find that planned fiscal cuts of 1 of gdp generally led the imf to overestimate a country’s subsequent growth by about a percentage point</s>
<s>fiscal multipliers since the recession seem to have been between 09 and 17 they write rather than the 05 figure used in initial forecasts</s>
<s>that meant more economic hardship for less improvement in public finances</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given the small sample size these conclusions should also be treated cautiously</s>
<s>yet a battery of tests conducted by mr blanchard and mr leigh shows that the fund’s new results hold when controlling for things such as banking crises and remain statistically meaningful when countries on imf programmes such as greece and portugal are excluded</s>
<s>rapid belttightening may bring down deficits but it hurts growth more than the fund anticipated</s>
<s>the imf has seen this film before say critics of austerity it should have seen this coming</s>
