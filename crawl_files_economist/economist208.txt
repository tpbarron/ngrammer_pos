<s>a publicsector job is usually a cushy way to ride out a recession</s>
<s>not this time</s>
<s>austerity has bitten deeply into public payrolls as governments lay off workers slice wage bills or refuse to hire replacements for retirees</s>
<s>of 37 countries examined by the imf only four have increased spending on publicemployee labour costs since 2009 germany where the tally of workers has risen south africa turkey and argentina</s>
<s>what about the toll on the numbers of government workers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this question is harder to answer than it might seem</s>
<s>france has not published the number of public employees since the end of 2009 for example</s>
<s>publicsector workers sit in lots of different categories from civil servants to employees of utility companies</s>
<s>but the broad trend is clear see chart headcount is being slashed in many places</s>

<p>
<s>british publicsector employment has fallen by a thumping 74 since the peak in late 2009 excluding workers like teachers in privatised schools that have been recategorised</s>
<s>spain is fast catching up government payrolls there have fallen by 56 in the space of just nine months although they grew briskly in prior years</s>
<s>but the standout country is greece where government payrolls have shrunk by 163 since the peak in early 2009â€”comparable with the decline in greek privatesector employment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these numbers look puzzling given complaints from the greek private sector that the public sector has escaped the burden of austerity</s>
<s>it is true that greek government workers have avoided sackings true too that the state sector remains bloated</s>
<s>but the retrenchment in spending is still for real contract employees have not had their agreements renewed and some workers who were worried about future pension cuts took early retirement instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such tactics are common</s>
<s>the firing rate of government workers in america has not changed since 2001 for example even though municipal payrolls where the majority of the public sector is employed have fallen by 33 since 2008</s>
<s>the problem for greece which was still locked in negotiations with creditors this week is that doing more than others is never quite enough</s>
