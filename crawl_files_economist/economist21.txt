<s>solar panels get better and cheaper with every passing year</s>
<s>in one way though they are still quite primitive</s>
<s>they work only with light in the visible part of the spectrum</s>
<s>yet 40 of the solar energy that reaches the earth is in or very close to the infrared</s>
<s>a cell that could harvest such radiation would be a boon to the solarpower business but building one has proved difficult</s>
<s>now though as they report in advanced materials a group of researchers led by michael strano at the massachusetts institute of technology have worked out how to do it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when sunlight strikes the silicon atoms in an ordinary solar cell it knocks electrons loose and allows them to flow as an electrical current</s>
<s>light of other frequencies can do the same trick with other materials</s>
<s>researchers have known for several years for example that carbon nanotubes—tiny cylinders whose walls are sheets of carbon—will release electrons when stimulated by infrared light</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that discovery led to much experimentation but little progress</s>
<s>the chief difficulty lies in the process used to make the tubes</s>
<s>this actually produces a mixture of two different sorts ones that have metallike properties and ones that are semiconducting</s>
<s>solar cells need the semiconducting variety</s>
<s>metallic ones poison the process and must be removed before a cell can work properly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>until now researchers wishing to do that have been forced to play a tedious game of pickupsticks selecting the semiconducting nanotubes one by one and then sticking them in place with glue</s>
<s>it is possible to make a solar cell this way but it is timeconsuming and expensive</s>
<s>worse the chemical instability of the glue means such cells tend to break down rapidly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr strano however has exploited a new manufacturing process based on a polymer gel that has an affinity for semiconducting nanotubes but not metallic ones</s>
<s>he is thus able to extract large numbers of semiconducting tubes from a mixture</s>
<s>that done he deposits them in a 100 nanometrethick layer on top of a piece of glass to which they stick without the need for glue</s>
<s>the whole thing is then topped with a layer of buckminsterfullerene a form of carbon in which the atoms are arranged in tiny cagelike spheres</s>
<s>this layer acts as an electrode so that the solar panel can be connected to a circuit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the result is not exactly efficient</s>
<s>it transforms only around 01 of the infrared light thrown at it into electricity compared with 20 for an ordinary solar cell</s>
<s>but dr strano and his colleagues are nonetheless jubilant</s>
<s>after all 01 is a big step up from nothing at all and most existing solar technologies began with similarly poor efficiencies that were improved gradually over the course of time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover the new technology has one big benefit</s>
<s>though the carbon nanotubes absorb infrared light they are almost totally transparent to the visible variety</s>
<s>this means that if and when they become commercially viable they can be overlaid on traditional silicon cells to produce a device that converts a larger fraction of the incident sunlight into electricity</s>
