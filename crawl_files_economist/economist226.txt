<s>they don’t look like much</s>
<s>but the tins displayed in the boardroom of thai union frozen tuf in bangkok have propelled this littleknown company into the league of global multinationals</s>
<s>as befits thailand’s biggest cannedseafood producer there are plenty of its local tuna and sardines on show</s>
<s>but pride of place goes to tuf’s foreign acquisitions tins of john west britain’s leading brand of tuna of petit navire and parmentier france’s top tuna and sardine brands respectively and of chicken of the sea the largest cannedtuna brand in america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this collection represents about a fifth of the world’s output of canned tuna</s>
<s>but since there is little to identify tuf as the owner of the brands foreign fishmunchers have probably never heard of the thai parent company despite sales of over $3 billion a year</s>
<s>foreigners may also be blithely unaware of the global advances of thailand’s other big companies</s>

<s>in july the stateowned oilandgas company ptt caused by stir by outbidding royal dutch shell for a company with rights in a large gasfield off mozambique paying $19 billion for britain’s cove energy</s>
<s>and last month thaibev a foodanddrink conglomerate did battle against heineken a dutch brewer for a share in asia pacific breweries the maker of tiger beer</s>
<s>heineken won—but only after buying off thaibev handsomely</s>

<s>in 2011 boston consulting group bcg included four thai companies in its list of the top 100 multinationals from emerging economies—two fewer than from russia and twice as many as from indonesia which has over three times thailand’s population</s>

<s>thaksin shinawatra a former prime minister once tried to brand his country the “kitchen of the world”</s>
<s>like a good wok that didn’t stick</s>
<s>but agribusiness and foodprocessing companies have been leading thailand’s charge abroad</s>
<s>the charoen pokphand cp group one of the world’s largest poultry producers has operations in 17 countries and owns the thirdlargest 7eleven chain in the world</s>
<s>along with tuf it is joined on the bcg list by ptt an oil firm and a more unlikely candidate indorama ventures the largest global producer of polyethylene terephthalate an essential ingredient in plastic bottles</s>

<s>why have these thai companies started to expand abroad</s>
<s>they are cashrich partly because they are well run and partly thanks to caution</s>
<s>pavida pananond an expert on thai business at bangkok’s thammasat university thinks thai firms were so seared by the asian financial crisis of 1997 that they have “become very prudent and conservative”</s>
<s>only now are they moving abroad—cautiously—having outgrown their small domestic market</s>

<p>
<s>but that is not the whole story argues thiraphong chansiri tuf’s boss</s>
<s>tuf works hard to keep the chicken of the sea cheap using big fishing fleets and operating warehouses in lowcost countries such as ghana and the seychelles</s>
<s>“our competitive advantage is on the supply chain as lowcost suppliers” he says</s>
<s>“and we apply that to the big brands”</s>
