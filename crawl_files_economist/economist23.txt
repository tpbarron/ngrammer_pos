<s>stuff happens as donald rumsfeld once remarked but he was only partly right sometimes stuff does not happen</s>
<s>dont be too dismissive of that</s>
<s>many nonevents are significant</s>
<s>in the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime for example the fact that was important to sherlock holmes was that the hound did not bark</s>
<s>so in principle to continue in a rumsfeldian vein foreknowledge of things that are not going to take place may be as useful as foreknowledge of things that are going to take place</s>
<s>and though some nonevents must inevitably remain unknown others are known and the coming year will have plenty of them</s>

<s>several will derive from one of the big known events of 2012 the american presidential election</s>
<s>that this will take place as mandated by congress in 1845 on the first tuesday after the first monday in november of every year divisible by four is not in doubt and that in itself is remarkable since no equivalent certainty attaches to political occurrences in other countries</s>
<s>however it brings nonevents with it</s>
<s>like other presidents running for reelection before him barack obama will not be launching any controversial policies in 2012</s>
<s>anyone hoping for such initiatives—a middle east peace plan that might offend jewish voters a lifting of the embargo on cuba or the recognition of the castro regime the abolition of subsidies to american cotton growers or sugar producers behaviouraltering policies to combat climate change stricter federal gun laws or looser drug laws—should resign themselves to disappointment</s>
<s>a happier prospect is the knowledge that the united states will not be starting any discretionary wars like the one in iraq</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there will be nonevents elsewhere too</s>
<s>the legislatures in a few american states normally meet only in oddnumbered years</s>
<s>that means the people of montana nevada north dakota and texas will have no new laws or budgets to contend with</s>
<s>a surprise parliamentary poll may be sprung in almost any democracy but there will be none in norway or switzerland where a dissolution is all but impossible</s>
<s>citizens of the european union will also be spared any elections to its parliament they take place according to a strict fiveyearly cycle</s>

<s>no conscription will take place in germany the armed services will now be composed of volunteers only</s>
<s>no bullfights will be held in the great plaza de toros monumental in barcelona catalonia has banned them</s>
<s>no man booker international prize will be awarded odd years only</s>
<s>and no women over 40 will be entertaining audiences at the tauranga tarnished frocks and divas show in new zealand wait for 2013</s>

<s>petrolheads will also have to wait for the frankfurt motor show they can ogle commercial vehicles in hanover as a consolation</s>
<s>aviation fans will have to forgo the paris air show go back to le bourget in 2013</s>
<s>artlovers will journey in vain to venice for the biennale its biennial</s>
<s>and ravers will be deprived of the glastonbury music festival all the portable loos are needed for the olympics in london</s>

<s>not the end of the world</s>

<s>if perhaps improbably you happen to be a female wandering albatross crowned eagle black bear or pignosed turtle all of which reproduce only every other year you may be in luck and have the breeding season off</s>
<s>and if youre a northern female slimy salamander with no such luck you may want to head south where your counterparts make egglaying a twoyearly ordeal</s>

<p>
<s>one nonevent is certain</s>
<s>some pseudoscholars who misread the evidence believe that december 21st 2012 the last day of a 5125year run of the mayan longcount calendar will mark the end of the world</s>
<s>this publication has poetically indulged them in its obituary page</s>
<s>but they are mistaken—as are the religious maniacs who foresee armageddon in the coming months</s>
<s>so confident is the world in 2012 that this is a nonevent that we will refund your money if we are proved wrong</s>
