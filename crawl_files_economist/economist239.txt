<s>is spain imitating japan</s>
<s>as recently as 2007 bubbly spain was a vigorous creator of growth and jobs</s>
<s>it even invested in japanesestyle bullet trains rolling out a rail network admired around the globe</s>
<s>those days are over witness 20 unemployment</s>
<s>in 2010 as other european economies grew again spains shrank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so when will it return to meaningful growth</s>
<s>not in 2011 when gdp will expand by less than 1</s>
<s>at the end of its construction bubble spain hit the buffers</s>
<s>like japan since the mid1990s it will now mark time</s>
<s>the worlds ninthbiggest economy in 2009 will soon be twelfth overtaken by russia india and canada</s>
<s>recent reforms are a change in the right direction but not enough to stop spain from falling behind</s>

<p>
<s>the socialist prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero is a reluctant reformer</s>
<s>having refused to admit that spains problems were as much selfinflicted as a result of the global credit crunch he was slow to recognise market impatience with spains deficit—until the threat of a eurozone sovereigndebt crisis in 2010 forced his hand</s>
<s>as a result fiscal austerity and labour reform will get their first fullyear trials in 2011 the deficit will fall from 10 to 7</s>
<s>a timid pension reform will also finally go through parliament</s>
<s>but the slump in residential construction will take time to fix</s>
<s>banks hold up to 200000 newly built homes as part of €60 billionworth $84 billion of real estate taken in debtforasset swaps with struggling developers</s>
<s>many of those will be dumped on the market in 2011 further depressing prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the poll ratings of the socialists held up well until austerity measures were announced—when they plunged</s>
<s>the political story of 2011 will be the minority governments attempts to head off electoral humiliation when spaniards go to the polls in the first half of 2012</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as mr zapatero runs out of allies on the left he will increasingly depend on nationalist deputies from the basque country and catalonia</s>
<s>they will demand a price</s>
<s>with no money to give mr zapatero must pay with parcels of power</s>
<s>there will be still more devolution in one of europes most decentralised countries</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the basque country meanwhile the separatist group eta stopped killing people for much of 2010</s>
<s>if mr zapatero can get eta to move to a permanent end of violence then he may gain some more voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>looking for señor fixit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>polls show that mr zapatero is increasingly a liability to the socialists</s>
<s>a spectacular way to change his partys fortunes may be to announce that he will not lead it into the 2012 elections</s>
<s>with the leader of the opposition peoples party mariano rajoy also doing badly in his personal poll ratings a party that presents a fresh face to voters could reap their gratitude</s>
