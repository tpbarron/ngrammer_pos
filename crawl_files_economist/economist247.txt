<s>push a japanese standup doll over and it bounces back up</s>
<s>it is a symbol of optimism the japanese government included three okiagarikoboshi dolls in the welcome pack for the imfworld bank meetings this week in toyko</s>
<s>the opening message from the imf was much less positive</s>
<s>a rebound in the global economy is looking less and less likely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first bit of gloom came when the imf unveiled its new set of global forecasts</s>
<s>the world economy is weakening and it is not just a euroarea problem</s>
<s>emergingmarket growth is slowing too the fund’s 2012 growth estimates for india and brazil were slashed by one percentage point or more</s>
<s>both brazil and south korea cut interest rates this week</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even so emerging markets get a good bill of health overall</s>
<s>growth rates are still higher than in advanced economies</s>
<s>and policy looks supportive thanks to low interest rates and a gradual process of deficit reduction</s>
<s>things look much gloomier in the rich world</s>
<s>growth is more anaemic</s>
<s>to make things worse policymakers are responding badly particularly when it comes to fiscal matters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some prescriptions are obvious</s>
<s>the fund urges america and japan the largest and thirdlargest economies in the world to end their budgetary politicking</s>
<s>but even if america’s “fiscal cliff” is avoided and japan’s budget deadlock broken the imf is also rethinking what constitutes good fiscal policy over the longer term</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to olivier blanchard the fund’s top economist the impact of fiscal consolidation is “large negative and significant”</s>
<s>the size of this effect is bigger than the fund previously thought</s>
<s>“fiscal multipliers”—the change in gdp growth that results from a change in the government’s structural budget deficit—were thought until recently to be 05</s>
<s>new imf research now suggests a multiplier effect of 0917 is more likely</s>
<s>so deficit reduction of one percentage point could knock up to 17 percentage points off growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is bad news for countries such as britain france and the netherlands which plan to frontload their consolidation efforts</s>
<s>rapid deficit reduction in these countries means that hits to output are now expected to be bigger than before and are going to materialise in a weakerthananticipated global economic environment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the chink of light is that—unlike peripheral eurozone members—these countries have room to manoeuvre</s>
<s>borrowing costs remain historically low for most g7 countries overall interest payments are lower than in 2008 even in countries where debt is higher</s>
<s>that suggests many could buy some time reducing deficits more gradually so as to spread out the hit to growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fund has thoughts on the substance of fiscal policy as well as its timing</s>
<s>shifting the balance towards increasing tax revenue rather than cutting spending would mean consolidation is less likely to increase inequality</s>
<s>governments could use their spending power more cleverly too</s>
<s>evidence suggests that generous unemployment benefits tend to increase joblessness</s>
<s>a better approach would be to fund jobsearch programmes and switch towards inwork benefits including subsidised child care</s>
<s>“slower fairer smarter” might be one way of summing it all up</s>
