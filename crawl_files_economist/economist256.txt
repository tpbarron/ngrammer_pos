<s>rarely can a single statistic have been grasped so desperately</s>
<s>an estimate published on october 25th showed that gdp rose by 1 an annualised rate of 4 in the three months to the end of september</s>
<s>a day earlier david cameron the prime minister had told mps that “the good news will keep coming” on the economy</s>
<s>mr cameron had seen an advance release of figures and his comment seemed to break the embargo on official statistics</s>
<s>if so he also broke an informal political rule call a turning point in case it proves to be a false one</s>

<p>
<s>so fitful has britain’s economy been that any good news is understandably snatched at</s>
<s>the rise in gdp came after three quarters of declining output but the latest figures exaggerate the economy’s strength just as earlier figures had made it look unduly weak</s>
<s>most of the fall in output in the second quarter probably owed to the loss of a working day because of the queen’s diamond jubilee</s>
<s>the return to normal working in july may have added up to 05 percentage points to gdp growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there was an additional boost to output from the olympic games</s>
<s>the statistics office said ticket sales added around 02 percentage points to gdp</s>
<s>there was also some evidence that hotels and arts venues though not retailing benefited from the london games</s>
<s>strip out these temporary influences and the economy’s growth rate looks rather modest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still other figures point to a stirring economy</s>
<s>retail sales rose by 1 in the three months to the end of september the strongest quarterly increase for more than two years</s>
<s>new car registrations were 82 higher in september than a year earlier</s>
<s>the unemployment rate has dropped below 8</s>
<s>even the public finances look a bit less sickly</s>
<s>a pickup in revenue from nationalinsurance contributions and vat in september seems to add weight to the more positive signs from the jobs market and the high street</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is a feature of hard economic times that any good news must be qualified</s>
<s>britain’s consumers have perked up in part because falling inflation is taking a smaller bite out of incomes</s>
<s>but inflation is set to rise again in coming months as domestic gas bills increase</s>
<s>recent business surveys have had a downbeat tone</s>
<s>and the fragility of the euro zone remains a threat</s>
<s>a closely watched index of activity in the currency zone fell in october to its lowest level in three years</s>
<s>such figures are a reminder that recovery might easily be knocked off course</s>
