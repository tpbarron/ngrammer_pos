<s>the 21m residents of mexico city have far too much rubbish and not enough healthy food</s>
<s>now they can swap one for the other</s>
<s>a new monthly market run by the city government takes paper glass plastic and aluminium in return for tokens that can be swapped for locally grown food and plants</s>
<s>since it began in march the “barter market” in chapultepec park has exchanged 140 tonnes of rubbish for 60 tonnes of produce</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the market is a small step towards tackling a big waste problem</s>
<s>in january piles of rubbish built up after a landfill closed</s>
<s>it had received up to 12600 tonnes of trash a day and was the size of 450 football pitches</s>
<s>the muckup will not be the last unless households get better at recycling</s>
<s>“we want people to learn that rubbish is not rubbish” says paola de maría y campos a city official who helped set up the market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the project provides welcome jobs for the city’s farmers many of whom work in the watery southern district of xochimilco</s>
<s>canals there are the last reminder of what mexico city looked like before the spanish drained the lake on which it sat</s>
<s>the city’s undeveloped south is prone to illegal slumbuilding</s>
<s>the government hopes to deter this by promoting farming on the land</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the market is proving popular</s>
<s>queues start to form at 6am and food nearly sells out by noon</s>
<s>“now everyone in our family is separating their waste” says eugenia trueba showing off a bag of lettuce sesame seeds and cactus leaves which she got for newspapers and plastic bottles</s>
<s>however over half of visitors come by car somewhat undermining the market’s green credentials</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the project does not break even</s>
<s>each month the market sells 20 or so tonnes of rubbish to glassmakers paper manufacturers and other firms for about 40000 pesos $3100</s>
<s>the food which the government buys from xochimilco’s farmers at abovemarket prices costs 90000 pesos</s>
<s>taxpayers pick up the difference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the point however is to get people recycling not to make money</s>
<s>plans for new branches are under way and the market may go fortnightly</s>
<s>the real test will be whether more households can be persuaded to recycle even without the carrot of free food in return</s>
