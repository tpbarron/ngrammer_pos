<s>the successful uprisings of 2011 in north africa were closely watched farther south on the continent</s>
<s>they have already spawned some local protest movements—as in burkina faso—and are inspiring talk of more</s>
<s>authoritarian rulers in subsaharan africa can expect a year of growing opposition and attempts to dethrone them</s>
<s>the dynamics are likely to be somewhat different from those on the mediterranean shore where protesters were richer and better informed</s>
<s>the protest bug is catching nonetheless</s>
<s>in places like uganda the downtrodden are hailing the liberators of tunis tripoli and cairo as role models creating crossafrican political connections rarely seen in recent decades</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as in north africa mobile communication and social media are popular on the rest of the continent and not just in rich enclaves</s>
<s>more than 1m nigerians have a blackberry</s>
<s>africa as a whole has more mobile phones than america</s>
<s>this means that traditional impediments to political organisation for opposition groups are weakening</s>
<s>and there is no shortage of things to protest about</s>
<s>jobs are rare and food prices are rising</s>
<s>the cost of staples has grown by multiples thanks to high demand and a rise in the cost of fuel needed to produce and transport them</s>
<s>africans have been beneficiaries of the resource boom too earning fees from oil and minerals</s>
<s>but the benefits go primarily to the powerful</s>

<s>ripe for rebellion</s>

<p>
<s>angola and equatorial guinea are prime examples</s>
<s>both are ruled by resourcepeddling strongmen—each in power for 32 years making them africas longestserving leaders since the ousting and killing of muammar qaddafi in libya after 41 years</s>
<s>they are the second and fourthbiggest oil producers in subsaharan africa</s>
<s>yet most people there live on less than $1 a day</s>
<s>what has held back the masses from rising up so far is the memory of past turmoil</s>
<s>both countries lost large parts of the population to political violence in recent decades</s>
<s>but the examples of successful north african uprisings seen on satellite television are changing the dynamic</s>
<s>protests if so far rare have shaken the capitals of both countries and are likely to recur in 2012</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the distribution of resource wealth is also once again fuelling conflict in the democratic republic of congo</s>
<s>the tightening of americas trade rules has resulted in a virtual standstill in mining in the volatile eastern part of the country until recently the source of rare metals used by american manufacturers</s>
<s>some unemployed local miners talk of joining militias to earn a living even if that might undermine efforts to get over a conflict that has killed 5m people in the past 15 years</s>
<s>the economy has collapsed</s>
<s>unless action is taken to put it together again bloodshed is likely though not a resumption of actual war</s>
<s>television pictures from north africa have reminded many that there are alternatives to accepting ones fate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the most obvious impact of the north african uprising will be felt in the neighbouring sahel states</s>
<s>niger chad and mali had close links with colonel qaddafi and on occasion benefited from his largesse</s>
<s>his successors are likely to invest in libya rather than abroad</s>
<s>furthermore the departure of tens of thousands of migrant sahel workers from libya means an end of the remittances they send home</s>
<s>local mercenaries once in the colonels pay will also trickle back</s>
<s>all this sets the scene for the rise of protest movements</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the sahel states two biggest neighbours nigeria and sudan already have them—the armed kind</s>
<s>in nigeria an islamic extremist group boko haram has stepped up its campaign of violence</s>
<s>in sudan several militias are stranded on the wrong side of the northsouth border following the division of the country in july 2011 and are fighting miniinsurgencies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this has little to do with the uprisings in north africa except that they gave supposed legitimacy to anyone defying political elites</s>
<s>that also applies to countries facing elections in 2012</s>
<s>latent conflicts in africa frequently flare up at such times</s>
<s>zimbabwe and kenya suffered horrendous violence during past polls</s>
<s>both are due to have new ones in the next 12 months and opposition movements feel buoyed by the success of arab rebels to the north</s>
<s>kenya may avoid a repeat of the 2008 bloodletting but not zimbabwe where robert mugabes regime is fighting for its life and wealth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although africa faces a protestladen year this does not signal a return to the largescale conflicts of the past</s>
<s>civil wars in sudan and angola have most likely ended for good</s>
<s>the general atmosphere in subsaharan africa is almost as hopeful as farther north</s>
<s>overall gdp growth is strong thanks to the resource boom and improved economic management</s>
<s>political protests will not change that</s>
<s>but foreign investors—now queuing up at african airports in ever larger numbers—will want to choose their destinations carefully</s>
<s>nine african leaders have been in power for more than two decades see map</s>
<s>some of them could quickly turn from dependable if bloodstained partners to hasbeens</s>
<s>by comparison african democracies with regular and orderly changes in leadership such as ghana and south africa will look even more attractive in 2012</s>
