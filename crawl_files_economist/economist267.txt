<s>in conventional manufacturing economies of scale matter</s>
<s>with 3d printing it costs no more per unit to make one item than to make thousands so refining a product is much less costly than it used to be as designers see where improvements can be made or receive feedback from customers they can tweak the products as they go along</s>
