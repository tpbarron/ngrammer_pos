<s>at first sight palanpur is a powerful reminder of the stubborn persistence of india’s rural poverty</s>
<s>the village is not particularly remote</s>
<s>it is next to a railway line only a few miles from a big highway and less than 120 miles from delhi</s>
<s>it is surrounded by some of india’s most fertile agricultural land well suited to the cultivation of sugar cane groundnuts and menthol</s>
<s>yet palanpur’s residents are crowded into sparse dwellings along mud paths with no running water no drains and only intermittent electricity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spend a day in the village and the picture becomes more nuanced</s>
<s>you hear how life has improved</s>
<s>even the poorest villagers now have brick rather than mud houses only a couple of years ago many were still made of mud</s>
<s>from marblepolishing to brickmaking more jobs outside agriculture are becoming available</s>
<s>the government’s rural employmentguarantee scheme has put a floor under wages</s>
<s>the roads have got better</s>
<s>all children now attend the village school when only a few years ago many children from the lowest castes were not in school</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are obvious gaps between wealthier and poorer folk</s>
<s>mahendra morya head of the richest family in the village recently bought a second tractor</s>
<s>some households now have pit latrines</s>
<s>a couple even have a television on which to watch dvds</s>
<s>many of the most visibly wealthy are members of the upper castes</s>
<s>mr morya is a murao a high caste of cultivators</s>
<s>but some further down the social pecking order seem to be doing well too</s>
<s>nanhe the head of a muslim family started out repairing bicycles in the 1990s</s>
<s>now he has a mentholprocessing facility and plans to branch out into mustard oil</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most surprising is the success of ramjimal a jatab the group at the bottom of palanpur society</s>
<s>he is a skilled bricklayer travelling around neighbouring villages building houses</s>
<s>one of his brothers has become a lawyer and moved to chandausi the nearest town</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a longrunning study at the london school of economics provides statistics to confirm these impressions</s>
<s>its researchers have spent over 50 years conducting detailed surveys to track the fortunes of palanpur’s residents</s>
<s>the most recent one in 200809 shows considerable change from the previous one in 1983</s>
<s>real incomes have doubled which over 25 years translates into modest average annual growth of just under 3 and income disparities have become much wider</s>
<s>palanpur’s gini coefficient in 2009 was 04 30 higher than in 1983</s>
<s>but social mobility has increased too and a disproportionately large number of the winners came from the bottom of the social heap</s>
<s>half of the families that climbed most were jatabs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a study by viktoria hnatkovska and colleagues of the university of british columbia suggests that palanpur is not an isolated case</s>
<s>it shows that the intergenerational mobility of india’s dalits or scheduled castes the most disadvantaged group has improved and is now similar to that of other groups</s>
<s>ms hnatkovska’s findings remain controversial but most indian academics agree that caste rigidities are loosening mainly thanks to the growth of nonagricultural employment and improved access to basic education</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is still a long way to go</s>
<s>secondaryschool attendance among the scheduled castes generally remains shockingly low</s>
<s>and with income gaps widening there is a danger that those at the bottom will get stuck there</s>
<s>but in a country where for centuries the disadvantaged had no chance of improving their prospects more social mobility even amid wider inequality is a big step forward</s>
