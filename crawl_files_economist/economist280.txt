<s>opentable was born of frustration</s>
<s>why asked chuck templeton its founder can i book a seat on an aeroplane online but not in a restaurant</s>
<s>so mr templeton set out to build an online service of his own starting in san francisco</s>
<s>in a fragmented industry of small family businesses that meant signing up restaurants one by one</s>
<s>what made it harder still was that the year was 1998 when many restaurants did not even have internet connections</s>
<s>so opentable not only had to persuade restaurateurs to take its software it often had to supply hardware too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fourteen years on opentable has spread across north america and to germany japan and britain</s>
<s>restaurants pay a subscription of $199 a month plus $1 for seats filled through opentable’s website and 25 cents for those booked through the restaurant’s own</s>
<s>in the first half of this year the firm’s revenue was $79m well over twice as much as three years earlier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as opentable’s story shows local services have been provided over the internet for many years</s>
<s>craigslist an online classifiedadvertising site has been going since 1999</s>
<s>but the spread of the smartphone has made a huge difference it is a powerful portable computer that allows its user’s position to be tracked to within a few yards so that he can be told all sorts of information about what is around him</s>
<s>especially in america and particularly in its big cities this has sparked a proliferation of “locationbased services”—an ugly mouthful meaning roughly services arranged or provided online according to where the user is</s>
<s>they can be anything from driving directions to discounts at local shops or restaurant reservations</s>
<s>matt roberts opentable’s chief executive says that 28 of his bookings are made from mobile devices</s>
<s>he expects that eventually most will be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“the catalyst was clearly the iphone” says jeremy stoppelman founder and chief executive of yelp which lists and reviews local businesses</s>
<s>“easy access to a user’s location passively where they just have to open their phone and it tells you where they are that’s really what’s led to everything” yelp has been around since 2004 three years before the iphone appeared but mr stoppelman says he had always thought yelp’s content would be useful on the go</s>
<s>of the 78m people who look at yelp on the web 25 come from its mobile website</s>
<s>the 72m who used its mobile apps at least monthly in the first half of this year account for 40 of searches</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as easy as one two three</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>locationbased services take three main forms</s>
<s>the first matches unmet demand with unused supply with the middleman taking a cut</s>
<s>opentable which tells diners where and when there is space and helps restaurants fill tables is one example</s>
<s>“daily deals” sites such as groupon and livingsocial which sell special offers from local businesses are another</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>services of this type are coming to the streets too</s>
<s>uber from san francisco has been running taxis in boston chicago and toronto as well as limousine services in several cities</s>
<s>hailo a startup based in london whose founders include three drivers of the city’s black cabs has taken its taxi app to dublin and competes with uber in boston and toronto</s>
<s>both services work through smartphone apps that show users the nearest available cars and an estimate of how long one will take to arrive</s>
<s>a tap on the smartphone hails the cab</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both would also like to help new yorkers pinpoint yellow taxis</s>
<s>although the streets are chockablock with them finding one that will take you where you want to go can be a hairtearing experience especially just before a change of shift</s>
<s>uber was first out of the garage in new york in early september</s>
<s>but by midoctober it was back in</s>
<s>travis kalanick the company’s chief executive says demand was brisk but blames the city’s taxi regulator for a shortage of cabs 160 drivers took part</s>
<s>the regulator has said that for now taxi drivers may not accept debit or creditcard payments through smartphones but must use the system already installed in their cabs</s>
<s>nor may they use a smartphone on the move</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>uber’s limos are still running and it hopes to try again with taxis next year</s>
<s>hailo still expects to start a service when new rules are in place</s>
<s>it says 4000 drivers have “preregistered” for its app</s>
<s>ricardo merisme a haitianborn cabbie who has signed up thinks it is a great idea for customers especially at weekends</s>
<s>“on the weekend sometimes it is slow</s>
<s>we don’t have a lot of taxis especially early morning</s>
<s>if you can just call a taxi to come and get you you would not stand outside to look for one” there are benefits for drivers too</s>
<s>jay bregman hailo’s chief executive reckons that london cabbies spend up to half of their shifts looking for fares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a variation on the theme of matching supply and demand is “collaborative consumption” or the “sharing economy”</s>
<s>again idle assets are married to unmet wants and the matchmaker takes a slice of the resulting deal</s>
<s>the difference is that unlike restaurant tables or seats in taxis the assets in question are usually private property</s>
<s>but for the collaborativeconsumption services they would probably not be on the market at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the point is to share unused resources that already exist and would otherwise in effect go to waste</s>
<s>this is the idea underlying ridesharing services such as zimride blablacar a french company and carpoolingcom a german one that connect drivers and passengers who want to make the same intercity journeys</s>
<s>perhaps the bestknown example of collaborative consumption is airbnb through which people rent out spare rooms flats or houses to travellers looking for somewhere to stay</s>
<s>most people book before they travel but within airbnb’s smartphone app you can also look for a bed once you have arrived via a button marked “help</s>
<s>i need a place tonight”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second sort is the locationbased social network</s>
<s>this may keep you in touch with your friends on foursquare users “check in” at cafés bars and other places to let their pals know about their movements perhaps with a view to meeting</s>
<s>or it may introduce you to strangers whom you might like to meet—such as badoo which says it has “hundreds of thousands of new guys and girls joining daily” highlight and banjo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another idea is to make it easier to meet your neighbours</s>
<s>local groups can and do already create pages on facebook but nirav tolia the founder of nextdoor has quietly set up more than 5000 neighbourhood networks in 48 american states in just over a year</s>
<s>“your neighbours are not your friends” he says but you do have a range of interests in common from crime rates to local schools to good plumbers or you might just want to borrow a lawnmower</s>
<s>“the internet has been about building virtual communities” mr tolia adds</s>
<s>“it’s now about strengthening existing physical communities”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the third form of locationbased service is local information search and listings</s>
<s>yelp has been elbowing aside the yellow pages providing not only phone numbers and addresses but also links to websites as well as online maps and reviews by customers</s>
<s>mostly this is financed by advertising about 70 of yelp’s revenues come from ads by local businesses listed on its site</s>
<s>trulia and zillow allow househunters to search for properties online</s>
<s>on zillow you can use your finger to draw around your preferred area on a touchscreen on trulia you can compare crime rates in different places</s>
<s>both make their money from selling services to subscribing estate agents</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some companies now span several of these categories</s>
<s>for instance foursquare is evolving into a local search engine using the data it has amassed from members’ checkins and recommendations</s>
<s>based on where you have been in the past and what you and your friends like it suggests places and makes offers such as a discount on a cup of coffee</s>
<s>since the middle of this month people have also been able to search its website without logging in or signing up for a foursquare account</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the strength of all these services depends largely on their ability to build networks of suppliers and users</s>
<s>the more people join the more are attracted in</s>
<s>the act of signing up ties suppliers into the network</s>
<s>once a restaurant has joined opentable or a homeowner has subscribed to airbnb there is little point in going to a rival service and running the risk of doublebooking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many locationbased services work best in big cities where there are lots of places to eat and lots of car seats going spare within a few square miles</s>
<s>they tend to start in one city and spread out</s>
<s>for many services san francisco has been the starting point</s>
<s>it is big enough to be an urban testing ground and full of techies who can write the software to make the services work</s>
<s>it also has plenty of people who are willing to try them san franciscans seem to eat out more than most</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>feedback loops</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such services generate a lot of useful data which can strengthen a network further</s>
<s>cabbies using hailo get a record of their day’s trips and fares from which they can see when and where they are making money</s>
<s>restaurateurs using opentable can learn who the regular diners are and perhaps make them especially welcome when they walk through the door</s>
<s>reputation can be particularly important in collaborative consumption where the suppliers are individuals rather than businesspeople and therefore have no brand</s>
<s>ratings and reviews are one method though people sometimes pay for puffery</s>
<s>with airbnb travellers can choose to stay with facebook friends friends of friends or hosts recommended by friends</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not everyone is glad to see new services arrive</s>
<s>local regulations and politics can get in the way especially in the taxi business where uber in particular is seen as a disruptive force</s>
<s>“every city is different” says mr kalanick</s>
<s>new york is not the only place where it has found a spoke in its wheels</s>
<s>in washington dc local taxi drivers lobbied against competition from uber’s limos</s>
<s>the city council proposed a minimum charge for uber that was five times the price of a taxi but relented after the company organised a brisk socialmedia campaign</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regulators are not the only obstacle to moving into new territory</s>
<s>a rival may already have established itself there</s>
<s>blablacar has spread from france into britain spain and italy but in germany carpoolingcom is strongly entrenched and has designs on zimride’s patch america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one way of getting into new markets is to buy your way in</s>
<s>in britain airbnb bought crashpadder a similar venture and opentable digested toptable a reservation and review site for smart restaurants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the global giants of the internet notably facebook and google want to go much more local too</s>
<s>about 7m small businesses have regularly maintained facebook pages which may be their only online presence</s>
<s>facebook’s selling point is that its advertising platform makes it remarkably easy to go further in reaching potential customers and aim ads at finely targeted audiences selected from the network’s membership of 1 billion</s>
<s>advertisers can narrow down their target audience by age gender and tastes expressed through facebook’s “likes” as well as by area</s>
<s>a price pops up and a “sponsored story” can be planted</s>
<s>if people choose to like the ad or the company then stories appear in their friends’ “news feeds”</s>
<s>facebook has also introduced foursquarestyle checkins and has bought glancee another app to help you discover interesting people nearby</s>
<s>it is also said to be considering restaurant reviews</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>google’s selfdescribed mission is to catalogue all the world’s information and to make it searchable online</s>
<s>naturally that includes local businesses from restaurants to ironmongers and what their users think of them</s>
<s>but to be comprehensive it needs content not least more reviews although its search results bring up reviews from other sources</s>
<s>to help fill that gap it recently bought frommer’s a travelguide business and zagat a restaurantreview company</s>
<s>still it has other things in its favour a powerful search engine the brains of 33000 googlers and the determination to map the world in the most intricate detail</s>
