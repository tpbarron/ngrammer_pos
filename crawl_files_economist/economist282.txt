<s>greg smith is one of life’s smaller big winners</s>
<s>his ticket out of johannesburg came from winning a scholarship to stanford university insight into a computerised application system opened the way to an internship at goldman sachs and an understanding of its darwinian hiring system led to a job luxurious perks and high pay</s>
<s>his 12year career ended with a scathing denunciation of the bank on the editorial page of the new york times and the publication this week of a book whose title “why i left goldman sachs” could spark an entire genre by disaffected drones in successful organisations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a whispering campaign of sorts has undermined mr smith suggesting he never really was up to goldman’s standards</s>
<s>this is probably true although a similar criticism could be made of everyone who ever worked there</s>
<s>and to mr smith’s credit he left on his own terms no small feat</s>
<s>of the 75 college graduates recruited from his year only 7 were still at the firm when he departed for the last time</s>
<s>no doubt others left voluntarily but one theme that keeps popping up is that goldman is a difficult place to join and a difficult place to stay</s>
<s>critics have panned the book for being short on killer details but it provides a rare inside look into a career path to which many aspire from nothing to wall street affluence</s>

<p>
<s>it will also be read because of its characterisation of goldman’s integrity</s>
<s>where once it profited from helping clients prosper the bank shifted mr smith contends into an entity that profited from clients</s>
<s>this sentiment was particularly evident mr smith says in the firm’s london office where greed and selfinterest ran riot and clients were derisively referred to as “muppets” suggesting a childlike naivety that could be exploited</s>
<s>mr smith is stunned by a colleague who says it is easier to recover a lost reputation than lost principal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>goldman denies this portrait</s>
<s>it reportedly scanned internal emails to see how often muppets were mentioned</s>
<s>nearly all referred to last year’s film about kermit and miss piggy</s>
<s>but the old business model of merely being an intermediary acting on behalf of clients does seem to have run its course</s>
<s>for mr smith that is to goldman’s discredit</s>
<s>but his book implicitly raises another question why clients don’t wise up</s>
