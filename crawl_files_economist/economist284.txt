<s>millions upon millions of leaders—perhaps even billions</s>
<s>thats what i see or hope to see in 2036</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>between now and then business will face daunting tests countries with ageing workforces trying to leverage the entrepreneurial energy of younger labour pools in places like china and india for example and questions of sustainability that bedevil all of society</s>
<s>these will be overtaken by new issues just as were learning to deal with the old ones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what will spark the innovation needed to address these</s>
<s>i believe the answer lies in a new kind of organisation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>todays hierarchical pyramid isnt equipped to tackle tomorrows challenges</s>
<s>instead we need organisations where trust based on transparency creates a culture of constant innovation where managers are as accountable to their employees as employees are to their bosses where responsibility for change is pushed down the ranks to young workers</s>
<s>we need organisations that put their “employees first” to drive innovation at the bottom of the pyramid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>instead of individuals holding leadership positions different people—depending on the situation and their specific talents—step forward to lead</s>
<s>and the traditional leader at the top</s>
<s>he or she is left with the job a crucial one of enabling and encouraging new leaders at every level</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i believe we will see a redefinition of organisational structure that will unleash individuals innovative drive and leadership talents to solve collectively the problems of the next quartercentury</s>
