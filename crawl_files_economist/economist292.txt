<s>as they prepare to retire or semiretire in 2012 chinas leaders are in no mood for risks</s>
<s>they would like to see out their terms with the countrys stimuluspowered economic gallop settling back into a brisk lowinflation trot</s>
<s>they will try to leave difficult decisions about economic and political reforms to their successors</s>
<s>but a smooth transfer of power is by no means assured</s>
<s>the coming year will be a trying one</s>

<p>
<s>the 90th anniversary of the founding of the communist party on july 1st 2011 will encourage dissidents and party liberals to raise difficult questions about the partys longstanding and unfulfilled promises to make the country more democratic</s>
<s>president hu jintao will have no desire to spend his remaining time in office taking up this challenge even though liberals will insist that further delay could be even more dangerous</s>
<s>he is all but certain though not constitutionally required to step down as party chief in late 2012 and has no choice but to step down as president in march 2013</s>
<s>he will stay on as supreme military commander for a year or two after that but will probably keep out of daytoday decisionmaking</s>

<s>mr hu and the prime minister wen jiabao pictured above who will also quit the politburos standing committee in 2012 and must give up the premiership in 2013 are more riskaverse than their predecessors were a decade ago when china was last heading towards a sweeping leadership change</s>
<s>on december 11th 2011 china will celebrate ten years of membership of the world trade organisation wto</s>
<s>the prime minister at the time zhu rongji supported by president jiang zemin pushed aggressively for wto accession despite strong reservations within powerful bureaucracies that feared native industries would be overwhelmed by foreign competition</s>
<s>foreign business leaders complain that mr hu and mr wen have been encouraging greater protectionism not more openness as they prepare to hand over</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their concerns will not be allayed by a new fiveyear economic plan which will be adopted by chinas rubberstamp parliament in march</s>
<s>the document will stress a fresh economicgrowth model that is less dependent on exports and energyintensive industry and more on domestic consumption</s>
<s>its targets for reducing carbon emissions will help boost chinas standing in climatechange negotiations</s>
<s>but foreign owners of green technologies will be disappointed by the plans call like the previous ones for “indigenous innovation”</s>
<s>foreign businesses say this in effect means giving preference to domestic firms</s>

<p>
<s>mr hu will try to ease american worries about access to the chinese market during a visit to washington early in 2011</s>
<s>he was last there in april 2010 but this will be his first trip during president obamas presidency with full state honours</s>
<s>for all chinas misgivings about american power mr hu will do his best not to let them show</s>
<s>chinese leaders like to use such visits to demonstrate their international standing to the public at home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr obama will similarly seek to avoid sharp exchanges over issues that worry americans such as the value of chinas currency and chinas military ambitions worries that will be fuelled in 2011 by china ousting america from a position it has held for 110 years as the worlds biggest manufacturer</s>
<s>highlevel military dialogue between china and america which china suspended in january 2010 because of american arms sales to taiwan will probably be resumed in the coming months</s>
<s>it will however remain frosty</s>

<s>taiwan itself will be a subject of growing concern to china in 2011 as the island prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections early in 2012</s>
<s>china badly wants president ma yingjeou to be reelected</s>
<s>but mr mas faltering popularity has shown little sign of gaining lift from chinas displays of goodwill since he took office in 2008 which included the launch of direct crossstrait flights and a freetrade agreement</s>
<s>another gesture that china may consider in the coming year is the freezing or even reduction of its missile deployments on the coast facing taiwan</s>
<s>but opposition politicians in taiwan would find this unconvincing in the absence of any monitoring mechanism something china is highly unlikely to agree to</s>

<p>
<s>the 100th anniversary on october 10th of the uprising that caused the collapse of chinas last imperial dynasty will be celebrated on both sides of the taiwan strait but not in collaboration</s>
<s>china is working on a starstudded film about the revolution to be released around the time of the anniversary</s>
<s>but it will avoid any recognition that the day is taiwans national day</s>
<s>much as it likes mr ma china will not accept the legitimacy of his government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china will also be fretting in 2011 about politics in hong kong where a new chief executive will take over from the incumbent donald tsang in 2012</s>
<s>henry tang the territorys top civil servant is a possible candidate as is leung chun ying the convener of mr tsangs cabinet</s>
<s>but china worries that none of the possible frontrunners enjoys much standing among the general public not that voters have a say in the matter</s>
<s>china is still haunted by memories of huge public protests against mr tsangs deeply unpopular predecessor tung cheehwa in 2003 which were among the causes of his eventual resignation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jockeying for leadership positions will become increasingly intense in china itself in the coming months</s>
<s>vicepresident xi jinping is certain to take over from mr hu and the deputy prime minister li keqiang from mr wen</s>
<s>other positions are still far from settled and will remain so well into 2012</s>
<s>but few advocates of democratic reform in china are optimistic that the next generation of leaders will be any less riskaverse</s>
