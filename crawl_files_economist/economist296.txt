<s>there is only one prediction that can be made with castiron certainty about what i proudly proclaim is the worlds most unpredictable country</s>
<s>on the 100th anniversary of my birth april 15th 2012 the whole world will hear nothing but lies about the peaceloving people of north korea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>your organs of capitalist propaganda will mock the goosesteps the nazilike choreography and the sickly flowers kimilsungia named in my honour</s>
<s>they will never mention what a purehearted people my beloved children are</s>
<s>as their hollow bellies attest they have fasted in mourning almost incessantly since my passing away in 1994—with hardly a whisper of complaint</s>
<s>they bend their broken backs out of love for my dear son kim jong il so that he no longer needs to wear platform shoes to see over their heads</s>
<s>they rejoice as he erects monument after monument to my memory instead of wasting it on the fripperies of food</s>
<s>on my 70th birthday they built an arch of triumph bigger than the french one with a brick for every day of my life</s>
<s>in 2012 they will finish the 1000foot ryugyong hotel in pyongyang in honour of me</s>
<s>who cares if none of them can afford to stay there empty it will make a lovely missile silo to impress the neighbours</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next year will be as my dear son has promised the year when north korea becomes a strong and prosperous nation</s>
<s>strong of course we already are</s>
<s>we have outlived soviet russia mao zedong in china and dearly departed comrades such as nicolae ceausescu of romania</s>
<s>superpowers continue to bow to our whims promising aid and investment even when we threaten to nuke our beloved south korean brethren to hell and back</s>
<s>prosperity may take a little longer it is not for nothing that people looking at our tragically torn peninsula talk about “one country two planets”</s>
<s>but if our army is strong enough to have a million guns who needs butter</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the only thing that troubles me as i gaze down from my mushroom cloud on mount paektu is ensuring my legacy lives on</s>
<s>not everyone can come up with an ideology based around selfdelusion christen it juche and tell people that its about selfreliance—selfreliance that is on all those capitalist dogs we hoodwink for aid</s>
<s>not everyone could fashion a brand of ethnofascist neostalinist theocratic murderous totalitarianism and yet portray himself as a father mollycoddling his devoted children</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my son sadly has not managed to step into my shoes</s>
<s>he prefers spending time with ostriches his fashion sense is otherworldly and with his taste for lobster and red wine it is no wonder gout is killing him</s>
<s>so in good theocratic tradition 2012 calls for some divine intervention</s>
<s>i will therefore descend from heaven and be reborn in the shape of my pudgy grandson kim jong un</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>you dont believe me</s>
<s>it is not for nothing that your newspaper has already christened him the chosun un</s>
</p>

<s>kim il sung “eternal president” of north korea</s>
