<s>the census was born amid fears of overcrowding and shortages the first modern headcount in 1801 followed thomas malthuss alarming projections about britains inability to feed itself</s>
<s>the census on march 27th 2011 will also reflect anxieties about britains overall numbers</s>
<s>the total population recorded in the censuses in england and wales scotland and northern ireland will climb to almost 63m souls</s>
<s>but although the instant headlines may concentrate on how full the islands of britain are supposedly becoming when the data are processed in 2012 they will tell a different story not of a crowded nation but of a lonely one</s>

<p>
<s>the census will reveal a sharp rise in the number of adults in their 20s who still live with their parents tethered to the family nest by a combination of limited economic opportunities and stillhigh property prices</s>
<s>yet it will also suggest that among affluent young people more are opting to live alone because they are settling down with partners later and eschewing the option of sharing with friends in favour of getting a foot on the property ladder</s>
<s>and it isnt only yuppies who will be shown to be living by themselves</s>
<s>so will several other kinds of britons</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>britains divorce rate has stabilised</s>
<s>but that trend disguises a rise in the overall separation rate</s>
<s>the number of couples who choose to cohabit rather than to marry has risen and their relationships tend to be even more fragile than modern marriages</s>
<s>so the overall separation rate is higher than the marriageonly divorce rate</s>
<s>as the census will enumerate this means a steadily rising number of separated people who are living by themselves</s>
<s>more too will be found to be living alone at the end of their lives after a partner dies</s>
<s>the ageing population will be another of the censuss headline themes</s>
<s>it will record that there are almost 15m people in britain aged 85 and over—and that the country is home to more pensioners than children</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people will be found to be working alone—at home—more than ever</s>
<s>in the sphere of work britain will emerge as a radically bifurcating country increasingly divided between the workaholic and the workshy</s>
<s>there will be a large number of households in which both the resident adults work worryingly long hours—and even more worryingly a large number in which no one works at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the census will of course set off some sort of kerfuffle over immigration</s>
<s>one interesting finding will be that the immigrant population especially eastern europeans has spread well beyond the big cities in which newcomers have historically clustered agriculture tourism and catering jobs will be seen to have drawn them to small towns and the countryside</s>
<s>the growing number of muslims will be noted</s>
<s>so will the habit especially in pakistanibritish households of britishborn adults importing spouses from the “old country” reinforcing fears about the insularity of some immigrant communities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an island within the isles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the people who will be made most cross by the immigration aspect of the census will be the immigrants themselves the form will ask them how long they intend to remain in britain which some will understandably complain implies that they are not all that welcome to stay</s>
<s>this is not a very useful question anyway since immigrants often say they intend to return home soon but in actuality never do a phenomenon described by demographers as the “myth of return”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the human story of the census is of disconnected individuals one of the largerscale inferences will be the way london has become even more distinct from the rest of the country</s>
<s>the capitals growing population will emerge as more foreign more ethnically diverse even less married and younger in part because of a trend for older people to move to neighbouring counties</s>
<s>more than ever london will look like a citystate</s>
