<s>they should call it mcluhans law after marshall mcluhan as inexorable as gravity or the doubling of processing power</s>
<s>new media technologies inevitably change the works they transmit—the medium becoming the message as the canadian scholar first observed</s>
<s>this fate has finally caught up with the book</s>
<s>if 2010 was the year ereaders and tablet computers entered the mainstream 2011 will be when the electronic reading vessel truly disrupts its content</s>
<s>on multipurpose mobile devices from smartphones to the ipad and its emerging competitors the book will cease to be a book</s>
<s>it will be an “app”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ereaders and computing tablets will continue their impressive momentum</s>
<s>the number of americans owning a dedicated reading device trebled in 2010 to 11m and will pass 15m in 2011 according to forrester research</s>
<s>the ipad took off even faster than the iphone did a few years back</s>
<s>in 2010 apple sold about 15m of its sexy touchscreen devices prompting real competition ereaders suddenly became affordable</s>
<s>amazon slashed the price of its kindle</s>
<s>barnes  noble and sony followed suit</s>

<s>this price war will continue in 2011</s>
<s>decent ereaders will cost less than $100</s>
<s>clones sold in developing countries will be even cheaper</s>
<s>big retailers may give the devices away</s>
<s>the technology will also get better longer battery life more memory colour touchnavigation and annotation</s>
<s>wireless access for downloads will become standard for higherend devices</s>
<s>even so computing tablets will continue to outsell ereaders forrester predicts putting pressure on amazon and others to nudge their devices towards interactivity</s>

<s>ebooks should get cheaper too</s>
<s>thanks to competition from apple in 2010 publishers revolted against amazons $999 pricing for ebooks—and forced the firm to accept the “agency model” in which publishers set the retail price splitting revenues 7030 with retailers</s>
<s>that drove the average ebook price up to around $13 but in 2011 it will again come under pressure because of increased competition</s>
<s>the year will probably see the launch of google editions the third big ebook retailer after amazon and apple</s>
<s>all this will drive ebook sales</s>
<s>of trade books sold in america in 2010 nearly 10 were electronic</s>
<s>in 2011 this will rise to at least 20</s>

<p>
<s>most fundamentally the proliferation of new devices will transform the book itself</s>
<s>in 2010 publishers got their first glimpse of wonderland an ipad version of lewis carrolls classic showed how much is possible</s>
<s>among other things it lets users tilt the device and watch alice shrink or grow</s>
<s>other titles let parents record their voices reading to their tots</s>
<s>“diginovels” feature video clips that supplement or replace bits of text</s>
<s>textbooks too are becoming interactive with 3d clips of helixes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given this technical explosion it is no surprise that the book itself is shifting shape—and becoming a downloadable application or “app”</s>
<s>this allows publishers not simply to make books interactive but to protect them from being copied glean how they are read and even sneak in some advertising</s>
<s>“marketplaces” for apps already offer thousands of “book apps” to download</s>

<p>
<s>what will all this mean for readers and reading</s>
<s>an activity that has barely changed for half a millennium is poised to fragment dramatically</s>
<s>first there will be a split between the kinds of books that lend themselves to bells and whistles—mostly nonfiction—and those that do not mainly novels</s>
<s>but even traditional storytelling will adapt the new mobility has already spawned forms like the japanese phone novel and it will give a boost to the old form of the short story</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second a divide will open between different types of readers</s>
<s>battle lines are being drawn between those who cherish paper and those who embrace ereaders or networked “bapps”</s>
<s>publishers will want to watch such preferences closely—and watch their backs</s>
<s>the third relationship to fragment will be that between writer and publisher</s>
<s>the most popular authors have shown they can bypass editors and sell directly to ebook retailers</s>
<s>new authors excluded from the existing food chain will sell their own etitles too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the printed book will never entirely die as devotees of vinyl and film have shown</s>
<s>nor should it human knowledge is too precious to consign to the ether alone</s>
