<s>will angela merkel the german chancellor weep or cheer when the clock strikes 12 on new years eve</s>
<s>in late 2010 the german economy was being feted as the wonder of europe</s>
<s>yet it was a year of political trauma</s>
<s>in bailing out greece germany felt betrayed by its membership of the euro zone</s>
<s>in may the partners in mrs merkels centreright “christianliberal” coalition the christian democratic union cdu and the free democratic party fdp lost an important state election</s>
<s>the federal president quit suddenly and mrs merkels candidate to succeed him came within a whisker of defeat</s>
<s>towards the end of 2010 the polls were saying that voters would evict her government from office if they had a chance</s>
<s>in 2011 the economy is expected to slacken</s>
<s>mrs merkel has a chance to repair her political fortunes but it will not be easy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dependent on exports germany suffered more than most rich economies during the global recession but has bounced back faster</s>
<s>after shrinking by 47 in 2009 gdp probably grew by about 35 in 2010</s>
<s>its 9 annualised growth rate in the second quarter was the fastest since the countrys unification in 1990</s>
<s>impressively employment barely wavered in the slump</s>
<s>the government helped with a fiscal stimulus which included subsidies for companies to retain workers and exporters were loth to sack skilled workers they would need when recovery came</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2011 germany will start withdrawing the stimulus</s>
<s>the federal government plans to save €80 billion $112 billion over four years to meet deficit targets set by the european union and by its own constitution</s>
<s>the global austerity drive will slow trade growth blunting germanys recovery</s>
<s>forecasts for gdp growth in 2011 are modest between 1 and 2</s>
<s>domestic consumption is taking over from exports as the economic driver which will mollify—slightly—trading partners who complain of germanys persistent trade surpluses</s>
<s>unemployment is expected to fall to its lowest levels since 1992</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but voters are not grateful</s>
<s>mrs merkel whose first government was a marriage of convenience with the social democratic party spd proclaimed the cdufdp partnership in office since october 2009 a love match</s>
<s>but the partners have rowed over health reform and over whether to give priority to deficit reduction or to tax cuts as the fdp had demanded</s>
<s>the fdps chief guido westerwelle is also foreign minister a job that normally confers popularity as a perk</s>
<s>yet he is among the least popular politicians</s>
<s>mrs merkel dragged her cdu towards the political middle to win elections</s>
<s>the partys core supporters never liked the tactic and now are starting to doubt the payoff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the coalitions popularity will be tested in the six of the 16 länder states which will hold elections in 2011</s>
<s>a key contest will be in march in badenwürttemberg which the cdu has governed since 1953</s>
<s>there a christianliberal coalition faces an unaccustomed threat from the spd and the resurgent green party</s>
<s>a loss would be a disaster for mrs merkel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a change of colour</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the greens performance could be the big story of 2011</s>
<s>the smallest force in the bundestag they threaten to eclipse the spd as the most popular opposition party in some states</s>
<s>they could lead statelevel government for the first time if not in badenwürttemberg then perhaps in berlin which votes in the autumn</s>
<s>this could transform politics which has been dominated by the “bigtent” cdu and spd</s>
<s>mrs merkel had considered the greens as partners in a future coalition</s>
<s>that prospect has been dimmed by her decision to extend a 2022 deadline for phasing out nuclear power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>can mrs merkel recover</s>
<s>after nearly a year of avoiding tough decisions she has started to act</s>
<s>cdu leaders approved an end to conscription the government backed a minimal increase in welfare payments to comply with a constitutionalcourt judgment</s>
<s>along with the nuclear extension this has sharpened conflict with the opposition and triggered street demonstrations</s>
<s>but supporters who think her too passive have been heartened</s>
<s>in 2011 the government will simplify taxes instead of cutting them which may help the beleaguered fdp</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there are pitfalls</s>
<s>immigration has become a more combustible issue since the publication in august of a muslimbashing book by thilo sarrazin who resigned from the bundesbanks board</s>
<s>in may germany will have to open its labour market to recent eu members</s>
<s>trade unions fearing “wage dumping” want an extension of the minimum wage business is pressing for more immigration of skilled labour</s>
<s>further welfare reforms could be contentious</s>
<s>luckily for mrs merkel she need not face the voters again until 2013</s>
