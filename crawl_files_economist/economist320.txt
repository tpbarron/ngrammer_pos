<s>as a kid i would have said wed be eating roastdinner spaceage capsules by 2036 but as a chef campaigner and father i now take the future of food much more seriously</s>
<s>in the countries i visit regularly—britain america australia germany the netherlands—the impact of rising obesity levels and dietrelated diseases is causing a terrible unsustainable strain on health care and other social services</s>
<s>a lack of food knowledge and cooking skills coupled with the rise of cheap processed foods is most definitely to blame for this new epidemic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im also aware that global food production is having a huge impact on the environment</s>
<s>there will be many more people on the planet by 2036 and—lets face it—not enough food to go around if we continue consuming and wasting food the way we have been</s>
<s>and when you add overfarming overfishing and climate change to the mix you have to wonder if many of todays ingredients will even be available 25 years from now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>im convinced the best way to face the future and tackle these dietrelated problems is to arm people with knowledge and skills</s>
<s>the more people understand food the more likely they are to respect it</s>
<s>the beauty of knowing how to cook is that it makes you resilient adaptable and resourceful no matter what ingredients you have in front of you</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>because i like to stay positive i believe the future of food could be good so long as governments retailers and consumers work together to put more emphasis on food education for both kids and adults</s>
<s>if we put the hard work in now well be better equipped to face the future—whatever it looks like</s>
