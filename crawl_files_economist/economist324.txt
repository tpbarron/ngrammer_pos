<s>a change of government a new president and a small dollop of economic growth are in store for the irish in 2011</s>
<s>high unemployment and grinding austerity will be their lot too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after a decade and a half of uninterrupted boom to 2007 the irish economy suffered one of the deepest and longest busts in the rich world</s>
<s>in 2011 the fixing of broken banks will continue in stops and starts and another year of austerity will narrow a massive imbalance between government spending and much reduced tax receipts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even this may not be enough</s>
<s>irelands problems are so severe that a greekstyle bailout by the eu and imf cannot be ruled out in 2011</s>
<s>whether or not this happens indebted households will need the year—and a few more thereafter—to rebuild balancesheets distorted by collapsed property prices</s>
<s>the tumble in house prices could hit bottom in 2011 with a low likely at about half the 2007 peak</s>
<s>despite all this the economy should grow a little in 2011</s>
<s>it will not however be enough to shorten the dole queues by much the rate of joblessness will remain stubbornly in the teens one of the highest in europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>little wonder that irish folk are less than cheery</s>
<s>they seethe at the costs of bailing out banks which at anywhere between 25 and 50 of gdp are gargantuan and many rage against the government for placing the economy in such a pickle</s>

<p>
<s>the ruling twoparty coalition has a mandate until 2012 but its waferthin parliamentary majority is crumbling</s>
<s>few believe it can stumble on much longer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the coalition is dominated by fianna fail a catchall centrist party which has been in power for all but 30 months of the past quartercentury</s>
<s>the tiny green party joined it in government in 2007</s>
<s>since the bust the combination has been held together by the fear of precipitating an election</s>
<s>with the popularity of both parties in a trough they have clung together hoping the worst will have passed before they have to face the voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but devastation is now the coalitions destiny regardless of when the poll comes and the new government will be led by fine gael—also a catchall centrist party that has always struggled to differentiate itself from fianna fail</s>
<s>the party pinches itself at the prospect that it could overtake its great rival and this despite a leader enda kenny who is derided as a lightweight</s>
<s>the perennial thirdplacers in parliamentary elections—the motley labour party—benefit from a serioussounding leader eamon gilmore whose popularity far exceeds that of his counterparts in the two larger parties</s>
<s>by years end mr kenny will be taoiseach prime minister and mr gilmore his deputy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if by a miracle the government manages to hang on through 2011 voters will still get a chance to have their say</s>
<s>in november a presidential election must take place</s>
<s>after two terms the incumbent mary mcaleese is constitutionally barred from running again</s>
<s>although the job is largely ceremonial this looks set to be the most hotly contested race in two decades</s>
<s>one way or another change at the top is coming to ireland in 2011</s>
