<s>in september britain’s human fertilisation and embryology authority launched a public consultation on what sounds like a crackpot idea to create children with three genetic parents</s>
<s>yet this could be a way to eliminate a set of rare but nasty diseases caused by problems with pieces of cellular machinery called mitochondria</s>
<s>according to research published this week see article the basic technique of substituting problemfree mitochondria has now been tested in a laboratory and the researchers seem confident that given the green light they could bring a healthy child into the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most of a child’s genes would come from the couple it would learn to call mum and dad</s>
<s>a tiny fraction of the dna however would come from a female donor who would provide part of the egg from which the child grew</s>
<s>at present the law in britain like that in most other places prohibits any genetic modification of embryos</s>
<s>it should be changed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an ingeneious idea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mitochondria turn the energy in sugar into a form a cell can use so if they go wrong the consequences are dire</s>
<s>the brain the nerves and the muscles all huge consumers of energy are the organs that suffer most</s>
<s>mitochondria are also special because they contain their own genes completely separate from those in the cell nucleus which are thus transmitted from mother to child in the egg</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some mitochondrial disease is caused by mutations in these genes and is thus also inherited solely from the mother</s>
<s>such diseases affect one person in 5000 during his or her lifetime</s>
<s>but the separateness of mitochondrial genes means that by moving the nucleus from an afflicted egg into a healthy one the mutated diseasecausing genes can be left behind</s>
<s>in effect the nucleus would receive a mitochondrial transplant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this incorporation of the dna of two women might be seen by the nervous as a step down the slippery slope towards the genetic engineering of people</s>
<s>but that is unlikely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the principal worry about genetic engineering is that it will lead to “designer babies” with customised dna</s>
<s>but mitochondrial transplants involve no tinkering with the dna itself</s>
<s>though on a microscopic scale the process is quite like a heart liver or kidney transplant with the caveat that the transplant will be passed on to the recipient’s children if she is female</s>
<s>any organ transplant introduces new genes into the body</s>
<s>mitochondrial genes are ubiquitous it is true but this difference is one of degree not kind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another reason not to worry is that the mitochondria carry only 37 genes compared with about 20000 in the cell nucleus and these genes are exclusively concerned with energy metabolism</s>
<s>pushy parents will not be picking mitochondrial donors on the basis of looks personality or intelligence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nonbiological objections are sometimes raised as well</s>
<s>some worry for instance that a person with three genetic parents might suffer an identity crisis</s>
<s>but that seems less likely than in the case of people conceived by in vitro fertilisation using sperm donated by strangers who have contributed half of their offspring’s genes not a paltry three dozen</s>
<s>and for that reason mitochondrial donors are even less likely than sperm donors to want to be involved with bringing up children in whom they have but a fractional genetic interest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but is the process safe</s>
<s>doing the experiment is the only way of finding out</s>
<s>it should be preceded by a lot of tests in petri dishes and laboratory animals</s>
<s>but in the end you just have to try it and see</s>
