<s>people at hedge funds speak fondly of their industrys feral roots</s>
<s>“hedge funds used to be set up by two guys in a back alley with a flashlight” says one veteran</s>
<s>kenneth griffin the boss of citadel decided to launch a fund after he traded bonds from his college dormitory room according to industry lore</s>
<s>hedge funds are infamous for being scrappy and secretive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this has started to change however</s>
<s>hedge funds used to celebrate their ability to rake in “absolute returns” no matter the economic environment</s>
<s>but that promise proved false when they plunged by 19 in 2008</s>
<s>this shook investors</s>
<s>so did bernie madoffs ponzi scheme which came to light that same year</s>
<s>in response investors started to ask for more transparency and more thorough due diligence before writing big cheques</s>

<s>hello sec</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to restore confidence hedge funds have tried to shed their reputation for being flybynight operations</s>
<s>they want to be seen as established reliable businesses</s>
<s>managers used to update investors quarterly only to inform them of the funds performance now they take pains to explain the funds strategy</s>
<s>funds have also invested more in reporting systems to help woo investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this trend for the hedgefund industry to abandon its opacity will accelerate over the coming year</s>
<s>hedge funds have always operated without much government oversight but from 2011 that will no longer be the case</s>
<s>a provision in americas financialreform bill requires all hedge funds with $150m or more under management a fairly small amount by industry standards to register with the securities and exchange commission sec designate or hire a compliance officer and maintain thorough trading records</s>
<s>this must all happen by july 2011</s>
<s>it will mark a new era for hedge funds which fought against sec registration</s>
<s>as a result of this regulation oversight of hedgefund activities will be greater as will the cost of launching and operating a fund</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this will lead to another trend in 2011 consolidation</s>
<s>hiring a compliance officer and spending more on internal operations will be a financial burden particularly at a time when fundraising is difficult</s>
<s>some smaller hedge funds will close or sell themselves to larger ones</s>
<s>others will arrange to share backoffice operations with a larger fund in exchange for a cut of their returns</s>
<s>the result will be an industry that shrinks in number of funds and sees more assets going to the giants away from less established shops</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this consolidation may ultimately affect the returns that hedge funds will be able to achieve in the coming years</s>
<s>the most impressive gains in the industry have typically come from the smallest youngest funds which tend to be more nimble and entrepreneurial</s>
<s>the question of what to expect from funds returns and whether they will normalise at precrisis levels will play out over the next few years</s>
<s>one thing however should encourage investors to “go long” on hedge funds in 2011 it surely cant be as devastating as 2008</s>
