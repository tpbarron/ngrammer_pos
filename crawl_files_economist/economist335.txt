<p>
<s>although deadly quakes are rarely blamed on human activity it is fashionable to blame weatherrelated disasters on global warming</s>
<s>it does seem plausible warm air worsens droughts and lets tropical air hold more moisture the fuel for cyclones weather formations that include hurricanes and typhoons</s>
<s>however a recent study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change which represents the consensus among thousands of scientists expressed little confidence in any link between climate change and the frequency of tropical cyclones</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the world has succeeded in making natural disasters less deadly through better earlywarning systems for tsunamis better public information about evacuation plans tougher building codes in quakeprone areas and encouragement for homeowners to adopt simple precautions such as installing tornadoproof rooms in their homes</s>
<s>annual death tolls are heavily influenced by outliers such as haitis earthquake in 2010 which killed more than 200000 or the bangladeshi cyclones in 1970 300000</s>
<s>but adjusted for the earths growing population the trend in death rates is clearly downward</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however even if natural disasters may be no more common and no more likely to kill people than before there is no doubt that their economic cost is rising</s>
<s>this is because a growing share of the worlds population and economic activity is being concentrated in disasterprone places on tropical coasts and river deltas near forests and along earthquake fault lines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thailand is an example of this</s>
<s>since its last serious floods in 1983 and 1995 the countrys exportoriented industrial base has grown rapidly in the provinces around bangkok and farther north along the chao phraya river</s>
<s>ammar siamwalla a thai economist notes that the central plain where many industrial estates now sit was once heavily cultivated for rice precisely because it floods regularly</s>

<p>
<s>whether the economic toll of disasters is rising faster than global gdp is unclear since a wealthier world naturally has more wealth at risk</s>
<s>still the incidence of spectacular multibilliondollar catastrophes seems certain to rise</s>
<s>a 2007 study led by the oecd reckoned that by 2070 seven of the ten greatest urban concentrations of economic assets buildings infrastructure and the like that are exposed to coastal flooding will be in the developing world none was in 2005</s>
<s>in that time assets exposed to such flooding will rise from 5 of world gdp to 9</s>
<s>a world bank study led by apurva sanghi estimated that between 2000 and 2050 the city populations exposed to tropical cyclones or earthquakes will more than double rising from 11 to 16 of the worlds population</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>development by its nature also aggravates risks</s>
<s>as cities encroach on coasts wetlands and rivers natural barriers such as mangrove swamps and sand dunes are obliterated and artificial ones—dykes and sea walls—are erected to keep the water out</s>
<s>the result is to put more people and property in harms way if those barriers fail</s>
<s>after the second world war japan embarked on a vigorous programme of building seawalls and dykes to protect its cities against storm surges and tsunamis</s>
<s>that in turn encouraged cities growth and industrialisation but for the same reason exposed them to damage if a tsunami overwhelmed their defences as it did in march</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as cities on river deltas extract groundwater for industry drinking and sanitation the ground subsides putting it further below sea level and thus requiring even higher dykes</s>
<s>since 1980 jakartas population has more than doubled to 24m and should reach 35m by 2020</s>
<s>land that once absorbed overflow from the citys 13 rivers has been developed and is now subsiding 40 of the city is now below sea level</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>perverse incentives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people originally settled in river deltas precisely because regular flooding made the land so fertile</s>
<s>those cities have continued to grow because of the natural economic advantages such concentrations of human talent hold for modernising societies</s>
<s>even when poor people moving to cities know they are increasing their risk of dying in a mudslide or flood that is more than compensated for by the betterpaying work available in cities</s>
<s>and in rich countries coasts are gaining population simply because people like living near water</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>perverse incentives are also at work</s>
<s>in america homeowners on floodplains must have flood insurance to get a federally backed mortgage</s>
<s>but federal insurance is often subsidised and many people are either exempt from the rule or live in places where flood risks have not been properly mapped</s>
<s>some do not buy disaster insurance assuming they can count on federal aid if their home is destroyed</s>
<s>once the government declares a disaster it pays 75100 of the response costs</s>
<s>presidents have found it increasingly hard to turn down pleas from local leaders for assistance especially in election years</s>
<s>matt mayer of the heritage foundation a conservative thinktank says the government routinely takes charge of local disasters that should be well within a states capability</s>
<s>the result is that state disastermanagement atrophies and disaster funding ends up subsidising disasterprone places like florida at the expense of safer states like ohio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as a consequence of these skewed incentives people routinely rebuild in areas that have already been devastated</s>
<s>bob meyer of the wharton school gives the example of pass christian a resort town in mississippi where an apartment complex was destroyed by hurricane camille in 1969 killing 21 people who had taken refuge inside</s>
<s>a shopping centre and condominiums were later built in the same area only to be wiped out by hurricane katrina in 2005 since when more new condominiums have gone up nearby</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is not all because of incentives</s>
<s>as mr meyer says people have a tendency not to price rare unpredictable events into their decisions even if these may have catastrophic consequences</s>
<s>leo “chipper” mcdermott the mayor of pass christian notes that more than three decades elapsed between camille and katrina</s>
<s>“life is a chance</s>
<s>and let me tell you something else water sells”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if human nature cannot be changed government policy can be</s>
<s>that might mean spending more on preventing disaster so as to cut its costs</s>
<s>roughly 20 of humanitarian aid is now spent responding to disasters whereas a paltry but rising 07 is spent on preventive measures taken to mitigate their possible consequences according to the world bank</s>

<p>
<s>a dutch rethink</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the netherlands whose existence has long been at the mercy of nature may be at the forefront of rethinking how to cope with it</s>
<s>some 60 of the country is either under sea level or at risk of regular flooding from the north sea or the rhine meuse and schelt rivers and their tributaries</s>
<s>in 1953 a combination of a high spring tide and severe storm over the north sea overwhelmed dykes flooding 9 of its farmland and killing 1800 people</s>
<s>the country responded with a decadeslong programme of “delta works” to guard estuaries from storm surges while raising and strengthening dykes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the success of those defences has perversely made the consequences of failure even greater says piet dircke of arcadis a dutch engineering firm specialising in water management</s>
<s>protected by the delta works and dykes the land stretching from amsterdam to rotterdam has heavily industrialised and now provides most of the countrys output</s>
<s>“the northern and southern parts of the netherlands are far more safe but are economically less attractive</s>
<s>people are moving to the western part of holland because its where the economy grows”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 1993 and again in 1995 heavy river flooding inundated the countryside and nearly rose above dykes in population centres forcing the evacuation of more than 250000 people</s>
<s>katrina was the final wakeup call making the dutch face up to both the unreliability of forecasts of onceinacentury events and the impossibility of their repeating the american feat of evacuating a million people</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the countrys philosophy of flood control has as a result pivoted from building ever higher dykes to instead making its cities and countryside more resilient to floodwaters</s>
<s>in 2007 it launched its €23 billion “room for the river” project</s>
<s>at 39 locations along the meuse rhine ijssel and waal rivers dykes are being moved inland riverbeds deepened and fields now occupied by farms and households deliberately exposed to floods</s>
<s>the dutch invented the word “polder” centuries ago to describe dry land created by enclosing floodplains or shallow waters with dykes</s>
<s>they are now “depolderising” removing or lowering the surrounding dykes and turning land back into floodplains</s>
<s>the rhines maximum flow without causing disaster will be raised from 15000 cubic metres a second to 16000 and eventually 18000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the noordwaard polder southeast of rotterdam was floodplain until 1973 when the delta works made it suitable for cattle and vegetables</s>
<s>it is now being turned back into floodplain to absorb floodwaters that might otherwise inundate cities upstream</s>
<s>to do so the government had to persuade 18 farmers to move or have their farmhouses raised</s>
<s>wim de wit who raises 75 cattle on the farm his father started in 1979 chose the latter</s>
<s>near his farmhouse earthmoving equipment is building a mound or “terp” on which a new one will sit safe from the periodic floods that will follow</s>
<s>it will not be pleasant mr de wit acknowledges “but its only once every 25 years” and if he loses any crops or cattle to floods the government will compensate him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the dutch are building an industry of promoting their watermanagement philosophy around the world</s>
<s>deltares a research institute recommends that the thai government emulate room for the river by moving dykes farther back where possible limiting floodplain development and unifying water management so that safety is no longer subservient to irrigation and electricity generation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the dutch approach has limits</s>
<s>for one thing it is costly</s>
<s>farmers were paid market value to leave the polders</s>
<s>to do this in a more densely populated city or industrial area would be prohibitively expensive</s>
<s>in america and china the government has long had the right to breach dykes and periodically inundate occupied land to relieve extreme flooding</s>
<s>jaap kwadijk of deltares notes that the dutch government has previously rejected doing the same thing</s>
<s>if a flood comes along that exceeds even the very high designed capacity of the dykes “we dont have a plan b”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if cities cannot be moved they must like the polder farms be made more resilient to disaster</s>
<s>rather than rely on dykes to keep water out rotterdam is also trying to mitigate the consequences if water comes in</s>
<s>a 10000cubicmetre tank was built into a new car park big enough to catch roughly 25 of the water from a onceincentury flood</s>
<s>a public plaza has been designed to turn into wading pools when it fills with rainwater</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the citys harbour sits a floating pavilion shaped like three halved footballs built on huge blocks of foam</s>
<s>it is a model for the floating communities the city hopes might one day repopulate the docklands whose traditional shipping activities are moving elsewhere</s>
<s>pieter figdor one of the pavilions architects says floating buildings can be up to seven storeys tall are inherently floodproof and can easily be moved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wealth protection</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>making cities more resilient involves starker tradeoffs in the developing world</s>
<s>on the one hand urbanisation strips cities of their natural defences against disaster and exposes more people to loss of life and property when an earthquake or cyclone hits</s>
<s>on the other hand urbanisation makes poor people richer</s>
<s>the density and infrastructure of cities makes people more productive and more able to afford the measures needed to keep them safe</s>
<s>so mitigation measures should not discourage people from crowding into vulnerable cities but rather establish incentives for cities and their inhabitants to protect themselves better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many cities have tough building codes but fail to enforce them</s>
<s>the world bank study argues that giving more urban dwellers title to their property would encourage investment in their safety and lifting rent controls would encourage landlords to comply with building codes since they could then recoup the cost</s>
<s>ordinary infrastructure can be designed to double as disaster protection ensuring that it will be properly maintained when the time comes</s>
<s>two examples the world bank gives are schools built on higher ground that double as cyclone shelters and a road tunnel in kuala lumpur that doubles as a floodcontainment tank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as societies develop they can afford the human and physical infrastructure needed to protect against and respond to natural disaster</s>
<s>in time last years earthquake and tsunami and floods will be mere blips in the gdp of japan and thailand thanks to the rapid reconstruction made possible by the same wealth that meant the disasters were so costly to start with</s>
<s>the lesson for poorer countries is that growth is the best disastermitigation policy of all</s>
