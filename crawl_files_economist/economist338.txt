<s>americans are an optimistic people but it doesnt show in their feelings about the economy</s>
<s>consumer confidence is depressed polls show growing disenchantment at barack obamas handling of the economy and even mr obama cant seem to muster the sunny bromides that are the staple of presidential speeches on the subject</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pessimism also permeates economists forecasts</s>
<s>every month the economist polls economists in order to produce a consensus forecast the consensus in october 2010 was for growth in 2011 of just 24</s>
<s>the economist intelligence unit as reported in “the world in figures” section of this edition envisages growth of a mere 15</s>
<s> that consensus figure is roughly the economys longrun potential growth rate meaning it would create just enough jobs to keep up with the growing population</s>
<s>in other words the consensus sees little likelihood of the unemployment rate falling from its level in the third quarter of 96</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is too gloomy</s>
<s>in 2011 americas economy will surprise the pessimists</s>
<s>it will grow faster than 3 and unemployment should fall to 9 and probably lower</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet this is still far from the boom americans could rightfully expect</s>
<s>the strength of recovery is typically proportionate to the depth of recession</s>
<s>the reason is that recessions are usually brought on by tight monetary policy</s>
<s>once monetary policy loosens enough suppressed demand is unleashed and quickly uses up the spare capacity left over from the recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this however is not a typical recovery</s>
<s>since it began in mid2009 the american economy has followed the postcrisis path of expansion already taken by countries emerging from similar financial crackups</s>
<s>the bungedup financial system has not allowed lower interest rates to work their magic on commerce</s>
<s>capitalconstrained banks are reluctant to lend and households saddled with homes worth less than their mortgages cant or wont borrow</s>
<s>they are trying to save more and pay down debt a process called deleveraging</s>
<s>through mid2010 bank credit continued to contract</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are other factors holding back the recovery</s>
<s>the federal reserve like most major central banks has already lowered its shortterm interest rate its main policy lever in effect to zero</s>
<s>many of americas big trading partners like japan and europe also have moribund economies so they cannot substitute for lost demand from american consumers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the mend shakily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in spite of this there will be a recovery</s>
<s>over time the headwinds of consumers paying down debt will fade</s>
<s>the process is about halfway done</s>
<s>personal saving had already risen to 6 of income by the summer of 2010 from under 2 in 2005</s>
<s>some optimistically reckon thats as high as it needs to go</s>
<s>meanwhile household debt peaked at 135 of disposable income in late 2007 by the middle of 2010 it had fallen to 123</s>
<s>economists at deutsche bank project that if the saving rate stays at 6 banks continue to write off bad loans at their current rate and income grows by about 45 a year that ratio will be down to 107 by the end of 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if this debtreduction is gradual enough households can save more and spend more at the same time</s>
<s>however this assumes that they are not hit by some shock to their incomes such as a rebound in unemployment a large increase in taxes higher interest rates or a new surge in oil prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>american policymakers are predisposed to activism and thus do all they can to minimise such risks</s>
<s>the federal reserve has already ventured deeply into “quantitative easing” qe that is purchasing bonds with newly printed money</s>
<s>qe stimulates demand in two ways</s>
<s>first it lowers longterm interest rates which encourages borrowing</s>
<s>second banks and other investors unhappy with the skimpy returns on their cash invest in riskier assets such as stocks and corporate loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>qe is not guaranteed to work</s>
<s>the bank of japan tried it from 2001 to 2006 but didnt end deflation or spur significant loan growth</s>
<s>to the fed thats probably because it waited until it was too late and then did too little</s>
<s>the fed believes it can accomplish a lot with monetary policy if it is sufficiently vigorous</s>
<s>it has already bought bonds worth $175 trillion or some 12 of gdp in japan the equivalent figure in the 2000s was about 8 and in 2011 it could buy $1 trillion more</s>
<s>this will hold longterm interest rates below 3 and drive some money into stocks boosting corporate spirits</s>
<s>the feds aggressive stance will chisel away at the dollar helping to narrow americas trade deficit and boost growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately fiscal policy will be working against recovery</s>
<s>the expiration of mr obamas stimulus will squeeze the economy in early 2011 as will state and local government belttightening</s>
<s>to offset this the white house will at best persuade congress with its beefedup republican contingent to agree to only a trivial new stimulus</s>
<s>the squeeze could become suffocating if george bushs tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of 2010</s>
<s>this is why republicans and democrats will in the end set aside their partisan venom and temporarily extend the cuts at least through 2011</s>
<s>the growing federal debt will remain a timebomb but it wont explode during 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what could go wrong</s>
<s>growing american resentment at chinas mercantilist currency policy could degenerate into a trade war that stifles trade flows and shatters business confidence</s>
<s>partisan rancour could paralyse action on taxes and lead to a dramatic fiscal tightening</s>
<s>and personal incomes could flatten out instead of growing</s>
<s>after all inflation at 1 and wage growth at 2 were exceptionally low in 2010 and will probably remain so in 2011</s>
<s>if they slide further perhaps into deflation territory consumers will have to pare their spending even more to get their debt burdens down and businesses will be even less inclined to hire and to invest</s>
<s>such a turn of events would vindicate americans pessimism</s>
