<s>over the next 12 months financialsector reform will go from design to implementation</s>
<s>in the process industrial countries will strike a different mediumterm tradeoff between growth and stability</s>
<s>and this will be part of a much larger global structural change characterised by a multiyear shift in the balance between markets and governments and an accelerated realignment in global growth and wealth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>richworld governments will use 2011 to put in place detailed measures that derisk and slim down the banking system</s>
<s>in doing so they will use the trio of regulation enforcement and taxation</s>
<s>and they will hope to limit the amount of future economic growth that is sacrificed for greater financial stability</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the phenomenon will be most visible in britain and america the two economies that aided and most strongly abetted the expansion of finance</s>
<s>indeed too many people in these countries incorrectly viewed finance as the next stage in the natural maturation of an advanced economy—from agriculture to industry to services and to finance</s>
<s>this bet went disastrously wrong in 2008 with governments and their electorates being painfully reminded of a truth which thoughtful people have known for a long time finance is not an end in itself rather it is a means of servicing the economy as a whole</s>
<s>finance cannot expand well ahead of economic realities without getting itself into significant trouble</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the end of 2011 industrial countries will be well on their way to reversing this secular bet on finance</s>
<s>banks will be smaller in scope limited to focusing on clientfacing activities and compelled to forgo most proprietary trading</s>
<s>they will be subject to more effective supervision</s>
<s>they will be abiding by stricter regulations on the level and quality of their prudential capital</s>
<s>they will not be allowed to lever their balancesheets at will</s>
<s>and they will face higher implicit and explicit taxation that will further lower their return on capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the process the banking sector will take a major step away from casinotype activities and towards the utility model</s>
<s>banks will remain profitable but much less so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2011 banks will also start paying off the cheap debt they raised in 2009 using government guarantees</s>
<s>the steep yield curve of 2010—which allowed banks to raise shortterm deposits at essentially zero cost and buy higheryielding government debt—may well flatten and take away a lucrative and lowrisk way to generate earnings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in sum banks will become well more boring</s>
<s>undoubtedly this will reduce for a while the probability of banking accidents</s>
<s>also there will be less scope for the morally objectionable 200409 phenomenon in which huge gains were privatised and massive losses were socialised</s>
<s>we should welcome this change</s>
<s>we should also be aware that like most things in life it is neither costless nor free of risks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the derisking of banks in industrial countries will be another factor complicating an already anaemic economic recovery particularly in america</s>
<s>less risktaking by banks translates into lower credit overall and an excessive bias in favour of lending to large companies</s>
<s>this in turn will contribute to stubbornly high unemployment skillerosion recurrent budgetary concerns and significant pressure on weak social safetynets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bumpy road ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the shrinkage in richcountry finance in 2011 will contrast sharply with an expansion of finance in emerging economies</s>
<s>financial institutions headquartered in emerging countries will gradually and carefully expand their global activities</s>
<s>their profitable and relatively stable domestic anchors will enable them to capture global market share</s>
<s>again this is part of a broader trend that of a further migration of growth and wealth from the rich world to emerging economies</s>
<s>here also the process will not be without risks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it will stress an already outmoded globalgovernance system in which leading western powers remain hesitant to give up their historical entitlements</s>
<s>it will raise the risk of protectionism fuelled by persistently high unemployment in the west</s>
<s>and it will increase the challenges which emerging economies face in managing success</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the world will discover in 2011 that the tradeoffs inherent in financial reform are not easy to get right</s>
<s>they are part of the tugofwar between efficiencyenhancing liberalisation which was taken too far and safety and soundness which can also be taken too far</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after the massive financial accidents of 200809 industrial countries are understandably opting to lower the speed limit on financial firms</s>
<s>we are going from the infamous german autobahn with its lack of speed limits to a more heavily policed motorway with speed bumps all along the road</s>
<s>this is part of a much broader historical phenomenon</s>
<s>let us hope that it evolves with great care lest it result in yet another series of accidents</s>
