<s>“it truly is a new era at microsoft” gushed steve ballmer the giant software company’s boss in a letter to shareholders this month</s>
<s>for once such grandiloquence seems justified</s>
<s>on october 26th windows 8 the newest version of microsoft’s operating system for personal computers is due to be released</s>
<s>it looks very different from past editions it is designed for touchscreens on both pcs and tablets and it can run on processors designed by arm a british company whose allies dominate mobile devices as well as chips made by intel microsoft’s longterm partner</s>
<s>also on sale will be the surface a tabletcumpc bearing microsoft’s own brand</s>
<s>a version of windows 8 for smartphones is due on october 29th</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whether the new era will be a successful one is an open question</s>
<s>it got off to a stumbling start when the european commission warned microsoft not to repeat the sin of steering users away from rivals to its explorer browser</s>
<s>the company insisted all would be well before the launch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what is not in doubt is how much is at stake for microsoft</s>
<s>to see that look at the chart</s>
<s>in its past financial year its windows division accounted for about a quarter of its revenue of $737 billion threequarters of that came from sales of windows to pcmakers for installation on new desk and laptops</s>
<s>windows is the dominant system on such devices with more than 90 of the market despite the growing popularity of apple’s macs</s>
<s>but that market has slowed</s>
<s>in the year to the third quarter shipments of pcs fell by 86 according to idc a research firm</s>
<s>however the drop largely reflected a clearout of stocks by pcsellers before windows 8’s arrival as well as the ropiness of the world economy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>people are doing more and more computing on the go using tablets and smartphones</s>
<s>apple rules the tablet market although devices powered by google’s android operating system have been taking a bigger share</s>
<s>on october 23rd apple unveiled the fourth incarnation of the ipad as well as a smaller version with a screen less than eight inches 20cm across google and amazon had already launched much cheaper seveninch tablets</s>
<s>in smartphones android devices account for most of the volume apple’s iphone scoops most of the profit</s>
<s>windows has a tiny share of smartphones in tablets it is invisible</s>
<s>if you lump these in with pcs says frank gillett of forrester another research company microsoft’s share of personalcomputing devices drops to only 30</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft’s plan has several parts starting with the transformation of windows into a system for touchscreens</s>
<s>“tiles” replace the icons that have cluttered screens since windows 95 appeared 17 years ago</s>
<s>tiles can represent pretty much anything you like from applications to photos of loved ones</s>
<s>they are also “live” showing new information as it comes in</s>
<s>xbox microsoft’s games and homeentertainment hub and existing windows phones already have this look</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>complementarity between devices goes beyond appearances</s>
<s>using microsoft’s cloud services owners of windows 8 devices will be able to start doing something on one machine working in the office say and continue on another finishing a document on the road</s>
<s>they will also be able to play xbox’s music video and games</s>
<s>in effect says josé piñero of microsoft’s entertainment and devices division this stretches xbox’s reach from the 67m consoles sold so far to “hundreds of millions” of devices</s>
<s>through an app called smartglass tablets and phones can become adjuncts to xboxes in the home showing information about a film playing on the screen in the living room</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this distinguishes microsoft from apple</s>
<s>apple’s desk and laptops on the one hand and its iphones and ipads on the other have different operating systems and appearances</s>
<s>microsoft is also more generous than apple to its army of developers on whom it must rely to fill the windows store the online shop for windows 8 apps</s>
<s>apple like google snaffles 30 of all revenue from its store</s>
<s>microsoft will take 30 only of the first $25000 and 20 on the rest</s>
<s>developers may also take payment outside the shop cutting microsoft out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time microsoft is taking a leaf out of apple’s book by making and selling its own devices</s>
<s>hitherto it has supplied the operating system others have made the pcs</s>
<s>although lots of devices will be on offer the surface says tami reller the chief financial officer of the windows division is “the perfect stage for windows 8”</s>
<s>the most basic version costs $499 the same as the cheapest fullsized new ipad another $100 buys a cover containing a keyboard</s>
<s>at least at first the surface will be sold only online or through microsoft’s own bricksandmortar shops</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mark moerdler of sanford c bernstein a research firm says that although windows 8 may sell on pcs it is “a tablet operating system first and foremost”</s>
<s>unlike apple’s and google’s systems he says it has been designed to allow people to create content as well as to consume it</s>
<s>being able to use microsoft’s popular office suite of word document excel spreadsheet and powerpoint slide software on a tablet designed for the purpose should give windows 8 an edge over its competitors</s>
<s>a version will be installed on devices that run windows rt the cheaper less powerful armbased flavour of windows 8 such as the first surfaces</s>
<s>microsoft does not make office for the ipad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft says advance sales have been brisk at $800m by the end of september they were 40 higher than for windows 7 before its launch in 2009</s>
<s>even so there are obstacles</s>
<s>one suggested by some previews is that the new look and feel will take getting used to—though ms reller says that in trials 84 of people got to grips with it within a day</s>
<s>another is that windows 7 has been popular so people may be wary of upgrading</s>
<s>and touchscreen adds about $100 to the cost of a pc reckons kirk yang who covers technology hardware for barclays in hong kong</s>
<s>all this may make consumers hesitate before they buy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>companies are likely to be slower on the uptake than consumers</s>
<s>many have not long switched to windows 7 or are still using windows xp released 11 years ago</s>
<s>they will be in no hurry to invest in touchscreen pcs or to retrain staff to use windows 8</s>
<s>they may however be happy to see their staff using tablets with office</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr gillett at forrester thinks that for all these reasons sales may not really get going until 2014</s>
<s>but he forecasts that by 2016 microsoft will have over a quarter of the tablet market and a fair if smaller share of smartphone operating systems too</s>
<s>the personalcomputing market is shifting fast from deskbound to mobile and from mouseandkeyboard to touch</s>
<s>microsoft had little choice but to go mobile</s>
<s>its chances of success boil down to how much people care about having more or less the same operating system tools and content in the office on the road and on the sofa as well as on the quality of what microsoft has to offer</s>
<s>it is touch and go</s>
