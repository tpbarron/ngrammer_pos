<s>the worlds largest strangest and most remote telescope will be completed in early 2011</s>
<s>the icecube observatory sits deep underneath the south pole and has been built in a cubic kilometre of perfectly clear bubblefree ancient ice</s>
<s>icecube does not record light from distant stars but ghostly particles called neutrinos which can fly from the edge of the universe and even pass right through the earth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with icecube scientists hope to solve the cosmicray puzzle that has plagued them for over a century</s>
<s>cosmic rays bombard the earth from space and include particles of astounding energy 40m times more powerful than anything that physicists can create in the worlds biggest accelerators</s>
<s>but no one knows where they come from because the rays are deflected by stellar magnetic fields and follow a wandering path through space</s>

<p>
<s>highenergy neutrinos could provide the answer</s>
<s>they are created alongside cosmic rays but fly straight</s>
<s>likely sources include the gammaray bursts caused when massive stars explode and briefly shine a million trillion times brighter than our sun</s>
<s>“if we are lucky if we see one neutrino of high energy and we see it at a time of a gammaray burst that is problem solved” explains francis halzen who leads the project from the university of wisconsinmadison</s>

<p>
<s>the observatory is a technological tour de force</s>
<s>it is made up of 86 boreholes 24 kilometres 15 miles deep each containing a string of 60 detectors</s>
<s>they wait for the flash of light that signals the rare occasion when a neutrino hits an ice molecule</s>
<s>so weak is the neutrinos interaction with matter—trillions of them stream through your body every second without effect—that a cubic kilometre of ice is still only enough to spot about ten highenergy neutrinos a year</s>
<s>lowerenergy neutrinos will stream in at a rate of a hundred a day and help tackle another mystery the nature of the “dark matter” that exerts a gravitational pull in space but is made of unknown particles</s>
