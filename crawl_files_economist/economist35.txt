<s>keeping drugs and particularly vaccines potent in tropical climes is a challenge</s>
<s>heat tends to damage them</s>
<s>such medicines have therefore to be moved from one refrigerator to another along what is referred to as a cold chain until they arrive at the clinics where they are to be administered</s>
<s>fridges however are expensive</s>
<s>they also require electricity which is not always available—or is available only unreliably—in the poorer parts of the world</s>
<s>as a consequence breaks in cold chains are estimated by the world health organisation to destroy almost half of the vaccines produced around the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some vaccines can be freezedried which helps</s>
<s>but even when treated in this way their lifetime out of the fridge is limited</s>
<s>ways of keeping drugs and vaccines stable at tropical temperatures would therefore be welcome</s>
<s>and david kaplan of tufts university in massachusetts thinks he has found one</s>
<s>put simply he and his colleagues have worked out how to pack medicines into tiny silk pouches in a manner that makes them almost indifferent to heat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr kaplan and his team describe their technique in a recent issue of proceedings of the national academy of sciences</s>
<s>they start with silkworm cocoons—the raw material for almost all silk production</s>
<s>they boil the cocoons in a solution of sodium carbonate to separate a protein called fibroin which is the one they want from another called sericin which they do not</s>
<s>they treat the fibroin with salt then mix it with the substance to be preserved and spread the result out as films before freezedrying it</s>
<s>the resulting films consist of a fibroin matrix filled with tiny pockets a few hundred nanometres billionths of a metre across</s>
<s>these pockets contain the medicine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>packaging delicate medicines in this way does indeed help preserve them</s>
<s>it immobilises the molecules preventing them from unfolding and thus losing their potency</s>
<s>it also minimises residual moisture even better than normal freezedrying</s>
<s>dr kaplan and his team demonstrated the effectiveness of their new technique by trying it out on the mmr measles mumps and rubella vaccine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>prolonged storage at just 25°c will cause even the freezedried version of mmr to break down</s>
<s>after six months it retains only 6075 of its potency</s>
<s>if kept for that length of time at 45°c extreme but not unknown in the tropics it is practically worthless</s>
<s>when stored using dr kaplan’s silk sheets however it was still about 85 potent after six months regardless of temperature</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the researchers tried the same trick with tetracycline a commonly prescribed antibiotic they got similar results</s>
<s>tetracycline stored at body temperature lost 80 of its potency after four weeks in ordinary solution but lost none when stored in silk films</s>
<s>the new technique also worked with penicillin</s>
<s>moreover fibroin is harmless to people—silk is after all often used in sutures—so there is little risk of adverse sideeffects</s>
<s>it probably does not matter if some silk gets into a vaccine when it is dissolved in water prior to inoculation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said the vaccines and antibiotics stored in this new way have yet to be tested on people</s>
<s>that is the next step</s>
<s>but if they work this new trick will help save lives being needlessly lost in some of the poorest parts of the world</s>
