<s>seven years after it closed its exhibition space in queens the museum for african art will at last move into a new home in the heart of manhattan in late 2012</s>
<s>the first purposebuilt museum to be constructed on the citys “museum mile” since the guggenheim in 1959 the newcomer will be among friends</s>
<s>it stands on the corner of fifth avenue and east 110th street</s>
<s>to the north lies the studio museum in harlem and the schomburg centre for research in black culture part of the new york public library</s>
<s>to the south are el museo del barrio devoted to latino culture the museum of the city of new york the jewish museum and the grand old guggenheim herself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>overlooking central park the new building by robert stern will have cost more than $90m and have an 85foot 26metre atrium with a sweeping wood wall on the south side as well as a suite of exhibition galleries totalling 17000 square feet 1580 square metres on the second floor</s>
<s>“we want it to be warm and embracing” says the director elsie mccabe thompson</s>
<s>“it is oriented north—towards our community—and it truly represents who we are”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>once it is open the organisation aims to transform itself from being a mere museum to becoming an african cultural centre bringing together under one roof 18 other africathemed organisations offering dance theatre and music</s>
<s>chief among these will be afropop worldwide a contemporarymusic programme that is recorded in brooklyn and distributed by public radio international to more than 100 stations across america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>determined from its inception in the mid1980s to devise new ways of looking at african art the museum for african art will open with a wittily named exhibition “new premises”</s>
<s>this will be a retrospective of some of the museums finest early shows</s>
<s>among the most important an exhibition called “artartifact african art in anthropology collections” which was put on in 1988 another in 1998 entitled “baule african artwestern eyes” and a third from 2008 “grass roots african origins of an american art”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the curators of “artartifact” drew on african artefacts in several western anthropological collections but purposely created an installation that forced visitors to regard the exhibits not as ethnographic pieces but as works of art in their own right</s>
<s>similarly “grass roots” used the tradition of basketmaking not to show off a craft so much as to tell a story of black migration tracing the evolution of the coiled basket and the lives of the people who made them across two millennia from the earliest domestication of rice in africa through the history of the atlantic slave trade to the establishment of the rice plantations of the carolinas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the most colourful exhibition will surely be the arrival of “when i last wrote to you about africa” a retrospective covering 40 years work by africas most famous artist the nigerianbased ghanaian sculptor and installationist el anatsui</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>launched in toronto in october 2010 the show brings together the whole range of el anatsuis creativity from his early ceramics to his wooden sculptures and assemblings of driftwood finishing up with the huge shimmering wallhangings—made from the metallic tops of whisky and other bottles—which were the centrepiece of a recent venice biennale</s>
<s>for the new museum for african art they will be literally a wall of fame</s>
