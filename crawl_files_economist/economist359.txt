<s>it took decades for jimmy savile to become a beloved national institution but only a few weeks for his ghost to trash another one</s>
<s>on october 3rd a documentary screened on itv a commercial broadcaster showed interviews with several people who claimed they had been abused as children by savile a hugely popular bbc presenter who had died a year earlier</s>
<s>since then the police have been deluged with further accounts of abuse not all of it allegedly perpetrated by savile</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bbc has been shaken</s>
<s>managers stand accused of ignoring persistent wrongdoing some of which is said to have occurred on bbc premises</s>
<s>a tardy and inept response has thrown an unflattering light on the corporation’s ability to handle a crisis exposed flaws in its bureaucracy and cast doubt on the vigour of its corporate governance</s>
<s>the bbc is fighting both internally and with the government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the casus belli was a groundbreaking investigation by bbc two’s “newsnight” programme into savile’s alleged offences</s>
<s>when this was delivered to peter rippon the programme’s editor in late november 2011 he initially indicated enthusiasm then pulled the film for reasons which remain disputed</s>
<s>one of the journalists who interviewed some of savile’s victims has claimed that the intervention was the result of “a long political chain” of influence in the news division of the bbc</s>
<s>whoever yanked that chain the broadcaster missed its chance to expose savile’s crimes after scant discussion</s>
<s>instead it broadcast a christmas tribute to the late presenter</s>

<p>
<s>george entwistle the bbc’s new directorgeneral has announced two inquiries yet remains under fire</s>
<s>in an uncomfortable appearance before the house of commons culture committee on october 23rd he admitted that in his previous job as “head of vision” running the bbc’s tv arm he had not inquired into the nature of the “newsnight” programme when a senior colleague told him it might disrupt the christmas schedules</s>
<s>nor did he ask why it was never aired</s>
<s>perhaps more hazardous for mr entwistle’s future tenure he failed to probe the matter more thoroughly after he became the boss</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the imbroglio is growing</s>
<s>mark thompson mr entwistle’s predecessor who is due to start a new job as head of the new york times next month is under fire for failing to follow up on the “newsnight” investigation into savile even though one journalist claims to have mentioned the matter to him</s>
<s>mr rippon has—in bbc parlance—already “stepped aside” after inaccuracies were revealed in an account of events posted on his blog</s>
<s>more senior executive scalps could follow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this is reminiscent of another crisis</s>
<s>a furious row over a report claiming that the government had deliberately overstated the case for war in iraq resulted in greg dyke then the bbc’s chief resigning in 2004 after a stinging report by lord hutton a senior judge</s>
<s>bureaucratic rumpcovering and editorial misjudgments have featured prominently in both cases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no broadcaster worth its salt escapes scandals they are the downside of dealing with tricky subjects</s>
<s>but the accretion of layers of management and rival fiefs inside the bbc—described by one news editor as “like the vatican just with more cardinals”—has emerged as a big problem</s>
<s>mr entwistle for instance was loth to pry into decisions which came within the remit of helen boaden the director of news and also a candidate for directorgeneral</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the thick of it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>buckpassing tendencies are not limited to publicly funded broadcasting just look at rupert murdoch’s news international which long failed to admit to phonehacking</s>
<s>the bbc however features an extra complication it relies on the goodwill of governments to maintain a licencefee settlement big enough to pay for its activities</s>
<s>political jostling is thus rarely far away</s>
<s>the culture secretary maria miller has suggested that the bbc trust its governing body should be more robust in pursuing critical inquiries into what has gone wrong</s>
<s>lord patten the trust’s chairman responded by telling the government to get its nose out of the independent broadcaster’s business</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>britons trust the bbc more than any other media outfit</s>
<s>its breadth and the high standard of its best programmes make it a globally envied brand</s>
<s>the sudden revelation of so many flaws has been deeply damaging</s>
<s>the nation’s broadcaster could face longrunning costly claims from victims of abuse</s>
<s>from the height of so much esteem it is a steep fall</s>
