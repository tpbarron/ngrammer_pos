<s>for a decade arcane disputes about sovereignty over islands atolls and sandbanks in the south china sea had seemed back where they belonged in academic seminars and jurists conclaves</s>
<s>in 2010 however these waters again became a centre of attention</s>
<s>china staged naval exercises there</s>
<s>america sent an aircraftcarrier the george washington on a cruise including its first visit to vietnam</s>
<s>and america and china along with some of the southeast asian littoral states argued over the sea</s>
<s>in 2011 those arguments will grow shriller</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>four regional trends intersect in the south china sea</s>
<s>one is the attempt by the obama administration to reassert americas role as an asian power peacekeeper and partner to a number of chinas neighbours</s>
<s>a second is chinas growing assertiveness as a regional power</s>
<s>third is the increasing military muscle it is taking on to back that up</s>
<s>and the fourth is the so far fruitless search for an effective regional forum where disputes could be aired and eventually perhaps even resolved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before going to vietnam the george washington had been off south korea</s>
<s>america showed solid support for the contention by south korea—backed by an international inquiry—that north korea was responsible for the sinking of its naval ship the cheonan in march 2010</s>
<s>this put it at odds with china which refused to finger its old ally and set the scene for a bit of naval muscleflexing by both countries in the seas off the koreas</s>
<s>in 2011 tension will increase further</s>
<s>besides existing differences over the sinking of the cheonan and strategies for persuading north korea to get rid of its nuclear arsenal the two countries will have divergent approaches to the looming succession in north korea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tension may be even more acute over the south china sea</s>
<s>perturbed by chinas position that it regarded the south china sea as a “core” interest—ie on a par with tibet and taiwan—america in july 2010 weighed in to say it too had a “national interest” in freedom of navigation there</s>
<s>this came during the normally bland proceedings of the asean regional forum held in hanoi</s>
<s>it prompted a show of support from nearly half of the 27 countries represented there for americas call for a new approach to disputeresolution</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>besides china and taiwan brunei malaysia the philippines and vietnam have territorial claims in the sea</s>
<s>indonesia too has waters that on chinese maps appear as part of chinas territorial realm</s>
<s>but it is vietnams claim to the paracel islands occupied by china that is most likely to lead to conflict which is why americas chumminess with a traditional chinese rival seemed so provocative</s>
<s>it will become even more so in 2011 as america fleshes out an agreement with vietnam on civilnuclear cooperation</s>
<s>to chinese observers this recalls americas controversial nuclear deal with india and smacks of a containment strategy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china has however provoked the suspicion of its neighbours</s>
<s>its ships treat the sea as a chinese lake</s>
<s>its mysterious maps show chinese sovereignty extending over areas far bigger than would be justified merely by reference to its claim to the paracel and spratly archipelagos</s>
<s>and in 2010 it engaged in stunts such as sending a tiny submarine down more than two miles 3759 metres to be precise to plant a chinese flag on the seabed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chinese naval influence is extending not just deeper but farther from chinas shores</s>
<s>in 2010 sri lanka opened a chinesebuilt port in the south at hambantota</s>
<s>work proceeded on the port at gwadar in pakistan</s>
<s>and chinese warships paid their first call on myanmar</s>
<s>all of this fuelled indian suspicions of a “string of pearls” strategy designed to choke its own maritime breathingspace</s>
<s>it is as part of this broader extension of influence that the south china sea will be a focus of concern</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>time to prepare for a rainy day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that concern will be heightened by two particular aspects of chinas military modernisation</s>
<s>one is an unannounced aircraftcarrier programme</s>
<s>the other of more immediate relevance in 2011 is chinas development of the worlds first antiship ballistic missile which the chinese and some foreign newspapers have touted as a “gamechanging” carrierbuster</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet many american strategists remain convinced that the perception of chinas rapid catchingup with american technological might has outpaced the reality</s>
<s>for some time to come america will remain the regions dominant maritime power</s>
<s>but that does not ensure the peace</s>
<s>that task also demands regional forums that are more than just talkingshops</s>
<s>china has been able to set the terms of the south china sea debate by refusing to discuss the disputes in any other than bilateral meetings</s>
<s>in 2011 it will be more apparent to southeast asia that the region will be better served by multilateral diplomacy and that its interests also demand mechanisms that make it easier to solve its own internal tensions—between indonesia and malaysia for example or cambodia and thailand</s>
<s>the american umbrella still keeps the region safe</s>
<s>but it will not be rainproof for ever</s>
