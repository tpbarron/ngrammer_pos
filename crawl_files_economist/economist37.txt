<s>put aside for a moment the vast costs of the long war in afghanistan against the taliban—in terms of the hundreds of billions of dollars spent and the lives lost since the american invasion in 2001</s>
<s>put aside too the overblown and at times dishonest western claims in the past about the kind of afghanistan that would emerge</s>
<s>the question today is what prospects afghanistan faces and how to realise the best outcome there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>going by the mood in nato capitals and among western voters the war is unwinnable and afghanistan a cesspit of corruption rotten governance ingratitude and violence</s>
<s>the assumption is spreading that after 2014 when foreign troops are to leave the country will inevitably lapse into a bloody civil war destined to bring the taliban storming back into kabul</s>
<s>western politicians as weary of the fighting as the people they represent are tempted to bow to popular sentiment and bring the troops home early</s>
<s>some countries have already pulled out and others will leave in 2013</s>
<s>in washington and london too there is talk of accelerating the pace of the withdrawal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that would be a mistake both because it would jeopardise progress that has been so dearly bought and because it would needlessly imperil what could still be a reasonable transition see article</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>expectations about the future of afghanistan are now hugely diminished and rightly so</s>
<s>yet for all the disappointments the country has made real progress since the taliban were ejected from power 11 years ago</s>
<s>schooling and primary health care are transformed</s>
<s>educated young afghans have broader views and aspirations than their parents</s>
<s>the capital kabul once devastated is now a commercial hub of over 5m</s>
<s>mobile phones and 3g coverage are widespread</s>
<s>the media are free and lively</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from almost nothing a few years ago a 350000strong afghan national security force has been recruited trained and deployed</s>
<s>its needs to improve but afghans are fighting in ninetenths of all operations and leading nearly half of them</s>
<s>the insurgency they face is resilient but predictions of a new civil war are overblown</s>
<s>support for the taliban is limited and its senior leaders tired of fighting</s>
<s>even the taliban recognise that no faction has sufficient military power to prevail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although the security transition is better than many think the prospects for the equally important political one hang in the balance</s>
<s>presidential elections are due in the first half of 2014 in which hamid karzai afghanistan’s leader since 2004 is constitutionally barred from standing</s>
<s>it is vital that afghans see these elections as an improvement on the fraudridden polls in 2009 and 2010</s>
<s>unless they can vote for a president and a government with broad legitimacy greater factionalism and ethnic splits will result—and these are potentially more dangerous to stability even than the taliban</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr karzai and senior afghan politicians bear the greatest responsibility for what happens next</s>
<s>the afghan president has promised not to stand again by trying to rejig the constitution or declaring a state of emergency</s>
<s>he sees himself as an afghan nationalist and wants to be remembered a great hero</s>
<s>but he also has a network of family and friends and a history of putting their interests above the country’s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is important therefore that the next head of the independent election commission iec is not a creature of the karzai court</s>
<s>mr karzai should insist that the outgoing head quickly announces as promised a timetable for the 2014 presidential election</s>
<s>he should work with parliament to agree on a new electoralreform law ready for the 2015 parliamentary elections</s>
<s>he and the iec should set up a new voter register ideally backed up with an electronic id system to combat fraud</s>
<s>lastly mr karzai should refrain from nominating a candidate as his successor</s>
<s>only by standing back completely can he show that the election will be reasonably fair</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hold his feet to the fire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is an ambitious agenda—and more likely to come about if mr karzai is under pressure from abroad</s>
<s>rushing to pull out troops would only squander what remaining influence nato has in afghanistan</s>
<s>instead america should demonstrate its commitment by nailing down the agreement that will govern its diplomatic and security relations with the country after 2014</s>
<s>in addition foreign donors can use the influence they won from the commitments made in tokyo in july to provide aid worth $16 billion up to 2015</s>
<s>the money separately pledged to the security forces must not become a bargaining chip—it was after russia cut off such cash that the government in kabul fell in 1992</s>
<s>even so mr karzai and other afghan leaders should be in no doubt that a stolen election will give weary donors all the excuse they need to cancel their promises</s>
<s>much has gone wrong in afghanistan but enough has gone right for the west to seek to preserve what has been created</s>
