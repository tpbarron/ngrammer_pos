<s>what if america is not doomed to eversharper partisanship</s>
<s>much about this election season lowers moderates’ spirits</s>
<s>yet it also gives grounds to hope that the future will offer greater rewards to pragmatic candidates</s>
<s>one source of optimism lies in an unfashionable place the suburbs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 2012 elections are fierce in part because they are close</s>
<s>between now and november 6th a clutch of knifeedge districts and counties may tip a halfdozen states one way or the other</s>
<s>strikingly often the decisive swing neighbourhoods are suburbs being transformed by such forces as flight from dysfunctional inner cities economic migration and globalisation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>from the counties round denver to the suburbs of philadelphia or northern virginia these swing districts share other traits too</s>
<s>less than a generation ago many used to be reliably republican and overwhelmingly white but are now finely balanced between right and left</s>
<s>some are now among america’s most diverse communities rivalling 19thcentury new york or san francisco for polyglot energy</s>
<s>when quizzed by pollsters suburbanites are not as liberal as city folk but they are less socially conservative than voters in rural or lowdensity exurban areas</s>
<s>they worry about the environment at least when green issues affect their quality of life and—though fiscally flinty—will vote for local taxes to pay for libraries or light railways</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the electoral weight of the america that lies between the cities and the open countryside has been felt for a while</s>
<s>bill clinton wooed soccer moms with a will</s>
<s>george w bush campaigned hard in farflung lowdensity exurbs</s>
<s>in 2012 strategists for both barack obama and mitt romney name such spots as jefferson county near denver the outlying suburbs of philadelphia or the commuter towns of northern virginia as precious reservoirs of undecided voters notably middleaged women with children</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but demographers and political scientists who study the suburbs make a good case that the larger significance of these placesinbetween is being missed</s>
<s>part of that significance is racial</s>
<s>a 20year timelag in the national imagination means suburbs are still seen as white says robert lang of the university of nevada in las vegas</s>
<s>a recent study by the university of minnesota law school found that in 2010 about 50m americans lived in suburbs that are “diverse” meaning between a fifth and threefifths nonwhite a jump of 10m in a decade</s>
<s>another 20m lived in suburbs that are more than 60 nonwhite</s>
<s>nonwhite ’burbs are democratic bastions for the moment but there is nothing inevitable about this</s>
<s>republicans such as jeb bush the former governor of florida urge their party to soften harsh polices towards immigrants and woo pious upwardlymobile hispanics who should be natural conservatives</s>
<s>that argument will be won or lost in fastgrowing latino suburbs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>part of the suburbs’ importance lies in their volatility</s>
<s>mr lang has traced what he calls a “tipping line” across northern virginia marking the boundary of majoritydemocratic territory</s>
<s>when that line advances west of dulles airport near washington democrats win statewide races</s>
<s>this happened in 2008 when mr obama became the first democrat to take virginia in a presidential election since 1964</s>
<s>this year the line has moved back he says and lies right on dulles pointing to a dead heat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>part of the suburban tale involves changing values</s>
<s>tiffanie huntley a romney supporter and mother of six from jefferson county in colorado says that democratic incomers have transformed her area down to local school parents’ associations which seethe with proobama “propaganda”</s>
<s>the county has been “inundated with californians and they have very different values” she complains</s>
<s>the cowboys up in the hills are conservatives but “they don’t vote”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such finely balanced suburban tensions are not all bad for they prod politicians towards bipartisanship</s>
<s>mike fitzpatrick a republican congressman represents a ferociously competitive district outside philadelphia</s>
<s>it runs from strip malls in the south to open country in the north with swing suburbs inbetween</s>
<s>he stresses his record of voting with democrats in favour of environmental rules and praises those who reach across the party divide</s>
<s>his democratic opponent kathy boockvar also tries to straddle partisan divides calling herself progun but prochoice on abortion and echoing republican criticisms of mr obama’s health reforms</s>
<s>on social issues notes terry madonna of franklin  marshall college republicans in the philadelphia suburbs are more liberal than democrats in much of the rest of pennsylvania</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sometimes the government is here to help</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>lastly remember why suburbdwellers flee failing cities</s>
<s>many move for good schools safe streets and nice parks argues lawrence levy of the national centre for suburban studies at hofstra university that is for better public services</s>
<s>they want value for their taxes</s>
<s>but they do not see government as an enemy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>suburbs are not a cureall for division</s>
<s>racial segregation lurks within suburbs that look diverse on paper</s>
<s>the “big sort”—the theory advanced by the writer bill bishop that americans increasingly choose to live near likeminded folk—describes plenty of suburbs</s>
<s>electoral gerrymandering afflicts suburbs as much as other places</s>
<s>but the sorting effects that cause division can be and are disrupted by suburban complexity and churn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is worth recalling that for all the talk of deadlock america is home to enough swing districts to tip whole states from red to blue</s>
<s>a remarkable number of these are found in suburbs whose residents are illserved by the zealots and specialinterest lobbies that hold such sway on both right and left</s>
<s>such voters represent a big part of america’s future</s>
<s>with luck national politicians will not be able to ignore them for ever</s>
