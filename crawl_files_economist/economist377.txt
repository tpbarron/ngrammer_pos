<s>since the start of the financial crisis various writers have tried to explain how it all went wrong</s>
<s>they have had plenty to rant about—from global trade imbalances between east and west to the expansion of “casino” banking in london and wall street</s>
<s>the challenge for these authors has been to concentrate on one aspect of political economy instead of trying to explain everything from british banking to chinese politics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the convoluted title of this book suggests robert peston struggles to focus on one topic</s>
<s>readers are transported to provincial protests in china where local farmers rail against communist officials</s>
<s>they are then treated to a history of the european debt crisis before moving on to the libor scandal surrounding barclays bank</s>
<s>these events are of course related but it is brave to try and cover them all in equal depth in a single volume</s>

<s>mr peston an awardwinning print journalist before he became the business editor of the bbc has many strengths</s>
<s>chief among these are his sources and a terrierlike determination to get the story</s>
<s>when he concentrates in his book on the british banking crisis his access to those at the top and his frontline reporting illuminate his analysis</s>
<s>he is at his best when explaining how the inability to price a seemingly opaque financial product one of bnp paribas’s collateralised debt obligations ushered in the start of economic trouble for us all</s>
<s>he rightly exposes economists and those he calls members of the financial “priesthood” who failed to see the now seemingly obvious problems in the economic system</s>
<s>still his omniscient style is reminiscent of the very men he chastises</s>
<s>mr peston was hardly shouting from the rooftops before northern rock a british bank went bust in 2007 a scoop that won him a journalistic award</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr peston passionately articulates why everyone should be frustrated with the banking sector—and financial globalisation more generally</s>
<s>he cites a number of interesting facts and statistics</s>
<s>a report by a bank of england economist andrew haldane estimates the implicit subsidy british taxpayers provided to banks during the crisis at £57 billion $913 billion an astonishing figure equal to £914 per person</s>
<s>those who are concerned about the deleterious effect of spiralling executive pay in the city are given ammunition in the form of a study by obermatt a consultancy which shows there is no correlation between pay for senior executives and stock performance on the ftse 100</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however readers looking for resolutions to current woes will be disappointed by this book</s>
<s>the author’s ability to decipher what went wrong at british banks does not translate into how to fix them</s>
<s>when he briefly considers how we might “fix this mess” mr peston talks broadly about a movement back to manufacturing and a more balanced economy</s>
<s>this hardly passes as new insight and does not offer much in the way of vision or direction for western policymakers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>like many mr peston sees the need for banks to be reined in so they play a more humble role in society</s>
<s>in order to do this he reckons banks should be shrunk down into a manageable size in line with that of the british economy</s>
<s>four years after the crisis began royal bank of scotland alone still had a balancesheet the same size as britain’s entire output</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for a tale of how the british banks blew up readers will find juicy details</s>
<s>but for those hoping for an analysis of how an imbalanced global economy went haywire or for what needs to be fixed there are better books elsewhere</s>
<s>mr peston’s rigour in explaining the banking collapse falls down when it comes to suggesting solutions</s>
<s>he is not the only one who finds it easier to point out the flaws in a system than to correct them</s>
