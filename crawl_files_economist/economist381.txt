<s>if current trends hold in 2011 china will make and buy more cars than america or the whole of europe</s>
<s>china is not only adding cars it has also become the worlds secondlargest oil consumer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the past three years weve seen the destructive impact of oil</s>
<s>its price soared to almost $150 a barrel in the runup to the worst financial crisis since the great depression and it caused the worst environmental disaster in american history as perhaps 41m barrels of oil flooded unimpeded into the waters of the gulf of mexico over 120 days</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2011 we will learn that the worlds most populous country and one of the worlds smallest countries have a great deal more in common than anyone would have imagined</s>
<s>china and israel have both drawn the conclusion that the electrification of transport is a critical step in moving towards a more sustainable future breaking the inexorable connection between economic growth and oil dependence</s>
<s>that means powering our cars without oil</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>only 2 of chinas population today own cars—80 of them firsttime car buyers—but the market has been growing by almost 50 a year</s>
<s>by 2020 china will rely on costly foreign oil imports for 65 of its needs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the solution in the eyes of the chinese government is to build a nationwide industry around electric vehicles</s>
<s>for china this represents a triple play</s>
<s>first it wants to avoid the vulnerabilities of an economy built on imported oil</s>
<s>second it desperately needs to clean its urban centres of pollutants largely produced by exhaust pipes</s>
<s>and third it sees the opportunity to take a page out of americas 20thcentury playbook making a large domestic automobile industry the cornerstone of global economic leadership</s>
<s>this new type of car powered not by internalcombustion engines but by batteries power electronics and electric motors plays to the strengths china has gained in consumer electronics over the past decades</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the chinese government has set a goal to become the number one producer of electric cars by 2012</s>
<s>when china says it will create a new industry it means exactly that and the world will take notice</s>
<s>in august 2010 the country announced that it had commissioned 16 stateowned enterprises to begin building the electricvehicle industry</s>
<s>these enterprises led by state grid the worlds largest utility which controls 88 of chinas electrical grid also include the leading companies across the automotive energy finance retail and infrastructure industries that are committed to building this framework</s>
<s>hsbc research predicts that chinas share of the global electricvehicle market will grow from 27 in 2010 to 35 by 2020</s>
<s>history shows that when china gets into a leadership position in manufacturing an electric device it tends to hold on to it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the promising land</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>much like china my home country of israel has set a national goal in the words of president shimon peres to make its transport sector “completely free of petroleum” by 2020</s>
<s>in 2011 with the support of the government the country will implement the worlds first nationwide batteryswitching and vehiclecharging network</s>
<s>the infrastructure allows drivers to switch depleted batteries for full ones in less time than refuelling with gasoline</s>
<s>as a result electric cars no longer require drivers to buy expensive batteries or to worry about limited driving distance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>after nearly three years of development testing and trials by my company and in partnership with renault history is being made as people are able to drive electric cars throughout the entire country with guaranteed mobility zero oil use and zero exhaust emissions</s>
<s>the total cost of implementing such a nationwide network in israel is equal to less than seven days of fuel use by current petrolengine cars in the country</s>
<s>that amazingly small number holds true in most countries around the world—china included</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what can these two countries teach us</s>
<s>there is a way to disconnect economic growth from everdeepening oil dependence</s>
<s>the choice need not be between exporting more dollars to import more barrels or drilling ever deeper and more dangerously into our precious coastal waters</s>
<s>moving the transport sector to reliance on electrons—with an open menu of electricity sources and a massive distributed storage of car batteries to improve the grid and allow higher reliance on renewable sources—can build industries create jobs and improve economic environmental and national security all at once</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all eyes will be on china and israel in 2011 as they become the first countries to take meaningful steps towards reducing oil dependence by the electrification of transport</s>
<s>their success could point the way proving that political will and leadership can combine to create a cleaner future</s>
