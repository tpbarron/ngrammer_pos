<s>it took biologists until 2010 to prove that asian elephants can run they do so with the front legs the hind ones merely walk quickly to keep up</s>
<s>in 2011 economists may conclude something similar about indias elephantine economy</s>
<s>its celebrated parts some services telecoms outsourcing technology trot along nicely enough energetically pulling the whole body forwards but at the back heavy industry agriculture textiles too much merely lumbers</s>

<s>better infrastructure could perhaps boost the economy by a couple more percentage points—delivering longdreamedof doubledigit annual growth and millions more jobs</s>

<s>a revolution spreading mobile telephony will begin to morph into an internet one as firms launch mobile 3g networks early in the year they need revenue soon having dished out over $14 billion on the necessary radio spectrum in 2010</s>
<s>as a result millions of ordinary indians will get online cheaply for the first time in 2011</s>
<s>other private providers of infrastructure should also do well</s>
<s>lowcost airlines prosper by letting travellers avoid jammed roads and railways</s>
<s>for millions of commuters with no choice at least there is the promise of big shiny new railway stations to be built in larger cities</s>

<s>yet the country has big problems to live down</s>
<s>the commonwealth games in delhi late in 2010 were supposed to show off new stadiums and roads but were instead plagued by bad building corruption sloppy contractors and astonishing waste</s>
<s>as india opens up for more trade—not least because 2011 should see a freetrade deal signed with the european union and maybe others—it needs to get the basics right</s>

<s>in farming the country could export more fruit and vegetables to feed the world it grows more of these than almost anyone but far too many of these crops rot for lack of coldstorage and distribution networks</s>
<s>big seaports are jammed up it takes an average of over 90 hours to get through them nearly ten times more than in hong kong</s>
<s>the roads are also clogged congestion may cost the economy $6 billion a year</s>
<s>only half the national road network is even paved</s>
<s>though the government will repeat its promise of building 20km 12 miles of new roads each day the builders wont manage to keep up with booming demand for road space</s>
<s>fine talk of cutting deals with private partners to finance and build roads including toll roads will deliver little until firms believe they will turn a profit</s>
