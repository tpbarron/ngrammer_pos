<s>the old maxim “it’s lonely at the top” is about to become doubly true for mike beebe the governor of arkansas</s>
<s>for one thing pat mccrory’s victory in north carolina leaves mr beebe as the only democratic governor in the south</s>
<s>mr mccrory a republican former mayor of charlotte defeated walter dalton the state’s lieutenantgovernor to become north carolina’s first republican governor in 20 years after bev perdue the unpopular and beleaguered incumbent decided to retire rather than run for reelection</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>closer to home for mr beebe democrats lost control of both houses of arkansas’s state legislature for the first time since reconstruction</s>
<s>he becomes the first democratic governor in modern arkansas history to rule without a legislative majority just as mr mccrory will become the first republican governor in modern north carolina history to rule with one</s>
<s>the south was once almost entirely democratic now a republican takeover at state level is almost complete</s>
<s>except for the kentucky house of representatives which democrats control and the tied virginia state senate republicans hold every legislative chamber in the south</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this was not 2010 when republicans scored unprecedented victories taking a record 720 seats in state legislatures across the country and seizing 20 legislative chambers and 11 governorships from democrats</s>
<s>but it was not a bad night for them</s>
<s>they took control of alaska’s and wisconsin’s formerly split legislatures and gained a supermajority in north carolina’s state house of representatives while losing one in the texas house</s>
<s>they successfully defended the indiana and ohio houses which they won in 2010</s>
<s>jack dalrymple and gary herbert the republican incumbent governors of north dakota and utah handily defeated their democratic challengers</s>
<s>term limits prevented mitch daniels indiana’s popular republican governor from seeking reelection but mike pence a republican congressman kept the seat red</s>
<s>they hoped to pick up governors seats in montana and washington but lost in the former the latter remained uncalled as the economist went to press</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>democrats meanwhile managed to reverse some republican gains of two years ago</s>
<s>they took back both chambers in minnesota and maine which republicans won in 2010</s>
<s>they won lower chambers in oregon and colorado as well as the new york state senate giving them full legislative control in all three states</s>
<s>democrats also unexpectedly won supermajorities in both houses of the california legislature california like oregon colorado and new york has a democratic governor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>elsewhere democrats defended well</s>
<s>they kept majorities in chambers republicans thought they could win—senates in iowa and colorado and houses in new mexico and kentucky—and held off by one seat a republican supermajority in the georgia house</s>
<s>peter shumlin and jack markell easily retained their governorships in deep blue vermont and delaware while jay nixon and earl ray tomblin pulled off the much harder task of doing the same in missouri and west virginia both of which awarded their electoralcollege votes to mitt romney</s>
