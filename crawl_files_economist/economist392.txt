<s>democracy matters</s>
<s>every issue of this newspaper bulges with news about elections held somewhere around the world this issue bulges more than most</s>
<s>for economists however the question of why individuals turn out to vote in places where it is not compulsory remains something of a mystery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>early work on the subject looked at the motivations of rational utilitymaximising homo economicus</s>
<s>voting can bring rewards to individuals in the shape of a government that keeps its favourable election promises</s>
<s>but the benefits of voting must be weighed against the chances of influencing the result</s>
<s>and the probability that a single vote is pivotal to deciding an election is in practical terms zero</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even the closest american presidential election is unlikely to be decided by a single vote</s>
<s>the chances are higher that you will be struck by lightning on the way to the polls</s>
<s>in a very tight race like the one in 2000 the courts will probably determine the outcome</s>
<s>in britain’s parliamentary system a single vote might just deliver a singleseat majority but that would not bring a stable government capable of fulfilling its preelection promises</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by this reckoning the costs of voting however slight always outweigh any benefits</s>
<s>the time and hassle involved in getting to polling stations registering to vote or even deciding between the candidates mean that rational individuals should take a free ride on the efforts of others and stay at home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet what the argument runs if everyone thought like that</s>
<s>it would make sense to vote if everyone else stays away</s>
<s>but it doesn’t take a gametheory expert to work out that others will have the same insight and make it to the polling station too</s>
<s>other theories suggest that people turn out to “preserve democracy”</s>
<s>again it is very unlikely that any one individual staying at home will prove the decisive trigger in democracy’s collapse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more recent theorists have suggested that voting confers the “psychic benefits” also known as a feeling of wellbeing of performing a civic duty</s>
<s>but the argument that people do something because they like it is hardly an illuminating insight</s>
<s>some academics reckon that voters are simply bad at calculating probabilities</s>
<s>others produce reams of equations to back up complicated theories involving the social benefits of group membership</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the mature democracies of the rich world there may be a simpler explanation like agonising over loose change the costs of voting are so tiddly that it is easier just to go and do it than to fret about whether it is rational or not</s>
<s>it would be odd if something as important as democracy were safeguarded by a lack of thought</s>
