</p>

<p>
<s>raw materials come from one place and are processed into active ingredients in another</s>

<s>manufacturing and packaging may be separate</s>
<s>to reach the dispensary the drug passes through distribution chains and may be repackaged</s>
<s>in america 80 of drugs’ active ingredients come from abroad drug imports there more than doubled from 2002 to 2010 accounting for 40 of finished medicine</s>

<p>
<s>for years governments and companies have talked about “trackandtrace” systems to identify and authenticate medicines</s>

<p>
<s>my pills not yours</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so individual states are taking their own steps</s>
<s>nigeria has spearheaded an impressive counterattack which by some counts has brought the share of fake medicines down from around half to a tenth in five years</s>
<s>one means is truscan a cheap handheld spectroscope that allows officials to spot fakes at the point of import america germany sweden and canada now use this too</s>
