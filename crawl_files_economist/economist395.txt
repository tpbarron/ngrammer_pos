<s>at the the main public hospital in thane north of mumbai nisha raut’s doctors say she could have lost her first baby had she given birth at home</s>
<s>ms raut had undergone an emergency caesarean section a day earlier after her son’s pulse fell by threequarters</s>

<s>ms raut is a beneficiary of janani suraksha yojana jsy</s>
<s>launched in 2005 the scheme pays women to give birth in hospital</s>
<s>women below the poverty line or living in ten badly performing states get up to 1400 rupees $26</s>
<s>they get 500 rupees for a home birth with a nurse</s>

<s>almost 11m women qualified last year one reason for india’s improving record on maternal health</s>
<s>in 200508 hospital births more than doubled to 55 of all births says a un study of five big states</s>
<s>meanwhile india’s maternal mortality dropped from 280 deaths per 100000 live births in 2005 to 200 in 2010</s>
<s>india has an infantmortality rate of 47 deaths per 1000 live births which though falling is higher than that of nearly all its neighbours</s>

<s>jsy is a “conditional cashtransfer” scheme paying people to change their behaviour</s>
<s>another scheme rewards poor women who attend prenatal checkups and immunise their babies</s>
<s>a further pilot project seeks to redress india’s skewed gender ratio by giving handouts to families who have daughters and send them to school</s>

<s>india’s public services are not always able to cope with new schemes</s>
<s>because of jsy says rb</s>
<s>kulkarni thane’s chief doctor “the wards are overflowing”</s>
<s>in ms raut’s tenbed maternity ward five extra mattresses are laid out on the floor</s>
<s>jsy funds could better be used to do up hospitals doctors say especially as many patients see the handout merely as a bonus</s>
<s>delayed or looted handouts pose another problem though on a far tinier scale than that observed in welfare schemes that distribute food</s>
<s>a 2011 study of jsy in eight states found that almost no new mothers got their cheque on time and only 85 were ever paid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the main concern is that these schemes change shortterm behaviour but not longterm attitudes</s>
<s>for instance when girls reach 18 there are fears that their windfall will simply go towards their dowry</s>
<s>many jsy women give their cash to a man</s>
<s>“my husband will be in charge of the money” ms raut says of her 600 rupees</s>
<s>“but i’m sure he will spend it on his wife and child”</s>
