<s>the worlds auto industry will suffer a fourth year of poor sales in 2011</s>
<s>for several struggling carmakers this will be especially unwelcome</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>global sales of cars buses and trucks peaked along with the american economy in 2007</s>
<s>just over 714m vehicles were sold that year or nearly 200000 a day</s>
<s>as most of the worlds big economies withered the following year the market shrank by more than 6 a rate of decline not seen for decades</s>
<s>sales dropped even further in 2009 despite government bailouts and subsidies for newcar buyers</s>
<s>with the economic climate improving volumes bounced back in 2010 although they remained 5 below the peak</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the decline and recovery were very uneven</s>
<s>sales plummeted in america to levels last seen in the early 1970s—almost 40 below their highest point</s>
<s>in europe the largest regional market demand dropped steadily cushioned by government subsidies sliding by 15</s>
<s>in contrast sales in india clattered along and those in china boomed doubling between 2007 and 2010 to make it the largest auto market in the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite industry expectations for a sustained recovery the outlook for 2011 has clouded</s>
<s>american demand will rise only slightly if at all</s>
<s>with the housing market still in the doldrums and cashforclunker subsidies at an end consumers will be wary about buying bigticket items</s>
<s>sales in japan will dip again reflecting the countrys comatose economy</s>
<s>in europe without subsidies and with government spending cuts due to come into force demand will fall further</s>
<s>and although sales will rise in china the pace will slow</s>
<s>the economy which has been fuelled by huge government cash injections as well as by property and stockmarket bubbles will cool</s>
<s>demand for cars will grow in other developing countries such as india but their volumes are not enough to make up the shortfall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this fall in global sales spells trouble for some of the worlds auto giants</s>
<s>in america gm and chrysler which have received large government handouts face particular problems</s>
<s>although they have shed billions of dollars in debt and tens of thousands of employees they remain financially weak with tattered reputations</s>
<s>they were counting on a sustained bounceback which has not happened</s>
<s>in europe gms subsidiary opel will find itself on a bumpy road again</s>
<s>with a declining market no chance of government support and a cashstrapped parent it faces tough choices</s>
<s>saab already a shadow of what it once was and now owned by spyker of the netherlands will shrivel</s>
<s>italys fiat will also find 2011 hard going as it gets held back by its chrysler alliance and weak domestic sales</s>
<s>volvo will struggle too in its first full year under chinese ownership</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for other carmakers the troubles of these weaker firms will come as welcome news</s>
<s>the industry has been burdened with at least 50 too much capacity for years</s>
<s>despite the developedmarket slump since 2007 almost no big car plants have been closed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dont cry for me ford cortina</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that comfort will be shortlived however because even the healthier carmakers face a host of other difficulties</s>
<s>input prices will rise and new emissions regulations will require additional rd spending</s>
<s>fuel and vehicle taxes will go up in many places</s>
<s>consumers in america and europe will become more priceconscious buying smaller cheaper cars instead of profitable hunksonwheels</s>
<s>sooner or later rising interest rates will accelerate the trend</s>
<s>luxury carmakers will see their sales divide—surging in developing markets and sinking in developed ones</s>
<s>the rise of domestic firms in china and india will also challenge western manufacturers eroding one of their few sources of growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with lower sales and higher costs carmakers will have to raise prices the last thing they need at a time of weak demand</s>
<s>for consumers who have seen the real costs of motoring fall for more than two decades this will reverse a trend they have become overly used to</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it will be easy to feel sorry for the worlds carmakers in 2011</s>
<s>there will be thousands more layoffs wailing headlines and much wringing of hands especially in government offices in america and europe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but spare the tissues</s>
<s>most of the industrys troubles are selfinflicted</s>
<s>carmakers flooded the market with unprofitable cars in the good times in an effort to stave off the closure of uneconomic factories</s>
<s>they compensated by squeezing suppliers and dealers to the edge of bankruptcy and through creative financing schemes</s>
<s>when times got tough they looked to governments to provide another cushion through subsidies</s>
<s>without the recovery they were banking on the fallout from such folly will become clear in 2011</s>
