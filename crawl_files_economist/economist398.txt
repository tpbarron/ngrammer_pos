<s>in a futuristic art gallery which carlos slim opened last year in mexico city visitors can enjoy among other things a hall of rare coins and share certificates</s>
<s>sometimes art speaks louder than words</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr slim is the richest man in the world</s>
<s>according to forbes he and his family have amassed a comfortable nest egg of $63 billion</s>
<s>bill gates would be richer had he given away less of his stash or mr slim more of his</s>
<s> in mexico mr slim is a giant his companies account for more than a third of the stockmarket</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the slim fortune was made in telephony</s>
<s>after growing moderately rich from property mining and other businesses mr slim the son of a lebanese immigrant named salim bought telmex mexicos staterun telephone monopoly in 1990</s>
<s>telmex still has 80 of mexicos landlines and about 75 of its broadband connections</s>
<s>telcel its sister company has 70 of the mobile market</s>
<s>both now belong to américa móvil a slim venture which has spread across 18 countries in the americas and is the biggest or secondbiggest player in all but three</s>
<s>with nearly 250m subscribers it is the worlds thirdbiggest mobilephone company and accounts for about 60 of mr slims wealth according to forbes</s>
<s>much the biggest market for américa móvil is mexico where profit margins in the stifled mobile sector are among the highest in the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mexicans complain that it is impossible to pass a day without putting pesos into mr slims pockets</s>
<s>his interests span retail banking construction and much else including an 8 stake in the new york times</s>
<s>but one huge market eludes him</s>
<s>under the terms of his telmex concession he forfeited the right to enter mexicos paytelevision business</s>
<s>so whereas américa móvil offers “triple play” packages of phone internet and television nearly everywhere else in latin america in his biggest market mr slim is tuned out from tv</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for many years he has tried to chip away at this ban just as his rivals have tried to loosen his grip on telephones</s>
<s>neither has succeeded</s>
<s>mexicos regulators have found it hard to enforce competition in either market thanks to a blizzard of writs</s>
<s>between 2005 and 2010 the telecoms sector generated more than 260 applications for injunctions judgments of annulment and judicial reviews says a report published on january 30th by the oecd a group of mainly rich countries which includes mexico</s>
<s>the “relentless use of injunctions in particular by américa móvil…has replaced to a large extent the right and responsibility of government to implement economic policy and regulation” it says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this has cost mexico dearly</s>
<s>though it is one of latin americas richest countries mobilephone penetration stands at 88 among the lowest rates in the continent</s>
<s>in brazil a poorer country it is 119 ie it has more mobile phones than people</s>
<s>prices for customers who make few calls and pay in advance are reasonable</s>
<s>but chattier customers pay more than in many rich countries</s>
<s>fast broadband is scarce and pricey see chart</s>
<s>the oecd calculates that excessive pricing in mexicos “dysfunctional” telephone and broadband markets has cost the country some $26 billion a year in purchasingpower parity terms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cost to business of slow and patchy internet connections was not included but is clearly huge</s>
<s>complaints of downtime and blackouts abound on apestancom roughly “theystinkcom” a consumerrage website on which telcel and telmex attract more complaints than any other company in mexico</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are signs that mr slims grip on mexican telephones is being prised open</s>
<s>in april mexicos federal competition commission cfc hit telcel with a fine of $1 billion the biggest it had ever handed out for abusing its dominant position by charging high fees to rivals for connecting calls</s>
<s>telcel is appealing and has yet to pay up</s>
<s>a new competition law has beefed up penalties for antitrust offenders with prison terms of up to ten years for collusion</s>
<s>mr slim has not been accused of this</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a few weeks later the supreme court ruled that telecoms rules should continue to apply while they were being challenged in court</s>
<s>this is normal elsewhere but in mexico regulatory decisions have been suspended for years while judges puzzle over challenges by mr slim and others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>armed with these new powers the telephone regulator cofetel has at last succeeded in drastically reducing telephone interconnection fees</s>
<s>as long as these fees are high “offnet” calls will be more costly than the “onnet” calls made to phones on the same network</s>
<s>this provides consumers with a powerful incentive to join the operator to which most of their friends belong—which in mexico nearly always means telcel</s>
<s>in march cofetel ordered that interconnection fees be reduced from 095 pesos $008 to 039 pesos taking mexico from a relatively high rate to one of the lowest in the oecd</s>
<s>retail prices have already fallen telcel cut the price of its offnet calls by twothirds and telefónica by half</s>
<s>telmex lowered the price of calls to mobiles thereby probably reducing the national inflation rate</s>
<s>the cuts may not end there cofetel is considering applying “asymmetric regulation” to américa móvil which could force it to charge less to its rivals than they charge it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>américa móvil is furious</s>
<s>carlos garcía moreno its chief financial officer warns that the cut will deter operators from covering poor rural areas where customers tend to receive more calls than they make</s>
<s>he points out that in most of europe fees started to drop only when penetration had reached 100</s>
<s>but no oecd country has an incumbent with a market share like that of telcel notes agustín díazpinés an economist at the oecd</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr slim has annoyed foreigners too</s>
<s>every year americans make more than 20000 years of calls to mexico more than to all of western europe</s>
<s>in 2004 america won a case against mexico at the world trade organisation over mexicos failure to stop telmex from overcharging american companies to dial into the country</s>
<s>comptel an american business association has accused telmex of not consolidating local area codes so local calls are charged as longdistance and of inserting recorded messages into calls from rival carriers warning that future calls might fail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>technological change could squeeze mr slim</s>
<s>telephone calls and tv are increasingly delivered through the same cable</s>
<s>since 2007 cable companies in mexico have offered bundled services of phone internet and television which américa móvil may not do</s>
<s>a quarter of fixedbroadband customers now get online via cable</s>
<s>and as mexicos middle class expands the broadband market is growing by a quarter each year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>wireless broadband is another threat to mr slim</s>
<s>in 2010 an auction of new spectrum allowed his mobile competitors to offer 3g mobiledata services</s>
<s>televisa the biggest paytv company which is controlled by the azcárraga family is trying to add mobile telephony to its products</s>
<s>its proposal to buy half of iusacell a small mobile operator was blocked by the cfc on the ground that the other half of the company is owned by tv azteca televisas main rival in television</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new technology offers mr slim opportunities too it could allow him to invade televisas turf</s>
<s>freetoair television in mexico is a stale duopoly in which 70 of viewers tune in to channels broadcast by televisa the biggest media company in the spanishspeaking world</s>
<s>televisa dominates paytv as well with about 45 of mexicos cable market and 60 of the satellite market</s>
<s>according to the cfc more competition in the paytv sector could slash prices and increase the size of the market by more than a third</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>telmex is hammering on the door</s>
<s>in october it cheekily transmitted live footage of the pan american games via its website</s>
<s>rivals cried foul but so far there has been no sanction</s>
<s>in 2008 mr slim engineered a deal with dish a satellitetv firm whereby telmex would provide billing services for the broadcaster and sell its packages in its shops</s>
<s>again rivals have complained to no avail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the partnership has been successful</s>
<s>in its first two years dish won 2m customers equal to nearly 40 of the satellite market and about 17 of the entire paytv market</s>
<s>its cheapest deal is 109 pesos a month less than half the cost of the cheapest package with sky mexico the market leader which is majorityowned by televisa</s>
<s>paytv could be even bigger more mexican homes have tvs than fridges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>next mr slim craves a broadcast licence of his own perhaps when mexico switches to digital television freeing up enough spectrum for at least two new national freetoair channels</s>
<s>in 2010 felipe calderón the president issued a decree bringing forward the digital switchover from 2021 to 2015</s>
<s>the decree was suspended after complaints by incumbentfriendly senators</s>
<s>cofetel said that it would move ahead with an auction of two new channels</s>
<s>but on january 25th it announced without explanation that it had decided to suspend the project indefinitely</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the big prize for mr slim would be a change in the rules to allow him to use his vast network of phone lines to deliver television</s>
<s>the copper lines would need to be upgraded to fibre a project which telmex has already begun to provide faster broadband</s>
<s>cabletv companies fret that mr slim will crush them he already has 144m fixedline phone customers whereas their cables are only in 55m homes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two things hold mr slim back</s>
<s>one is that with a general election due on july 1st few politicians dare irk the incumbent broadcasters</s>
<s>in 2008 santiago creel a senator who had argued for more competition in television was blurred out in televisas coverage of a senate debate</s>
<s>televisa blamed an “editing error”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a source says the presidency leant on the cfc unsuccessfully in the end to approve televisas proposed acquisition of half of iusacell</s>
<s>cofetels announcement that it would shelve plans to auction new freetoair tv channels was seen by some as a sop to the giant broadcaster</s>
<s>a common saying in the industry is that mexicos phone sector may be about four times more valuable than the television market but the latter is four times as powerful</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr slims second weakness is content</s>
<s>unsurprisingly televisa and tv azteca are unwilling to sell their programmes to paytv rivals such as dish and there is no rule forcing them to</s>
<s>televisas “channel of the stars” pumps out wildly popular telenovelas such as “abyss of passion” and “hope of the heart” to which families tune in religiously</s>
<s>though they are also broadcast on freetoair television many prefer to watch them via cable or satellite as the signal is much better</s>
<s>about 40 of time spent watching paytv is reckoned to be spent watching free channels</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so mr slim would have to woo audiences not just with low prices but with good mexican programming imported argentine telenovelas with their funny accents wont do</s>
<s>it would in short mean fierce competition something that for mexicos strangled tv and telecoms markets cannot come soon enough</s>
