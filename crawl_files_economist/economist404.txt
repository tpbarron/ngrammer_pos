<s>rainy days are rarely welcome</s>
<s>but in america where more than 850 communities rely on ageing sewer systems a downpour can be especially bleak</s>
<s>these cities collect stormwater and sewage in the same pipes which means that when sewers are overwhelmed raw sewage floods directly into rivers and streams</s>
<s>new york city for example spills 520m gallons 2 billion litres of sewage into waterways each week on average according to riverkeeper a local advocacy group</s>
<s>as pipes erode the problem gets worse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the federal environmental protection agency epa has ordered a number of cities to upgrade their treatment of stormwater</s>
<s>the typical solution is for a city to build larger pipes and a giant underground tank to hold the excess water until sewers can handle the flow</s>
<s>but this is often expensive and ineffective</s>
<s>milwaukee for example has spent around $4 billion over two decades on stormwater management but still dumps billions of gallons of sewage into lake michigan every year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in order to meet the epas cleanwater standards philadelphia would need to spend an estimated $8 billion on a new underground tank</s>
<s>but the cashpoor city has crafted a less expensive and potentially far more beneficial scheme which may set a new precedent for urban stormwater management</s>
<s>called “green city clean waters” the plan outlines a comprehensive $16 billion 20year investment in green infrastructure—everything from “green roofs” covered with vegetation to streetedge gardens—to keep excess water from entering sewers in the first place</s>
<s>the epa has yet to give the proposal a green light but city officials hope that they can move forward with the plan in 2011</s>

<p>
<s>though philadelphias plan is the most ambitious to date the greeninfrastructure trend has finally taken root in north america after decades of progress in europe</s>
<s>new york for example has run a number of pilot programmes around the city involving everything from rain barrels to porous sidewalks and hopes to produce a comprehensive citywide infrastructure plan in 2011</s>
<s>other cities such as milwaukee chicago and seattle are initiating more incentives for residents and businessowners to manage water on their own property</s>
<s>in 2010 toronto became the first north american city to require green roofs on parts of all new developments with more than 2000 square metres of gross floor area come january 2011 the bylaw will apply to new industrial projects as well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>research into green infrastructure has shown that it not only helps cities handle their runoff problems but also helps to cool and cleanse urban air cut energy costs reduce asthma and create new jobs</s>
<s>as philadelphia awaits the epas verdict other big cities will be watching too</s>
