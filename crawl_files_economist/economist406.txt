<s>americas long history in space and its space budget of almost $18 billion a year mean that the activities of its space agency nasa usually dwarf those of rivals</s>
<s>yet other nations are increasingly making their presence felt in space—and this will be especially true in 2011 of china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although much has been made of chinese lunar ambitions a second chinese probe will be launched in 2011 it is its activities in low earth orbit and around mars that will be more interesting</s>
<s>towards the end of 2010 china was discovered to have been secretly testing orbital rendezvous technologies</s>
<s>this was almost certainly in preparation for its threespacecraft space station</s>
<s>the first module a laboratory called tiangong 1 will lift off in 2011 doubtless to national acclaim</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china wants the station to show off its prowess to both domestic and international audiences</s>
<s>it also wants to collaborate with the americans on the international space station having so far been rebuffed china has decided to build its own station</s>
<s>once operational it will be hard for the americans to ignore</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it will be an exciting year for missions to mars and its moon phobos</s>
<s>the americans will launch the mars science laboratory in late 2011 or early 2012</s>
<s>the mission will see another “rover” land on mars this one bigger and smarter than previous rovers</s>
<s>it will analyse soil and rock samples looking for organic materials and asking whether mars ever was or is currently capable of supporting microbial life</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the russians are heading for phobos in late 2011 or early 2012</s>
<s>their phobosgrunt mission will be the first to land on this strange moon and with luck it will return to earth with samples of phobos</s>
<s>scientists would like to know if phobos is a captured asteroid or formed in orbit and whether it had or has water</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chinas first planetary probe the tiny yinghuo 1 orbiter will also hitch a ride to mars with phobosgrunt</s>
<s>this will be a test of chinas ability to handle deep space missions</s>
<s>but yinghuo 1 will also be exploring the upper atmosphere of mars—aiming to discover why water vanished from the red planet</s>
<s>yinghuo 1 will work in tandem with the russian probe and it carries a camera for “public outreach”</s>
<s>with mars express the european space agencys craft also passing close to phobos in 2011 all this interest in a previously obscure moon will lead to speculation about human missions there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a high point will come on march 18th at 1245am utc coordinated universal time when nasas messenger spacecraft will insert itself into orbit around the planet mercury</s>
<s>the closest planet to the sun mercury is the earths least explored planetary neighbour</s>
<s>messenger will become the first spacecraft to orbit mercury and the first mission there since mariner 10 in 1975</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>messenger will explore the surface of mercury its crust its atmosphere and even its magnetic field</s>
<s>it will clear up questions about its curiously high density whether it has ice at its poles and where its atmosphere comes from</s>
<s>in other parts of the solar system nasas robotic spacecraft dawn begins exploring the asteroid vesta in order to find out more about the origins of the solar system and a mission to jupiter will be launched</s>

<p>
<s>president barack obamas plan for space exploration sets a new path for nasa</s>
<s>it asks the space agency to focus on privatesector transport to the space station and longdistance human missions</s>
<s>congress fought bitterly over this but a compromise reached in late 2010 will see the shuttle end in 2011 later than planned and the development of a new heavylift rocket</s>
<s>nasa will not return humans to the moon but might visit an asteroid—and much later mars</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is also new money to encourage commercial crew and cargo services to the space station</s>
<s>the private sector is already making good progress in space spacex a company that is aiming to carry both men and vehicles into space expects to grow by 2550 over the next few years</s>
<s>in 2011 spacex will dock the first privately developed spacecraft with the space station</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and in 2011 the spaceship company will start the worlds first spaceship production line—making the craft needed by virgin galactic to take tourists on suborbital flights</s>
<s>back in 2001 the late sciencefiction writer arthur c clarke predicted that by 2012 “aerospace planes” would enter into commercial service</s>
<s>if one accepts that virgins combination of plane and spacecraft qualifies then clarke could posthumously prove to be right</s>
