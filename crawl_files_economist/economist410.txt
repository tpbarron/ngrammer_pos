<s>a mandatory national minimum adult hourly wage of £360 was introduced in april 1999 and has been regularly uprated since</s>
<s>in october it rose to £619</s>
<s>the wage floor seems not to have cost jobs</s>
<s>a 2010 paper by researchers at the centre for economic performance at the london school of economics found the longrun effect was either negligible or positive ie jobs increased</s>
<s>that finding is echoed in studies of minimum wages in america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such results might seem puzzling</s>
<s>if the price of something is forced upwards demand for it should fall</s>
<s>why might this not be the case for lowpaid workers</s>
<s>the answer is that firms find other ways to absorb higher wage costs</s>
<s>the simplest is to raise prices</s>
<s>fastfood restaurants in new jersey did so when the state’s minimum wage was raised in 1992 according to a landmark study by david card and alan krueger of princeton university</s>
<s>firms may also skimp on nonwage benefits trim the number of hours worked by lowpaid staff or cut other costs</s>
<s>even the bestrun firms can find savings when pushed</s>

<s>wage floors in america are low by european standards</s>
<s>britain’s minimum wage is carefully set to avoid demolishing jobs</s>
<s>when it was introduced it affected fewer than 2m workers</s>
<s>but the national living wage is 20 higher the london rate almost 40 higher</s>
<s>if applied to all those currently in work they would raise the pay of around 5m employees</s>
<s>it is hard to believe that would have no effect on jobs</s>

<p>
<s>indeed large cuts in real wages help explain why the jobs market has hummed along in an otherwise sluggish economy</s>
<s>employment growth has been stronger in lowpaid industries—in shops hotels bars office services and so on—than in higherpaid work see chart</s>
<s>the law firms banks and accountants who have embraced the living wage can afford it as they employ few lowpaid workers</s>

<p>
<s>a living wage implies a wage level that keeps up with prices at least in part</s>
<s>but british workers have had to settle for a lower standard of living in recent years because of a weaker pound the rising cost of oil across the world and higher taxes</s>
<s>as a result surprisingly few have lost their jobs</s>
<s>brits it seems much prefer the hardship of low wages to the misery of no wages</s>
