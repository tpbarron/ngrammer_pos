<s>australians will start 2011 with a quite different frame of mind from the one that greeted 2010</s>
<s>back then it seemed that nothing could shake a sense of stability and confidence that came from surviving the global downturn without recession</s>
<s>that came unstuck when political turbulence uncharacteristically rocked the lucky country an election left it with a hung federal parliament and the first minority government in 70 years</s>
<s>for julia gillard the labor prime minister that means 2011 will be riddled with problems simply keeping in power a government that depends on support from independents and greens</s>

<s>these resourcerich states barely noticed the downturn</s>
<s>even so the federal government stepped in with a stimulus package that helped to keep the economy afloat by throwing money at building projects</s>
<s>but the coming year will mark the return of growth in privatesector spending as the economys big driving force</s>
<s>businesses will spend about a$123 billion $122 billion over the financial year to mid2011 a quarter more than in the previous year</s>
