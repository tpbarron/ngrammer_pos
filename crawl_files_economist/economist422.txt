<s>the old pier in hastings a sussex seaside town about 50 miles from london is hardly a hopeful sight for daytrippers</s>
<s>grey waves batter at the blackened burntout structure</s>
<s>the pier which once hosted concerts by artists including the rolling stones closed in 2006</s>
<s>in 2010 it was all but destroyed by fire</s>
<s>a replacement is planned but not everyone is happy—graffiti nearby rudely denounce the idea</s>

<p>
<s>like hastings’ pier many of england’s seaside towns are in bad repair</s>
<s>wages are lowest in northern resorts such as blackpool but in the otherwiseaffluent south the privation is particularly striking</s>
<s>in hastings the median weekly salary is just £419 17 less than the national figure</s>
<s>in thanet on the far eastern tip of kent the unemployment rate is 11 nearly double the rate in the southeast as a whole</s>
<s>according to government data the most deprived part of england is jaywick a village near the resort of clactononsea in essex</s>

<p>
<s>as in so much of britain this poverty is largely due to the decline of victorian industry says steve fothergill a regional economy expert at sheffield hallam university</s>
<s>while the seaside is still popular with holidaymakers few now go on twoweek holidays to fading victorian resorts</s>
<s>prettier places farther afield such as in devon and cornwall reap the gains instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though some seaside towns such as southendonsea or brighton have tapped into the booming economy of the southeast others such as hastings or margate in thanet now resemble northern manufacturing towns says mr fothergill</s>
<s>victorian grandeur sits alongside modern poverty</s>
<s>new businesses—in particular language schools—are little match for the retreating seaside trade</s>
<s>meanwhile grand old victorian hotels and houses converted into cheap flats attract benefit claimants from neighbouring districts</s>

<s>the previous labour government tried to tackle this problem by spending money on cultural regeneration</s>
<s>the turner contemporary gallery in margate attracted 500000 visitors in its first year—far more than expected</s>
<s>hastings has its own new gallery the jerwood an imposing black building near the fishermen’s beach</s>
<s>folkestone in southern kent has built a “creative quarter” filled with trendy cafés art galleries and gift shops</s>
<s>all this art attracts highspending cultural tourists</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but while new visitors are welcome they are yet to make much fundamental difference</s>
<s>one problem is that the infrastructure isn’t good enough</s>
<s>by train it is quicker to get to many northern cities from london than to hastings points outs amber rudd the local conservative mp</s>
<s>clactononsea and margate are equally remote</s>
<s>weak transport links don’t just deter tourists they also push out residents who cannot commute to better jobs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>southendonsea and brighton are thriving because it is possible to commute to london in under an hour</s>
<s>the overspill of london is changing folkestone too where a new highspeed rail link has roughly halved journey times since 2009</s>
<s>londoners are flocking to buy houses report local estate agents while a glitzy restaurant has just opened</s>
<s>hastings should be so lucky says mrs rudd</s>
<s>commuters from hastings must make do with a few minutes shaved off their journey</s>
