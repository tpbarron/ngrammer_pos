<s>it was as close to a lovein as the home secretary gets in parliament</s>
<s>on october 16th theresa may told a broadly enthusiastic house of commons that gary mckinnon who has admitted hacking into pentagon and nasa computers in a search for ufos would not be extradited to america to stand trial</s>
<s>mr mckinnon has asperger’s syndrome and was thought likely to have killed himself</s>
<s>mrs may not always a fan of the european convention on human rights intervened on the grounds that the rigours of the american criminaljustice system would represent “inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” for a man in his condition</s>
<s>the director of public prosecutions will now decide whether mr mckinnon should stand trial in britain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but mrs may went further</s>
<s>the tenyear fight through the courts to have mr mckinnon tried in his own country for acts committed in it has focused attention on the angloamerican extradition treaty</s>
<s>many think it gives american judges more latitude than british ones</s>
<s>a review by sir scott baker a former judge concluded in 2011 that the treaty was balanced</s>
<s>but a wide coalition of humanrights campaigners legal eagles mps from all main parties and the influential daily mail disagrees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mrs may proposes introducing a “forum bar” permitting british courts to refuse extradition when a case could be tried at home and the interests of justice would be served by doing so</s>
<s>a similar bar was enacted in 2006 but never implemented</s>
<s>sir scott worried that it would lead to further delays in a process already far from speedy</s>
<s>it is to be redrafted and adopted afresh</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the chorus of congratulations there are a few dissenting voices</s>
<s>alan johnson a labour former home secretary thinks mr mckinnon committed a serious offence and deserves to face the transatlantic music for it</s>
<s>washington too sees mr mckinnon as a dangerous defence hacker not an irritating nerd</s>
<s>but david cameron the prime minister has done his best to soften up his opposite number and mr mckinnon’s hacking may seem less threatening now a decade on from 911</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is grumbling too over the fact that other britons whose cases have some similarities to mr mckinnon’s were not reprieved</s>
<s>babar ahmad wanted for allegedly encouraging jihad on the internet from south london was handed over to america two weeks ago along with the hookhanded cleric abu hamza</s>
<s>so was talha ahsan who also suffers from asperger’s syndrome</s>
<s>it is unclear what fate awaits haroon rashid aswat in broadmoor with suspected schizophrenia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those extraditions may have made it easier for mrs may to deny washington mr mckinnon</s>
<s>but the home secretary has the bit between her teeth</s>
<s>on october 15th she confirmed that the government intends to opt out of over 130 eu policing and crime measures with a view to opting back in to better versions of some of them including the european arrest warrant</s>
<s>she says she wants to limit this to serious cases to acts considered crimes in english law and to requests from countries that do not lock up suspects for months and months before trial</s>
<s>mr ahmad imprisoned in britain for over eight years without being charged would doubtless agree</s>
