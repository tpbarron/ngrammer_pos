<p>
<s>india’s cities by and large are charmless and badly put together</s>
<s>that is one reason why the country remains mostly rural see chart 5</s>
<s>twothirds of the population some 833m are living in 640000 villages</s>
<s>politicians such as apj</s>
<s>abdul kalam a former indian president or narendra modi gujarat’s chief minister who talks of “rurban” life want people to stay out of cities and would like the internet electricity schools and jobs to go to rural areas instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since rural voters collectively have clout much public spending flows to the sticks</s>
<s>farmers get subsidised diesel to run pumps</s>
<s>the nrega scheme creates lowpaid makework jobs</s>
<s>the government also pays inflated prices for most wheat and rice then sells much of it back to villagers as cheap rations</s>

<s>village life is often hard for people of low caste women and members of religious or other minorities</s>

<s>aromar revi director of the indian institute for human settlements iihs says that india’s 100 biggest cities with 16 of its total population contribute 43 of its national income</s>

<s>gridlocked mumbai can appear to be falling to bits especially in heavy rains</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the number of towndwellers currently 377m is growing by around 5m a year</s>
<s>historically most urban growth has been due to natural increase not migration</s>
<s>that is changing as countrydwellers see opportunities</s>
<s>so in future india’s urban population will rise much faster doubling by midcentury</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some urban centres will become megacities</s>
<s>according to one vision india’s entire western seaboard could turn into a single conurbation stretching from ahmedabad in gujarat in the north past mumbai and south to thiruvananthapuram in kerala</s>
<s>inland delhi and its environs could be a hub for 60m70m people provided there is enough water</s>
<s>within two decades india will probably have six cities considerably bigger than new york each with at least 10m people ahmedabad bangalore delhi mumbai hyderabad and chennai</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>delhi gets plenty of public money and even japanese donor funds which have helped pay for a newish metro</s>
<s>several other cities including bangalore and ahmedabad are also getting metros</s>
<s>any big metropolis can tap a central fund the jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission for new infrastructure</s>
<s>but there is plenty of growth in smaller places too</s>

<s>towers shoot up especially around the sea link a bridge connecting the southern part of the city to the north</s>
<s>“but we have no urban infrastructure no widening of roads no provision of police” prithviraj chavan the chief minister of maharashtra blames the city’s woes on a “deep nexus of property and political funding”</s>

<s>mr guzder says the entire mumbai metropolitan region is overseen by a single town planner “and she is retiring soon”</s>
<s>mr revi estimates that by 2031 india will be short of 100000 professionals—planners engineers and the like—to manage cities</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>a far more encouraging example can be found farther up the coast</s>
<s>surat a city in gujarat of 45m people is a flourishing trading hub that not long ago was a wretched dump like gorakhpur</s>
<s>in 1994 after a reported but never confirmed outbreak of pneumonic plague it became famous for squalor gridlock slums and rotten management</s>
<s>since then it has been transformed</s>
<s>effective managers cleaned up</s>
<s>rubbish was collected and transport improved streets were swept and public services delivered</s>
<s>miraculously the improvements were sustained</s>
<s>some 96 of residents pay their municipal taxes on time</s>
<s>manoj kumar das who now runs the city says that over the past decade the growth in surat’s population averaged 5 a year among the fastest of any city in the world</s>
<s>according to his planners by 2031 it could have 93m people overtaking london</s>

<p>
<s>it helps that the local economy is thriving with diamond polishing textiles and petrol products doing particularly well</s>
<s>the boss of a diamond firm says his home town has been reshaped and feels great</s>
<s>investors like its reliable power traffic that flows and the cando culture of surtis</s>

<s>when residents felt able to trust officials and their plans they happily contributed to the city’s success</s>
<s>this year firms planted 200000 trees to help make the place greener</s>
</p>

<p>
