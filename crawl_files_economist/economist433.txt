<s>china’s statisticians this week revealed that the country’s economy had grown by 74 in the third quarter</s>
<s>that was china’s slowest rate of expansion since early 2009 see chart and a pale shadow of the 912 rates it recorded back in 2010</s>
<s>so why did stockmarkets and economists around the region react with such relief</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 74 figure was a “yearonyear” calculation comparing china’s economy from july to september with the same period last year</s>
<s>of more interest to investors was the comparison with more recent periods</s>
<s>between the second quarter and the third for example the economy grew at an annualised rate of about 9</s>
<s>that’s enough to fill any china bull with nostalgia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a number of economists concluded that china’s protracted slowdown had at last run its course</s>
<s>their confidence was bolstered by monthly figures showing the economy gaining strength as the third quarter wore on</s>
<s>exports grew by 99 in the year to september for example having grown by only 27 in august</s>
<s>september’s industrial production beat expectations narrowly retail sales beat them comfortably</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many investors have complained that the government’s response to china’s slowdown has been tardy and timid</s>
<s>it has offered no carefully wrapped clearly labelled “stimulus package” to cheer them up</s>
<s>and china’s central bank has not cut interest rates since july or reserve requirements since may</s>
<s>the government has instead eased fiscal and monetary policy behind the scenes hastening infrastructure approvals and buying securities from the banks whenever funds tighten</s>
<s>that lowkey help has begun to show in the figures</s>
<s>infrastructure investment for example grew by 126 in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period of 2011</s>
<s>the money supply as measured by m2 grew by 148</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>september’s figures suggest china’s economy will once again defy its doubters who have long expected a dramatic investment bust</s>
<s>growth is unlikely to slow further in this cycle</s>
<s>but nor will it return to the heady rates of 2010</s>
<s>china’s policymakers seem to have reconciled themselves to growth of 78 not 912 over the medium term</s>
<s>china’s nostalgic bulls will have to do the same</s>
