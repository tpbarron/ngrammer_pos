<p>
<s>does germany “know what it wants to be when it is big” the question is as pertinent now as it was when cees nooteboom a dutch writer posed it shortly after the fall of the berlin wall</s>
<s>in the early months of 1990 furious debate raged in germany over the morality and necessity of reunifying east and west</s>
<s>twenty years on that debate still resonates</s>
<s>the european economy is in tatters and resentment of the german powerhouse as the continent’s paymaster is on the rise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both mr nooteboom a respected novelist and travel writer and günter grass a german nobel laureate originally published their accounts to mark the 20th anniversary of reunification in 2009</s>
<s>both books are now coming out in english for the first time</s>
<s>mr grass’s polemical diary covers 1990 a year he devoted to arguing against the unity package devised by helmut kohl and approved by the east german people</s>
<s>mr nooteboom’s is a more discursive ramble through german identity and history</s>
<s>reunification though accomplished with “indecent haste” was he believes both inevitable and necessary to complete the continent’s recovery from the second world war</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not so fast says mr grass a selfdescribed “notorious pessimist” who told die zeit a weekly newspaper that history had proved him right</s>
<s>the neocolonial “annexation” of the german democratic republic gdr—anschluss is the loaded german term—would produce catastrophe for the east germans he warned at the time</s>
<s>the real outcome has been more nuanced</s>
<s>by some measures east germans have caught up with their western neighbours earnings are nearly equal in some cities and the environment has been transformed</s>
<s>it is nonetheless true that the former gdr remains on an “intravenous drip” from berlin dependent on massive aid to support a 20 unemployment rate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>where mr grass was prescient is in predicting the emergence of “secondclass germans” in the east</s>
<s>in a recent poll twothirds of easterners said they still feel this way whereas the majority of westerners resent the costs they have had to bear</s>
<s>slower reunification might well have forestalled the steamrollering of the east german economy as mr grass argued two decades ago</s>
<s>yet at the time he offered little evidence and came across mainly as a killjoy with nothing good to say about the east germans’ selfliberation</s>
<s>mr grass’s moral authority has since been undermined by revelations that he concealed his wartime service in a branch of the ss</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr nooteboom is a more congenial and informative guide to that momentous time</s>
<s>his berlin reportage from a 1963 khrushchev rally in east berlin to the tearing down of the palast der republik brilliantly captures the intensity of the capital and its “associated layers of memory” in november 1989 while the “pneumatic drills are banging the first holes through the wall” he notes that “at the palast hotel in east berlin a palmcourt ensemble in dinner jackets plays to an audience of bulgarians and koreans” the reader travels with him through the landscape and very idea of the german nation</s>
<s>it is a young country yearning for the settled unity of an england or a france he writes in a voice that blends the acuity of martha gellhorn with the meditative grace of wg</s>
<s>sebald</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>both accounts are steeped in memories of the second world war</s>
<s>fear of resurgent german nationalism is never far from mr grass’s mind</s>
<s>nor is mr nooteboom entirely sanguine</s>
<s>in a piece written earlier this year he begged germans to look beyond the “sacred piggy bank” and remember how much they owe the european union for their own liberation from a shameful past</s>
<s>chancellor angela merkel in athens last month appeared to heed the message</s>
<s>“i am not a teacher to give lessons” she told the greeks</s>
<s>“i come from east germany and i know how long it takes to build reform”</s>
