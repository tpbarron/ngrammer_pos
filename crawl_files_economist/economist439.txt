<s>mark zuckerbergs “law of sharing” is to social media what moores law is to computing power</s>
<s>coined a few years back the facebook founders law asserts that the amount of information shared digitally will double every year</s>
<s>this will never be more evident than in 2012</s>
<s>around the globe people will share more and more of their lives online transforming relationships on every level—personal commercial and institutional</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as we share more of ourselves online well discover that whether were in three ­dimensions or two increasingly one voice will ring out</s>
<s>the use of social media is heading towards the convergence of our virtual and real selves</s>
<s>a famous cartoon once joked “on the internet no one knows youre a dog” now dogs have their own profiles although i suspect someone is helping them with the typing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>expressing our authentic identity will become even more pervasive in the coming year</s>
<s>profiles will no longer be outlines but detailed selfportraits of who we really are including the books we read the music we listen to the distances we run the places we travel the causes we support the videos of cats we laugh at our likes and our links</s>
<s>and yes this shift to authenticity will take getting used to and will elicit cries about lost privacy</s>
<s>but people will increasingly recognise the benefits of such expression</s>
<s>because the strength of social media is that it empowers individuals to amplify and broadcast their voices</s>
<s>the truer that voice the louder it will sound and the farther it will reach</s>

<p>
<s>social media will continue to defy conventional wisdom by using technology to unite rather than separate</s>
<s>the sciencefiction writers of the last century envisioned a world where modernity led to alienation</s>
<s>in fact the opposite has occurred</s>
<s>technology is bringing the world closer together in both obvious and surprising ways</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>heres an obvious one like many others i post photos of my children so that my parents who live 3000 miles away can watch them grow up</s>
<s>i share because they care</s>
<s>less obvious but even more compelling is an emerging new paradigm where a story a photo a plea is posted by a stranger and through connections seen by many</s>
<s>in turn this information provokes strong feelings from viewers—of sympathy outrage solidarity</s>
<s>suddenly “i share because they care” flips and becomes “i care because they share”</s>

<p>
<s>the reversal of this causeandeffect will have a profound impact in 2012 and beyond</s>
<s>a wife posts about her husbands failing kidneys and the need for a typeo donor</s>
<s>a comedian responds and discovers hes a match</s>
<s>the transplant is successful</s>
<s>on a sadder note a nineyearold girl is fatally injured in a car accident</s>
<s>she had earlier made a largehearted appeal for people to donate to a charity that builds wells in africa hoping to raise $300</s>
<s>people from all over the globe respond and raise over $12m in her memory</s>
<s>connections that start as emotional will become more and more tangible</s>
<s>what starts online does not stay online</s>
<s>in the coming year as our sharing increases the caring will too leading to incredible acts of generosity and bravery on both small and large scales</s>

<s>the corollary of caring</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the 2012 american presidentialelection year social media will make us more engaged and involved than ever</s>
<s>and not just from our chairs typing online comments as fast as we can</s>
<s>a recent pew study revealed that facebook users are more than twice as likely to participate in political meetings or rallies</s>
<s>online sharing is leading directly to offline engagement and activism</s>
<s>this phenomenon will be repeated around the world in local and national political debates and elections</s>

<p>
<s>when iceland drafted a new constitution in june 2011 it used social media to put the “revision pen” in the hands of its citizens</s>
<s>after the new zealand earthquakes destroyed homes and businesses in christchurch with damage estimated at more than $10 billion social media enabled the government to connect people to the resources they needed to begin rebuilding their lives</s>
<s>and in the middle east the egyptian people confronted a government that wasnt listening to them and used social technologies to amplify their voices</s>
<s>technology gives a name and a face—a true identity—to those who were previously invisible and it turns up the volume on voices that may have otherwise been too soft to hear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theres no doubt that well see the continued validation of zuckerbergs law of sharing as we dive into 2012</s>
<s>well also see the emergence of something new—a “corollary of caring”—which asserts that as we increase the amount of social information online we will also increase our response to that information in both words and actions</s>
<s>greater sharing around the world is inevitable</s>
<s>deeper and richer caring will be profound </s>
