<s>renÉ brÜlhart made his name as head of liechtenstein’s financialintelligence unit</s>
<s>thanks to his diligence in rooting out financial crime over the past eight years the tiny european principality nestled between switzerland and austria is no longer widely condemned as a haven for dirty money</s>
<s>this success combined with his good looks led one magazine to dub the 40yearold swiss lawyer the james bond of the financial world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his latest job might unnerve even 007 mr brülhart has been recruited to clean up the vatican’s reputation</s>
<s>for years allegations of financial shenanigans have swirled around the institute for works of religion commonly known as the vatican bank</s>
<s>the bank is modest in size as of last november it had just €63 billion $83 billion in assets 33400 accounts and 13 atms for use by its own clients which comprise religious organisations and individuals holy see lay employees and foreign countries’ embassies</s>
<s>but it also has features that make it alluring to moneylaunderers an evaluation in july by moneyval the council of europe’s antimoneylaundering group pointed to high volumes of cash transactions global activities and limited information on many organisations operating in the vatican</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the latest scandal its president ettore gotti tedeschi was sacked in may</s>
<s>he and his former employer are now caught up in a moneylaundering investigation led by naples prosecutors</s>
<s>mr gotti tedeschi has denied wrongdoing saying the reason he was fired was that he got “too close to the truth” about the bank’s dealings</s>
<s>only in december 2010 did pope benedict xvi issue a socalled motu proprio outlawing moneylaundering and the financing of terrorism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr brülhart’s challenge is the same as it was in liechtenstein to get his client onto the allimportant “white list” of territories that are deemed to comply with the standards on combating financial crime set by the oecd a club of rich and emerging economies</s>
<s>first he will need to build a financialintelligence unit that can investigate suspicious money flows properly</s>
<s>the vatican has a group that is supposed to do this but it has made little progress not least because its people lack training</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second he will need to create a truly independent supervising authority for the vatican bank and the administration of the patrimony of the apostolic see which manages the vatican’s property and securities holdings</s>
<s>a supervisorofsorts created by benedict in 2010 the financial information authority fia lacks the legal powers and independence necessary to monitor and sanction these financial institutions according to moneyval</s>
<s>the fia has no clear right to demand access to books for accounts or other information for instance</s>
<s>overall the vatican was compliant or largely compliant with only nine of moneyval’s 16 core standards proving deficient in areas such as customer due diligence and the reporting of suspicious transactions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr brülhart has the right pedigree to help</s>
<s>during his time transforming liechtenstein’s badboy image he was involved in the return of assets owned by the regime of saddam hussein to the new iraqi government as well as in uncovering the siemens bribery scandal</s>
<s>his efforts were recognised by his peers in 2010 when he was appointed deputy head of the egmont group a network of national financialintelligence agencies</s>
<s>his strong catholic credentials should also help</s>
<s>he even studied canon law as a student in fribourg</s>
<s>he is said to have the strong backing of cardinal tarcisio bertone the vatican’s powerful secretary of state who hired him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but he faces unique challenges</s>
<s>the holy see’s financial institutions are not straightforward commercial organisations but “canonically recognised” public entities created to serve the church</s>
<s>it is hard to introduce the sort of rules that brought liechtenstein’s banks to heel</s>
<s>and though he may have the support of the pope’s righthand man he is still an outsider trying to shake up the financial affairs of an ecclesiastical citystate that is notoriously resistant to change and external interference</s>
<s>he will need bondlike cunning to complete his mission</s>
