<s>on september 9th in auckland new zealand the 2011 rugby world cup will kick off in ferocious pacific fashion</s>
<s>new zealands mighty all blacks will stomp the haka their signature maori war dance tongas team will respond with their kailao</s>
<s>the all blacks should prevail in a bruising encounter</s>
<s>from then on the pressure on them to make it to and win the final on october 23rd will be intense</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in every tournament since the first in 1987 the all blacks have started as favourites</s>
<s>but they havent actually lifted the webb ellis trophy since that inaugural amateurage event</s>
<s>instead they have delivered three semifinal failures a dramatic defeat in the final by the hosts south africa in 1995 captured for hollywood in “invictus” and in 2007 a quarterfinal loss to france which kiwis remember as a national tragedy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this time they have home advantage and awesome form</s>
<s>in the 2010 trinations series they triumphed over australia and south africa the current world champions</s>
<s>expectations will be correspondingly high</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for kiwis just hosting the 20nation 48game tournament is an achievement</s>
<s>in 2003 new zealand had been due to cohost with australia but was deprived because of a dispute over advertising rights</s>
<s>for 2011 sneers about a “campervan cup” three cruise ships will provide muchneeded extra accommodation have abounded</s>
<s>the international rugby board stands to make far less than the nz$300m $228m profit it cleared in 2007 when france hosted</s>
<s>new zealand itself is predicted to end up around nz$40m in the red</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in response new zealand is making a virtue of small scale</s>
<s>martin snedden chief of the local organising machine speaks of a “stadium of 4m” with the whole country as hosts</s>
<s>even school holidays are being shifted</s>

<s>with longhaul tourism badly hit by the downturn local operators are hoping to persuade visitors to partake of wineries adventure tourism and other spending opportunities beyond match venues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what if the all blacks dont win</s>
<s>mr snedden insists it is hosting the tournament that matters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>john key new zealands prime minister may disagree</s>
<s>he faces reelection shortly after the final</s>
<s>in 1999 when an election followed an all black failure the government fell</s>
<s>and an all black triumph would strike a blow for gender equality in 2010 the black ferns new zealands womens team won their fourth successive womens rugby world cup</s>
