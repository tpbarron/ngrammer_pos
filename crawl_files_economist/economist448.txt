<s>before local and regional elections on october 14th the ruling united russia party looked weak</s>
<s>it owed its bare majority in the duma to fraud in december’s election</s>
<s>its popularity rating has continued to slide</s>
<s>vladimir milov an opposition leader suggested united russia needed a strong showing for “psychological rehabilitation” in the eyes of voters and president vladimir putin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in these terms united russia could claim some success</s>
<s>it won all five governorships and all six regional legislatures that were at stake</s>
<s>in the moscow suburb of khimki yevgenia chirikova the only highprofile opposition figure to stand lost the mayor’s race by a wide margin</s>
<s>three days later another opposition leader sergei udaltsov was put under house arrest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the polls were the first to be held since governors’ elections were reinstated last spring the biggest concession the kremlin has made to protesters</s>
<s>its strategy for future elections is now clearer</s>
<s>the authorities are betting on low voter turnout as the best way to manage the results</s>
<s>when turnout is low the electoral pool is dominated by older more loyal voters and falsification is easier</s>
<s>ahead of these votes says alexei titkov of the higher school of economics many regions saw “almost unnoticed campaigns” that were lifeless and uninspiring</s>
<s>turnout averaged under 25</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the elections were also reintroduced with a “municipal filter” that keeps truly threatening or merely unapproved challengers off the ballot</s>
<s>a new electoral code will also lead to spoiler parties designed to confuse voters</s>
<s>in these elections the more established communist party had to share the ballot with the communists of russia and the communist party for social justice</s>
<s>the state is playing a “dangerous game” says victor vakhshtayn of the center for fundamental sociology in that it has “returned the institution of elections but in order to keep them under control has to undermine their legitimacy”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite the kremlin’s wishes to keep everything under a bland predictable order elections are always messier than nonelections</s>
<s>the kremlin cannot manage every contest in every corner of russia</s>
<s>the elections in bryansk and ryazan turned into embarrassing scandals as “the machine broke down” according to mr titkov</s>
<s>regional authorities could not agree with each other or with moscow on which candidates should be the winners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the opposition cannot have much sense of optimism after these elections</s>
<s>despite the political turmoil that began last winter and continues today no single force is competing with mr putin for power</s>
<s>the protest movement that burst into the open then is still without a uniting representative party capable of contesting elections</s>
<s>for that the opposition should take much of the blame</s>
<s>most of its bestknown figures sat out the latest elections to prepare for an imminent online vote for seats on a “coordinating council”</s>
<s>some are criticising this parallel body as a distraction</s>
<s>but almost a year after largescale opposition to mr putin first emerged it may be time to give it some sort of representative structure</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the results may also push a diverse opposition to make its ultimate political trajectory clearer whether liberal or nationalist moderate or confrontational</s>
<s>nightly debates aired on the dozhd online television channel have forced leaders to hone their positions beyond the speechifying of rallies</s>
<s>alexei navalny the protest movement’s most popular leader had to clarify some nationalist positions that have given others pause</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>until now each opposition leader could imagine the crowds at moscow protests were for him alone</s>
<s>it will soon be known says dmitry oreshkin a political scientist “how many people each person has standing behind them” the test will still be whether the opposition can go from such virtual politics to the tougher slog of taking on mr putin in the real world</s>
