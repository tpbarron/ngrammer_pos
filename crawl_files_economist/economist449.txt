<s>shashi tharoor a congressman from kerala and onetime undersecretarygeneral at the united nations thinks india is trying to do more but is devoting far too few resources to achieving its foreignpolicy goals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the country’s economy is more closely enmeshed with the rest of the world than ever</s>
<s>foreign trade is now equivalent to 43 of gdp against just 16 two decades ago</s>
<s>by last year india’s twoway trade was worth a total of $794 billion</s>
<s>in march sipri a swedish thinktank ranked the country as the largest single importer of weapons with a 10 share of the world’s total</s>
<s>long a recipient of aid the country is fast becoming a donor dishing out aid and soft loans worth billions of dollars every year</s>
<s>it also has a growing appetite for energy mineral commercial and other interests in africa central asia and elsewhere</s>
<s>and it is an enthusiastic joiner of international groups</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on a shoestring</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this speaks of rising ambitions even if most foreignaffairs experts wisely eschew any talk of an incipient superpower</s>
<s>but the means are limited</s>
<s>mr tharoor notes that the foreign service has only about 800 diplomats less than a fifth of china’s and roughly the same as tiny singapore’s see chart 6</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>overstretch is evident a single official in delhi has to liaise with 19 latin american ambassadors says mr tharoor</s>

<s>“india’s state is a 65yearold who has fat in all the wrong places” concludes c raja mohan a foreignaffairs expert</s>
<s>it has too few border guards customs officials diplomats and soldiers but far too many penpushers in the coal and steel ministries</s>
<s>after decades of facing inwards indian universities thinktanks and commentators are only just beginning to show an interest in foreign matters beyond pakistan so as yet there is only a small corps of experts outside government to help advise policymakers</s>

<p>
<s>some even wonder how much of a grip the national government in delhi is able to keep on foreign policy</s>
<s>regional satraps who bully mr singh on domestic issues have also caused sudden foreignpolicy reversals</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>even so india’s star is rising abroad</s>
<s>sensibly its goals are limited to ensure that its foreign relations serve its big transformation at home</s>
<s>that goes down better with its foreign partners than its sermonising of old</s>
<s>its three main concerns today are america china and its immediate region</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>relations with america have thrived ever since a civil nuclear deal agreed with george w bush seven years ago</s>
<s>cultural ties via india’s diaspora in america help as do stronger trade links</s>
<s>the two countries also share the experience of running big expensive religious materialistic and messy democracies in which central governments are constrained by powerful states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>america is now one of india’s biggest weapons suppliers</s>
<s>mr mohan points to defence orders worth $10 billion for c130 and c17 aircraft missiles and more and says another $10 billion is lined up</s>
<s>last year america failed to sell india a big consignment of fighter jets but that caused only a temporary ripple of bilateral irritation</s>
<s>close cooperation in counterterrorism marine exercises and antipiracy efforts continues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the two powers’ interests are converging</s>
<s>india temporarily on the un security council has voted three times with america against iran over that country’s nuclear programme though it has been cagey over syria</s>
<s>the two collaborate in afghanistan where india is a big civilian donor</s>
<s>crucially america is increasingly adopting india’s stance against extremist groups based on pakistani territory</s>
<s>awkward issues of old such as who should run kashmir no longer get aired</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>india wants america to preserve its ties to pakistan since no one else certainly not china would help moderate pakistani behaviour</s>
<s>but american ties with india will get more important though there will be no formal treaty</s>
<s>and india will increasingly engage with the west</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one big reason is its second concern china’s rise</s>
<s>the two asian powers are developing closer ties notably in trade</s>
<s>but they also vie with each other</s>
<s>a china expert in india’s foreign ministry says that bilateral trade worth just $29 billion in 2000 should pass $100 billion in 2015</s>
<s>but he explains with equal enthusiasm that india has made rapid gains in domestic military mobility</s>
<s>a decade ago it took two months to move several army divisions to defensive positions on a disputed border in the northeast now thanks to better roads it takes just two weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in myanmar and elsewhere in the region the two asian giants compete for influence and energy supplies</s>
<s>at the same time india is wary of china’s ability to make trouble for example over tibet and the dalai lama who lives in india</s>
<s>and disputes continue along the still unfixed indiachina border the site of a humiliating frontier war 50 years ago that india lost</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>india wants a stronger military deterrent</s>
<s>in april it testfired a homebuilt longrange nuclearcapable missile the agniv which in theory could strike china’s big cities</s>
<s>and it is putting more soldiers and aircraft at permanent forward bases along the border</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>farther east too india is forging links with democracies and those already close to america</s>
<s>ties with australia will improve as it looks poised to announce that it will sell uranium for india’s domestic nuclear plants</s>
<s>india has become modestly active in oil exploration in the south china sea</s>
<s>and it is a big recipient of aid and investment from japan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just in case</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>last and long overdue india is doing more to improve relations in its region</s>
<s>mr singh says he is ready to visit his own birthplace in pakistani punjab if only pakistan would do more to stop terrorists who attack india or at least to agree to india’s requests for more open trade</s>
<s>india is also trying to boost trade by building better border infrastructure and loosening nontariff barriers</s>
<s>this month the countries’ foreign ministers at last signed a deal easing their bilateral visa regime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though still poorly resourced india’s foreign affairs seem better run than they have been for a long time</s>
<s>gone are the days when indian leaders abroad somehow managed to appear arrogant moralising and ineffectual all at the same time</s>
<s>india’s policy may lack frills but at least it has a clear purpose</s>
