<s>the campaign pledges of most of the 192 candidates for police and crime commissioner pcc make for uninspiring reading</s>
<s>a conservative aspirant plans to reduce crime put people first and make the police pound go farther</s>
<s>a labour candidate promises to get police on the streets work with communities and listen to residents</s>
<s>a liberal democrat will put more bobbies on the beat and cut waste</s>
<s>and so on</s>
<s>to elicit these bromides prospective voters must find their way to a home office website listing the hopefuls</s>
<s>small wonder that turnout for the pcc elections on november 15th is expected to be pitiful</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>creating directlyelected watchdogs to give communities more say in how they are policed was once among the conservativeled coalition’s most eyecatching reforms</s>
<s>the pccs—one for each of the 41 police forces in england and wales outside london—will like the appointed multimember authorities they are replacing set priorities determine budgets and counciltax precepts and hire and fire the chief constable</s>
<s>a single visible figure is to become the lightning rod for local discontent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reforms are poorly conceived</s>
<s>they give too much power to individuals barely restrained by panels of worthies</s>
<s>the regions for which each pcc will be responsible are too big for genuinely local concerns to emerge easily one commissioner must reflect the priorities of bucolic somerset as well as bristol’s mean streets</s>
<s>the government insists the new system will not cost more than the old one but the multilayered edifice will certainly not be cheaper even before counting national elections every four years</s>
<s>and though pccs are not supposed to interfere with daytoday policing many candidates cannot fulfil their campaign pledges unless they do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>democratic accountability has somehow morphed into political control of a police service that has pursued its duties outside the political arena for almost two centuries</s>
<s>it is arguable whether a public service that can use force and deals more than most with minorities as both victims and perpetrators of crime should ever be bound by the will of the majority—other than through a mayor elected to run things across the board</s>
<s>but at least the reform was supposed to produce a vibrant new breed of independent watchdogs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that has not happened</s>
<s>many independents with no party to contribute funds or manpower were daunted by the cost of standing</s>
<s>forfeitable deposits were set at £5000 $8000 ten times those required of candidates for mp</s>
<s>bored by its reform or spooked by the criticism it provoked in many quarters the government refused to distribute candidates’ information with free mailshots insisting voters go to a tardily launched website instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the event less than threetenths of all candidates describe themselves as independents</s>
<s>some are lib dems who declared an interest before their party decided to let members participate others are so bunched that none has a real chance of victory</s>
<s>well over half of all candidates are or were elected officials many looking for a cushy last job or a step up to the next one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a late lacklustre official publicity campaign has failed to inspire voters</s>
<s>so low are expectations that theresa may the home secretary has had to explain that no matter how many or how few turn out the pccs are coming</s>
<s>the tories hope to capitalise on their lead on lawandorder issues to expand their foothold in the north</s>
<s>labour opposes the reform in theory but is pleased at the prospect of winning a lot of influential new posts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the police face severe difficulties</s>
<s>their centralgovernment funding is being cut by 20 in this parliament and forces must restructure drastically</s>
<s>pccs are not a magic answer to these and other problems</s>
<s>but they will be powerful and wellpaid</s>
<s>if turnout in next week’s elections is really low england and wales scotland is sensibly sticking with police authorities could end up with mighty figures who feel untrammelled by public scrutiny</s>
<s>that would be the worst of all worlds</s>
