<s>an iconic moment in israeli politics captured by the tv cameras in october 1997 showed binyamin netanyahu then in his first term as prime minister leaning towards yitzhak keddouri a venerable kabbalistic sage both pictured right and speaking into his ear</s>
<s>the microphones could not quite make out his words but an alert reporter lipread them “the leftists have forgotten what it means to be jewish” the aged rabbi seemed to smile in assent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rabbi keddouri has since died and mr netanyahu is back as prime minister much chastened and matured</s>
<s>he now avoids giving gratuitous offence and shields his mouth when whispering in people’s ears</s>
<s>but his political profile remains the same he presides over a rightistreligious coalition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>following in the footsteps of menachem begin the first likud party prime minister 197783 mr netanyahu has welded an alliance of three distinct ideological groups his own revisionistzionist party together with the rightist russian immigrant party yisrael beitenu the orthodoxzionists who have spawned the settler movement on the west bank and the haredim or ultraorthodox the fastestgrowing sector in israeli society</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr netanyahu calls his tripartite alliance the “national camp” and implies that it is not only more patriotic than the “peace camp” meaning mainly those in opposition but also somehow more jewish</s>
<s>he has deftly subsumed into his political message not just jewish nationalism but judaism itself</s>
<s>his settler allies moreover have developed a messianic theology based on a fundamentalist reading of the bible which sets the conquest and settlement of the land above all else and promises direct divine succour to achieve them</s>
<s>these teachings have subtly penetrated and influenced much broader swathes of israel’s politics and culture</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the conflation of hawkishness and jewishness is in evidence in the diaspora too where it blurs criticism of israel’s occupation policy with antisemitism</s>
<s>if “antiisrael” equals antisemitic ie antijewish then israel and specifically the occupation policy being criticised equals jewish</s>
<s>qed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the strong point of this argument is that antisemitism vicious and irrational is rising once more especially in europe see chart 4</s>
<s>in hungary it has become particularly virulent jews there fear for their physical safety</s>
<s>antisemitism comes in neonazi and hardleft varieties and of late it has been embraced by muslim groups too</s>
<s>antisemites are usually antiisrael many oppose israel’s very existence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover iran’s president mahmoud ahmadinejad is both antiisrael and antisemitic and a holocaust denier to boot</s>
<s>his government is working hard to obtain the means to implement his threats to annihilate the jewish state</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for the israeli right and for many jewish communal leaders in the diaspora an undifferentiated axis of evil extends from the iranians to the palestinians and on to antisemitic thugs on european streets</s>
<s>rising antisemitism is lumped together with growing criticism of israeli policy and hyped by mr netanyahu’s government into what it calls a campaign for the “delegitimation” of israel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the advantage of this tactic is that any critic whether jew or gentile can be dismissed as a delegitimiser and hence an antisemite</s>
<s>the much deeper disadvantage is that it fosters paranoia towards the palestinians with whom israel needs to come to terms if it is to survive as a jewish and democratic state</s>
<s>in rightistreligious circles even to point out this drawback is beginning to be dubbed antijewish and antigod</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one jewish voice that has been heard questioning the dominant zeitgeist is that of mick davis the longtime chief executive of xstrata an international mining giant</s>
<s>born in south africa he serves as chairman of the jewish leadership council a britishjewish umbrella organisation and controversially gave warning in late 2010 that israel risked becoming an apartheid state unless it negotiated peace with the palestinians</s>
<s>he has since bowed to pressure to pipe down in public though he denies having done so confining himself to encouraging peacenik jewish dissidents not to turn their backs on the mainstream community</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“if the prime minister of israel wants to speak for the jewish people” he says “then he must articulate the values of the jewish people and he doesn’t do that</s>
<s>settlements can’t possibly be the values of the jewish people</s>
<s>the jewish people place great emphasis on life on how they interact with their fellow men</s>
<s>how can building settlements willynilly be jewish values simply because you say there’s a mitzva religious precept to occupy the land”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but are his jewish values not diasporic values</s>
<s>“then israel is just a state for israelis” he retorts</s>
<s>“israel is as much our project as it’s the project of israelis</s>
<s>the whole history of the jews has been a constant struggle to meet the values that we think are immutable…when israel doesn’t struggle to meet them then that impacts my identity as a jew and i am diminished by that”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for menachem lorberbaum chair of the graduate school of philosophy at tel aviv university israel’s victimhood politics is “the very antithesis of zionism” and also profoundly unjewish</s>
<s>“neither bibi mr netanyahu nor barak ehud barak the defence minister know anything about judaism and i don’t see them as spokespeople for what judaism is or ought to be…the state of israel doesn’t own judaism…israel is the greatest opportunity to exercise sovereignty for the purpose of creating a viable and sustainable jewish society</s>
<s>but it’s also the greatest seduction—the seduction to define jewish as a political category…of course being the victim gives you lots of points</s>
<s>‘they’re out to destroy us’ is a knockdown argument</s>
<s>but what it does is to legitimise unbridled use of power”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tal becker an israeli diplomat and scholar worries that israeli policies—both peace policy and domestic policy which rejects nonorthodox judaism—are leading to schism within jewry</s>
<s>“among jews whose jewishness is important to them the fault line is between those for whom being jewish is about the survival of israel and for whom orthodoxy is the authentic form of judaism and those who have a very diverse pluralistic expression of their judaism</s>
<s>the preoccupation of so many israeli jews with survival and not with the reasons why survival is important has alienated them from jews who feel our survival is not at risk who feel disenchanted with israel…for many jews the tension between supporting israel and having liberal values is becoming less sustainable”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this fusion of orthodoxy with what mr becker calls “deathnarrative nationalism” is the underpinning of mr netanyahu’s political success</s>
<s>mr becker voices the conventional liberal wisdom when he accepts that they constitute a package deal instead of prising them apart</s>
<s>arguably this refusal of the liberal left to distinguish between the two very different strains within orthodoxy is tragically shortsighted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fear of god</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as long as haredism was small and weak in israel and in the diaspora it could be dismissed as irrelevant</s>
<s>reluctant to cooperate with pollsters for fear of the “evil eye” haredim have been undercounted for decades</s>
<s>but last month a new report commissioned by the ujafederation of new york the leading communal philanthropic organisation showed that of the estimated 15m jews in greater new york including nassau suffolk and westchester 22 are haredi and 10 modernorthodox</s>
<s>given the haredi birth rate—“at least three times that associated with nonorthodox new yorkers”—the haredi proportion is growing rapidly</s>
<s>the report suggests that perhaps not enough poor haredim take advantage of the services the ujafederation offers</s>
<s>haredi activists have long claimed that their community does not get its fair share of welfare services</s>
<s>most new york haredim unlike most israeli ones work for their living but only 11 of them contribute to the ujafederation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a century ago the haredi rabbis of poland and russia took a generally jaundiced view of zionism which was then just starting up</s>
<s>they thought god would restore his people to the holy land in his own good time</s>
<s>but as the zionist enterprise in palestine began to grow so did a pragmatic streak within haredism that wanted to join in</s>
<s>a haredi minister served in bengurion’s first government</s>
<s>hardcore recalcitrants continue to see israel as sinfully presumptuous but the majority have come to terms with it</s>
<s>unlike the modernorthodox though the haredim have not become messianic</s>
<s>they still have theological misgivings about zionism and certainly about zionist expansionism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hence they pointedly do not settle deep in the palestinian territories</s>
<s>two large haredi settlements betar ilit and modi’in ilit are situated by order of the rabbis just over the 1967 border on land that would probably be annexed to israel in a negotiated peace with the palestinians</s>
<s>they ought to be part of the “peace camp” alongside the israeli doves and the diaspora jewish liberals</s>
<s>they are not there mainly because the liberals’ pluralism stops when it comes to the haredim</s>
<s>they are seen as fundamentalist fanatical misogynist and determined to impose their culture and values upon the majority</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the haredim do their bit to fan these prejudices</s>
<s>they prefer to live apart and for the most part they show contempt for the less orthodox and loathing for the avowedly nonorthodox</s>
<s>it is the antiharedi prejudices on the left that help sustain mr netanyahu’s coalition of all the orthodox with the hardline right</s>
<s>two centuries after the breakdown of traditional religious authority jews are still fiercely fighting for each other’s hearts and minds</s>
<s>only now the prize is not a rabbinical appointment in some shtetl but the political direction of a powerful sovereign state</s>
<s>thanks to liberal arrogance and haredi disdain the settlers’ messianic nationalism is increasingly setting the tone</s>
