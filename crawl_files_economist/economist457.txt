<s>two of their own were tying the knot naftali a student at the rabbinerseminar zu berlin naomi a student at the women’s midrasha both of them members of the learning community of yeshivat beit zion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the wedding party were several other sons and daughters “of our patriarch abraham” the term traditionally used to describe converts to judaism</s>
<s>naomi’s mother died when the family was still in russia and her jewish ancestry was unclear</s>
<s>the yeshiva rabbis required the bride to undergo a conversion ceremony which involves immersion in a ritual bath and a solemn commitment “to accept the yoke of mitzvot religious precepts”</s>

<p>
<s>almost everybody in the beit zion community is russian as are most of the 200000odd jews in germany today</s>

<p>
<s>the original rabbinerseminar zu berlin was founded by rabbi esriel hildesheimer in 1873</s>
<s>it was intended as beleaguered german orthodoxy’s answer to the jüdischtheologische seminar in breslau now wroclaw in poland the crucible of conservative judaism and the hochschule für die wissenschaft des judentums the reform rabbinical seminary also in berlin</s>
<s>rabbi hildesheimer’s seminary ordained modernorthodox rabbis who served communities throughout europe</s>
<s>its basic outlook was that although jewish law the halacha was immutable it had to be couched in contemporary language</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today the reconstituted rabbinerseminar walks the same delicate path between haredism and modernity</s>
<s>the funding comes mainly from the ronald s lauder foundation which has helped to bring about a modest renaissance of jewish life in germany and central and eastern europe</s>
<s>an early practitioner of postdenominational judaism the foundation supports every kind of jewish education</s>

<s>for their part the newcomers have breathed new life into oncegreat jewish communities</s>
<s>“we are not orthodox” says beatrisa kirschner a young jewish immigrant from moldova who lives with her extended family in mainz</s>
<s>“but we are traditional</s>
<s>the religion was repressed in the soviet union</s>
<s>now the old people like my grandad want to have it again” ms kirschner’s 98yearold grandfather likes to spend his days in the striking new synagogue in mainz which replaced one built a century ago and destroyed by the nazis</s>
<s>the prayer books are in hebrew with russian translation</s>
<s>ms kirschner’s mother a nurse is on the synagogue council and her young son will attend the religion classes</s>
<s>the synagogue’s president stella schindlersigereich grew up in nearby worms</s>
<s>“who would have thought i’d be a synagogue president”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>speyer worms and mainz the “shum” communities in the hebrew acronym were an important centre of medieval jewish scholarship</s>
<s>in speyer visitors can see a perfectly preserved 12thcentury jewish ritual bath in the grounds of the restored jewish quarter in the shadow of the huge romanesque cathedral</s>
<s>in the centre of worms unaccountably intact lies a large jewish cemetery</s>
<s>the hebrew gravestones clearly legible go back to the 11th century</s>
<s>the state of rhinelandpalatinate is applying to unesco to have the three ancient jewish communities recognised as a world heritage site</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the revival of jewish life among some of the russian jews in germany has been an important corrective for thinking israelis</s>
<s>in the 1980s and 1990s when jews streamed out of the soviet union their exit visas all citing israel as their destination israel fought foreign governments and diaspora jewish organisations to stop them dropping off on the way</s>
<s>they were not refugees the israeli government and the world zionist organisation contended</s>
<s>they had a homeland israel</s>
<s>outside israel their jewish identity would die</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this has not happened in germany nor in america where the mixture of assimilation religiosity and ethnic identity among the hundreds of thousands of exsoviet jews who live there is similar to that of the broader jewish community</s>
<s>all this suggests that diasporas are more resilient than dogmas of zionist primacy admit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most german jewish communities restrict their membership to halachic jews only that is those born of a jewish mother or converted to judaism in accordance with the halacha</s>
<s>many of the russian immigrants do not qualify for membership</s>
<s>some of them undergo conversion most do not leaving them in a sort of jewish limbo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in this respect german jewry resembles israel’s</s>
<s>there this question of “who is a jew” presents the jewish state and its state religion orthodox judaism with a challenge</s>
<s>halachic precedents over the centuries provide ample basis for a lenient approach to “accepting the yoke of mitzvot” in the conversion process</s>
<s>but the increasingly powerful haredi rabbis insist that converts pledge to become orthodox</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>flashpoint conversion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>conversion is the point where religious rigidity israeli politics and diaspora denominationalism clash</s>
<s>the conservative and reform movements in america have long fought orthodoxy’s monopoly on judaism in israel</s>
<s>earlier this year facing a high court action brought by an israeli reform rabbi the israeli government announced that it will fund a small number of nonorthodox rabbis around the country</s>
<s>but they will still have no power to conduct marriages or conversions</s>
<s>the nonorthodox movements nevertheless hailed the decision as a breakthrough</s>
<s>they claim that it is official discrimination that has kept them marginal in israeli society</s>
<s>as americans they are uncomfortable with the notion of a state religion</s>
<s>as jews they reject the idea that israel’s state religion is orthodox judaism rather than just judaism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>israel then is the transferred battlefield for american jewry’s interdenominational warfare</s>
<s>nonorthodox leaders in america are apt to warn israeli prime ministers that pandering to the orthodox will dismay millions of american jews</s>
<s>mr netanyahu who spent his formative years in america is sensitive to such admonitions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are two big complications</s>
<s>the first is a yawning divide between the conservative and the reform movements on the question of “who is a jew”</s>
<s>reform judaism in 1983 recognised patrilineal jews—those born of a jewish father but a gentile mother—as full jews provided they chose to live jewish lives</s>
<s>conservative judaism has stuck with the traditional matrilineal criterion</s>
<s>hundreds of thousands of americans who are accepted as jews by reform synagogues are not considered jewish by conservative rabbis</s>
<s>reform’s position also contradicts israeli law which takes matrilinealism as the criterion for jewish descent</s>
<s>and most conservative rabbis would not recognise most reform rabbis’ conversions on halachic grounds says rabbi joel roth a professor at the conservatives’ jewish theological seminary and a smallc conservative</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second more troublesome complication is that the turf war waged by the two nonorthodox movements against israeli orthodoxy has prejudiced the prospects of russianisraelis quietly being converted</s>
<s>earlier this year avigdor lieberman’s russian immigrant party yisrael beitenu reached a deal with the haredi parties that would have enabled more moderate modernorthodox rabbis to sit on conversion courts</s>
<s>as a quid pro quo the new law would have cemented the orthodox monopoly over conversion</s>
<s>but the conservative and reform leaderships in america persuaded mr netanyahu to undo the deal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rabbi david ellenson president of the reform hebrew union college staunchly defends the nonorthodox case</s>
<s>“there have to be other ways” he says</s>
<s>“why should i be asked to commit suicide” he grew up orthodox in a closeknit community in newport news virginia and recalls his class at day school reciting each morning “first of all we must know that the entire torah both the written law and the oral law was given by the holy one himself blessed be he to moses our teacher of blessed memory at mount sinai</s>
<s>it is impossible to change even the tiniest jot or tittle…” but he stopped believing in that and notes that “most modern jews don’t” either</s>
<s>“i see all the denominations as attempting to provide a response to the same question</s>
<s>we are all on a continuum” for him reform is the most authentic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>remarkably rabbi ellenson has devoted his career as a historian to the study of orthodox responses to modernity</s>
<s>his 1990 biography of rabbi hildesheimer the founder of the berlin rabbinerseminar was a classic</s>
<s>most recently he coauthored an important study of 19th and 20thcentury orthodox rabbinical views on conversion</s>
<s>he claims he can be at once the dispassionate analyst in his books and the passionate polemicist in his rabbinical role and he pretty much pulls it off</s>
<s>but on a deeper level this highly regarded denominational leader seems to embody the postdenominational future of judaism</s>
<s>many of today’s jews and probably many more of tomorrow’s are on the continuum he describes consciously or not</s>
<s>they are reaching out beyond the old divides of israeli religiousness and secularism diasporic orthodoxy conservatism and reform</s>
