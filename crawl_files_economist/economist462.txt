<s>in the spring of 1945 the polish city of lodz was swamped with refugees</s>
<s>local women organised themselves to help</s>
<s>opening a shelter at the city railway station they called themselves the women’s league</s>
<s>five years later the league had been transformed</s>
<s>it had a central office in warsaw which controlled its regional offices and its goals were to “raise the level of women’s social consciousness” and to mobilise them “to the most complete realisation of the goals of the sixyear plan”</s>
<s>it had become in other words the women’s section of the polish communist party</s>
<s>all over central europe fledgling elements of civil society—clubs associations schools and churches—were thus coopted into new sovietoccupied communist states</s>
<s>how did this happen and why did the soviet union’s attempt to impose totalitarianism on its new empire ultimately fail</s>
<s>these are the questions that lie at the core of anne applebaum’s illuminating new book</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>though from the outset central europeans suffered arbitrary expropriations and arrests initially the soviet authorities sought to create the semblance of national independence and political pluralism</s>
<s>local communist parties ruled in notional coalitions</s>
<s>national symbols were reinstated</s>
<s>in berlin the future spymaster markus wolf hosted a radio programme entitled “you ask we answer” which as well as praising russian communism answered listeners’ queries on vegetable supplies and the reopening of the berlin zoo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mask dropped with the first postwar elections</s>
<s>these were held ms applebaum stresses because central europe’s “little stalins” sincerely believed they would win</s>
<s>in the event in hungary’s national elections of november 1945 the communists took just 17 of the vote and in january 1947 the polish peasants’ party led by a former member of general wladyslaw sikorksi’s governmentinexile won a parliamentary election so thoroughly despite violent intimidation that the results had brazenly to be falsified</s>
<s>nowhere were the real victors allowed to take power and opposition leaders were subsequently arrested or fled into exile</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the solution to this moscow believed was not less communism but more</s>
<s>central europeans like russians could be moulded into homo sovieticus conformist optimistic hardworking and socially conscious</s>
<s>across the block schoolchildren like their russian counterparts before them started learning ditties in praise of stalin</s>
<s>in factories workers competed to become stakhanovite “shockworkers”</s>
<s>writers and artists lured home by promises of fat commissions and vast print runs found themselves turning out unreadable novels and socialist realist murals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but stalinism contained the seeds of its own destruction</s>
<s>in a system that seeks to control everything ms applebaum points out any sort of spontaneity or individuality however apolitical becomes a form of protest</s>
<s>and spontaneity there was</s>
<s>in newly built steel towns anxious officials reported workers failed to attend the theatre after work haunting instead pubs and underground brothels</s>
<s>young people began sporting drainpipe trousers ducktail quiffs kipper ties and makarturki named for the style of sunglasses worn by general douglas macarthur</s>
<s>in germany hundreds of thousands crossed from east to west despite evertightening soviet border controls</s>
<s>everywhere people told bitterly satirical jokes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cracks widened dramatically with stalin’s death in march 1953</s>
<s>within months strikes broke out in several german cities demands for better pay being underlined by attacks on party headquarters and russianlanguage bookshops</s>
<s>walter ulbricht and his puppet government holed up in the offices of the soviet ambassador and russian tanks not east german police fired at the demonstrators</s>
<s>three years later a second shock nikita khrushchev’s “secret speech” to the 20th party congress denouncing stalin’s purges and personality cult sparked the hungarian uprising</s>
<s>it was crushed but so too was the totalitarian dream</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>human beings as ms applebaum rousingly concludes do not acquire “totalitarian personalities” with ease</s>
<s>even when they seem bewitched by the cult of the leader or of the party appearances can deceive she writes</s>
<s>when it seems as if they buy into the most absurd propaganda—marching in parades chanting slogans singing that the party is always right—the spell can suddenly unexpectedly dramatically be broken</s>

<s>anne applebaum will be discussing iron curtain as part of the economists books of the year festival at southbank centre in london on december 8th 2012</s>
