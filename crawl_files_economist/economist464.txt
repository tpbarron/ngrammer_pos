<s>in america an observant jew senator joseph lieberman ran for vicepresident in 2000</s>
<s>with al gore as candidate for president he nearly made it</s>
<s>his jewish faith was no drawback he says rather it appealed to many christian voters who take their own religion seriously</s>
<s>mr lieberman and his wife hadassah “were dreaming of a large suka” a rustic hut covered with branches in which jews eat and entertain during the sukot harvest festival in the grounds of the vicepresident’s residence</s>
<s>“we felt we could be ourselves” had he had gone on to run for the white house as he hoped “i’d have been observant there too”</s>

<s>in the smaller diaspora communities too jews are prospering though there is nowhere with quite that same sense of complete seamless belonging as in america</s>
<s>in russia and ukraine where judaism and zionism were repressed in communist times jews are prominent in business</s>
<s>jewish philanthropy is rebuilding community life for those who opted to stay rather than emigrate to israel or the west</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>israel and the jewish diaspora moreover are in strong and loyal alignment</s>
<s>diaspora jews broadly speaking love and cherish israel</s>
<s>they support it against its enemies real and perceived they back its government and they resent its critics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of this could have been predicted just a few decades ago</s>
<s>hitler had wiped out onethird of the jewish people</s>
<s>a thousand years of jewish civilisation in central and eastern europe had been swept away</s>
<s>fortunately for jewish survival the nazis’ “final solution” had been preceded by a flurry of pogroms across the thentsarist empire that started 60 years earlier sending waves of mass jewish emigration westward</s>
<s>by the time hitler struck some 6m jews were safe in north and south america and in britain with 3m more living in the soviet union</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>traditional religious learning and observance had been on the defensive in central and eastern europe for 150 years since political emancipation in parts of the region opened the gates of ghettoes and tradition in the shtetls small jewish communities was shaken up</s>
<s>now the old life was annihilated along with much of modern liberal jewish culture</s>
<s>the sephardic communities of north africa and the levant long a minority within jewry gained new numerical significance</s>
<s>together with the pitifully few survivors of nazioccupied europe they became the core population of the new state of israel</s>

<s>bengurion’s error</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>its founding fathers socialistzionists in the main thought that the vestiges of the old religion would soon disappear</s>
<s>david bengurion israel’s first prime minister held that the 2000 years of diasporic judaism were a deviation from the true fulfilment of the jewish ethos</s>
<s>the talmud judaism’s ancient body of law and lore was too casuistic he felt the new state must hark back to the bible</s>
<s>but he agreed to exempt a few hundred talmud students from army service confident they were a dying breed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>before the holocaust zionism the movement for jewish independence in palestine had to struggle for jewish popular support</s>
<s>now it was vindicated at least in its own eyes</s>
<s>but some jews especially in america were still not convinced</s>
<s>israel fighting for its survival flooded by destitute immigrants looked precarious to them</s>
<s>in america assimilation was the watchword</s>
<s>attenuated forms of religious practice that originated in 19th century germany were embraced by the upwardly mobile children and grandchildren of the immigrant generation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>american jews’ standoffishness towards their jewish nationhood shifted sharply after the sixday war in 1967</s>
<s>the collective experience of fear and then relief and jubilation produced an outpouring of solidarity with the beleaguered jewish state</s>
<s>mixed in with these emotions was a sense of unease even guilt over the ineffectiveness of american jewish lobbying during the holocaust to get president roosevelt to rescue jews</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sociologists say that israel—and fundraising and lobbying on its behalf—became american jewry’s “secular religion”</s>
<s>a vocal grassroots campaign to free emigration for soviet jewry also attracted wide support especially among younger jews</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the turn of the 21st century moreover postmodernism was cocking an unexpected snook both at dogmatic israeli godlessness and at diaspora assimilationism</s>
<s>“postmodernism has been kind to all religions” says moshe halbertal a philosopher living in jerusalem</s>
<s>“reason was dethroned there’s no large narrative out there any more” hyphenated ethnicities and identities encourage people to enjoy and display their diversities instead of keeping them out of sight</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many diaspora jews today still drift out of judaism or out of jewishness or choose to leave</s>
<s>but many others are consciously deciding to stay in choosing one of myriad new ways to express their commitment</s>
<s>exactly what defines jewishness remains a matter of much debate</s>
<s>this special report will concentrate on those who formally identify with the faith see table for the main denominations but in israel even the nonreligious are influenced by jewish culture and mores</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jewish orthodoxy has come surging back</s>
<s>early marriages and high birth rates have produced a demographic explosion among the ultraorthodox haredim godfearers</s>
<s>this has pumped up their numbers compensating for the steady outflow from active judaism caused by assimilation</s>
<s>the overall total of jews worldwide is somewhat higher than it was 40 years ago see chart above</s>
<s>by conservative estimates one in ten jews is now haredi</s>
<s>the “modernorthodox” account for another 10</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many israelis like to think of themselves as “traditional”</s>
<s>but even the avowedly secular live jewish lives and indeed religious lives in many subliminal ways and israel increasingly radiates its national cultural and religious jewishness into the diaspora communities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>following the collapse of the peace process with the palestinians in 2000 and the violent intifada uprising that followed israeli political attitudes have palpably hardened</s>
<s>in theory all israeli mainstream parties are committed to a “twostate solution” in practice the growing modernorthodox settler movement in the west bank spearheads a government policy of occupation without end</s>
<s>to sustain and justify that policy a stridently nationalistic zeitgeist is evolving</s>
<s>in the absence of progress towards peace that may be inevitable</s>
<s>perhaps it is inevitable too that it is winning the soul of diaspora jewry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>our kind of peace</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>doubtless most members of a nonorthodox synagogue in suburban connecticut like most israelis and diaspora jews would tell pollsters that they support peace and two states</s>
<s>the atmosphere there on a recent sunday could hardly have been more civilised</s>
<s>jews christians and muslims munched hot dogs and coleslaw together before setting out to clean up the neighbourhood park</s>
<s>the rabbi spoke words of appropriate interfaith inspiration</s>
<s>in the library the synagogue staff had spread carpets on the floor for the muslims to pray</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the corridor outside this temporary mosque two muslim schoolboys read the israeli declaration of independence “we extend our hand of peace and unity to all the neighbouring states and their peoples” it was displayed alongside a map of the region</s>
<s>“no gaza” one noted</s>
<s>“no west bank either” his brother added</s>
<s>a synagogue warden explained later that the map was “biblical not political”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the prevailing political sentiment in jewry today is of aggressive defensiveness a curious amalgam of victimhood and intolerance</s>
<s>dissent about israel is discouraged and often gagged outright</s>
<s>among british jewry some 300000 strong “a positively mccarthyite atmosphere has been created” says jonathan freedland a political columnist</s>
<s>“people are frightened to say what they feel” in america “honest discussion about israel is largely shut down” notes arnold eisen a historian and chancellor of the jewish theological seminary a rabbinical school in new york</s>
<s>“some rabbis will speak their minds…but people don’t want to fight and there is a disinclination to argue about israel</s>
<s>the right says you’re giving aid and comfort to the enemy if you say anything critical about any israeli policy” given israel’s power and diaspora jewry’s strength and influence that seems paradoxical</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>resurgent religious faith is deeply caught up in this</s>
<s>nationalism xenophobia and judaism blur and merge</s>
<s>jews find themselves out of step with most of world opinion which heightens a widespread sense of apprehensiveness</s>
<s>iran’s threats and nuclear pretensions provide a focus for these feelings</s>
<s>diaspora jewish leaders insist that israel is misunderstood</s>
<s>they attribute criticism to antisemitism which is rising again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>arthur green a scholar of jewish mysticism and a professor at a rabbinical school in boston blames israel’s policy and american jewry’s blanket support for it “for the fact that lots and lots of thinking jews are walking away</s>
<s>and then we say well they’re not committed jews anyway so who cares about them”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the accusation that israeli hawkishness turns young diaspora jews off their judaism and their jewishness has been trenchantly advanced by peter beinart a journalist in washington dc</s>
<s>it has caused huge controversy among american jewry</s>
<s>but many other experts deny the causal link</s>
<s>jews especially younger ones have been dropping out in large numbers for years mr eisen points out</s>
<s>as their attachment to judaism weakens so does their commitment to israel</s>
<s>those who criticise israel and incur the community’s wrath care at least as much as those who try to silence them</s>
<s>“love has a voice” he insists</s>
