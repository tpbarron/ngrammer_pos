<s>a giant kurdish flag undulating atop a raised plateau inside syria faces the town of senyurt in turkey’s mainly kurdish southeast</s>
<s>at the local headquarters of the ruling justice and development ak party a grey slab engraved with ataturk’s aphorism “happy is he who calls himself a turk” gathers dust under a stairwell</s>
<s>across the street at the gendarmerie another slogan—“loyalty to the army is our honour”—glints through barbed wire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the scene encapsulates turkey’s kurdish and syrian impasse</s>
<s>the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has long called for syria’s president bashar assad to go</s>
<s>turkey now hosts over 100000 refugees from syria</s>
<s>tensions between the two countries have almost tipped into open war</s>
<s>yet there is no sign of an early end to the syrian conflict</s>
<s>and the withdrawal of syrian forces from mainly kurdish towns along the border has raised the stakes in the turkish state’s 28year battle with the kurdistan workers’ party pkk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the towns are now run by the pkk’s syrian franchise the democratic union party pyd</s>
<s>as well as setting up kurdishlanguage schools and kurdish outfits the pyd is busily arming itself forming three battalions so far</s>
<s>it claims this is to defend against the chaos that may ensue after mr assad’s fall</s>
<s>but in the eyes of an increasingly hawkish mr erdogan the pyd is the pkk—and its main enemy is turkey</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the kurds fear they not mr assad’s forces are the target of turkish troops and tanks deployed along the border</s>
<s>they think a bill just adopted by the turkish parliament to authorise the army to intervene abroad is aimed at them</s>
<s>this is overwrought</s>
<s>yet turkey is clearly rattled by the prospect of a quasiindependent syriankurdish entity emerging beside the iraqikurdish statelet in northern iraq</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in nusaybin farther along the border the kurdish peace and democracy party bdp mayor ayse gokkan gestures at the syrian town of kamishli partly under pyd control</s>
<s>when the kurdish flag was raised over kamishli thousands of locals took to the streets in celebration</s>
<s>“these borders are artificial for centuries we lived as one our hearts are one our aims are one our suffering is one” she sighs</s>
<s>at the bdprun mitanni cultural centre young kurds are making up for lost time performing dramas and songs in the most widely spoken kurdish dialect kurmanji</s>
<s>“independent maybe autonomy definitely” grins a teenager playing the role of hamlet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the pkk often seems less concerned with kurdish rights than with undermining the ak party</s>
<s>the rebels have escalated their violent campaign inside turkey killing scores of soldiers and policemen</s>
<s>and right across the southeast the pkk has embarked on a terrorist spree burning government buildings raiding schools wounding children and kidnapping teachers to weaken the state’s grip</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the fiercest fighting has been in the mountains around semdinli a town wedged between iran and iraq</s>
<s>cemil oter leader of the powerful jirki tribe which has fought on the side of the army against the pkk suggests that turkish rule over semdinli has become a polite fiction</s>
<s>mr oter once an ardent supporter of mr erdogan used to tell his people to vote ak</s>
<s>“he gave us more hope than any other turkish leader” acknowledges mr oter</s>
<s>but “now he has become just like the others we won’t vote for him again”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ak is the bdp’s sole rival in the region</s>
<s>it swept up half the kurdish votes in the southeast in 2007</s>
<s>in 2009 mr erdogan came tantalisingly close to peace first by taming turkey’s meddlesome generals and then by introducing reforms that gave the kurds greater linguistic and cultural freedoms</s>
<s>he also began secret talks with the imprisoned pkk leader abdullah ocalan in hopes of ending an insurgency that has cost nearly 50000 lives</s>
<s>but mr erdogan’s 2009 “kurdish opening” was closed after he was reelected last year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>critics claim that mr erdogan ditched the kurdish opening in a cynical bid to court nationalist votes that may carry him to the presidency when it becomes free in 2014</s>
<s>they also say his promises of a new democratic constitution will come to nothing</s>
<s>the government retorts that by stepping up its terrorist attacks the pkk has made it impossible to get the turkish public on board</s>
<s>even as turkish fighter jets rained bombs on pkk camps in northern iraq this week the government was unveiling textbooks for kurmanji classes in state schools</s>
<s>an official kurdishturkish dictionary is in the works and defendants will be allowed to speak kurdish in court</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet with each new concession the pkk keeps raising the bar</s>
<s>the rebels now insist they will not resume talks unless mr ocalan is moved out of solitary confinement and placed under “humane conditions” ie house arrest</s>
<s>hundreds of pkk prisoners have gone on indefinite hunger strike to this end</s>
<s>mr ocalan who is revered by kurds could yet be the key to peace</s>
<s>but after 13 years of solitary confinement his health is waning and so is his grip</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed as the pyk consolidates its hold in syria a solution seems to be slipping out of turkey’s hands</s>
<s>many believe that mr erdogan’s syrian policy especially his support for the opposition free syrian army is to blame</s>
<s>“they freed the border from assad only for the pkk to step in” says one opposition mp</s>
<s>moreover by seeking to oust mr assad turkey has antagonised his chief allies iran and iraq prompting them to rekindle their alliances with the pkk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the economic cost is also rising</s>
<s>turkey has lost an estimated $3 billion in annual trade</s>
<s>nusaybin a former hub for suitcase traders has been hit hard since its border with syria was sealed in december</s>
<s>shuttered shops line the streets</s>
<s>unemployment says mrs gokkan has rocketed to 90</s>
<s>with few prospects nusaybin’s youths are natural recruits for the pkk</s>
