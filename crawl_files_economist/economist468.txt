<s>not so long ago sheikh adnan alarour seemed like a gift to the syrian regime</s>
<s>keen to discredit the peaceful protesters who came out in march 2011 state media portrayed the greybearded preacher an exiled dissident whose fiery blasts beam across two saudiowned salafist satellite channels as a bigoted ghoul</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>especially damning was footage in which the sheikh rose shook a warning finger at the camera and vowed to “grind the flesh” of proregime alawites and “feed it to the dogs”</s>
<s>the government gleefully dubbed its foes “araeer” a taunting plural form of mr arour’s name insinuating they were just nasty sunni chauvinists out to destroy syria’s multisectarian harmony</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in truth mr arour a native of the syrian city of hama who fled after the regime’s brutal suppression of an uprising there in 1982 had few followers before syria’s current troubles</s>
<s>most activists were disturbed by any religious language that undermined what they saw as an inclusive secular street movement</s>
<s>the channels where mr arour has appeared devote most of their airtime to attacking shia islam</s>
<s>his dismissal of kurdish claims for greater autonomy risked alienating a valuable component of the antiregime front</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those who tuned in to mr arour’s weekly show were attracted less by his sunni triumphalism than by his theatrical appeals for all syrians to rise and fight something opposition intellectuals in exile neglected to do</s>
<s>but as syria’s misery has ground on sectarian fault lines have inexorably widened</s>
<s>mr arour’s views once widely dismissed as extreme now look closer to the mainstream at least among the threequarters of syrians who are sunni muslims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the sheikh’s recent return to the rebelheld swathe of northern syria where he starred at a rare gathering of commanders from rebel military councils showed how popular he is among the fighters</s>
<s>yet it is not just the surge in religiosity among syrian sunnis that gives him his cachet</s>
<s>mr arour has been a vociferous and effective fundraiser in the gulf</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rather than back the most extreme of the groups mr arour has now paired up with mustafa sheikh a secularleaning leader of the free syrian army and has spoken of a need to channel funding through military councils in order to reduce rivalry among the myriad rebel groups</s>
<s>criticising the involvement of foreign jihadists he has also denounced suicidebombings as criminal</s>
<s>and it has been claimed that his bloodcurdling video threat to alawites who comprise the core of the assad regime’s support is often taken out of context since he directed his meatgrinder rant only at those alawites who were actively suppressing the revolt any of them who stayed neutral he insisted should be protected as equal citizens</s>
<s>reassuring</s>
