<s>should scotland be an independent country or not</s>
<s>in negotiations concluded on october 15th david cameron secured the single inorout question that he wanted</s>
<s>but the choice facing scottish voters in 2014 and the campaigns to influence them will not be nearly as simple as the words on the ballot suggest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>john curtice a psephologist at strathclyde university says that scots divide into three roughly equallysized camps</s>
<s>the first lot want independence</s>
<s>the second prefer the status quo</s>
<s>a final group accounting for about 30 of those polled would like to stay in the union but also want more powers for scotland</s>
<s>in effect they are the swing voters</s>
<s>with two years to go until the referendum the campaigns are already converging on them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the separatist scottish national party snp will try to woo them by making independence seem trivial</s>
<s>the party has already underlined its enthusiasm for the queen the bbc the pound the bank of england’s interest rates and british optouts from irksome european union rules</s>
<s>its leader alex salmond talks of a “social union” between england and a newlyindependent scotland</s>
<s>but he will have a hard time convincing scots he can deliver these things</s>
<s>independent scottish participation in sterling eu optouts and the bbc are not and will never be in his gift</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unionists meanwhile are trying to convince scots that voting “no” would result in a hefty dose of new powers</s>
<s>on signing the referendum agreement mr cameron called on scots in favour of more devolution to vote to stay in the united kingdom</s>
<s>labour has launched a commission to draw up a new devolution package which will report next year and advance a final set of proposals in 2014</s>
<s>the liberal democrats have already proposed farreaching changes including a new federal structure for the entire union</s>
<s>under their plan scotland would raise about two thirds of the money it spends</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jeremy purvis of the pressure group devo plus hopes that the unionist parties’ schemes will coalesce in the runup to the referendum</s>
<s>he claims this will present voters with a clear set of commitments to feature in all three main parties’ manifestos for the 2015 election showing that a vote against separation is not a vote for the status quo</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if that happens much of the wind will be taken out of mr salmond’s sails</s>
<s>he may be a romantic caledonian nationalist but many snp voters and even some party members would be perfectly satisfied with the advanced devolution proposed by the unionist parties</s>
<s>nationalist hopes that a busy scottish cultural calendar in 2014 and participation by 16 and 17yearold voters will significantly boost the separatist turnout are optimistic at best</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so the referendum is forcing the snp to make concessions to the union while pushing unionists towards further devolution</s>
<s>the gap between the visions set forth by the two sides while roomy is shrinking</s>
<s>it now concerns questions of identity—citizenship flags titles membership of international organisations—more than retail politics</s>
<s>can scotland be sufficiently independent within the uk</s>
<s>unless mr salmond can persuade the average voter that it cannot the union is safe</s>
