<s>hurricane sandy at 900 miles across the largest tropical storm ever recorded in the atlantic hit new york and new jersey especially hard though damage was done in much of america’s northeast</s>
<s>that the loss of life was not far greater a hurricane that hit new england in 1938 killed up to 800 people owed much to the emergency response of the authorities with governor andrew cuomo of new york governor chris christie of new jersey and new york city’s mayor michael bloomberg to the fore</s>
<s>they were ably supported by the federal emergency management agency fema partially offsetting its ignominy in new orleans in 2005</s>
<s>yet the storm exposed vulnerabilities in the infrastructure of the selfstyled capital of the world which will need to be addressed before an even stronger hurricane blows its way as sooner or later it will</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in new york the hudson and east river breached their banks flooding manhattan streets and the ground zero memorial and filling the brooklynbattery tunnel which connects manhattan to 25m people in brooklyn with 43m gallons of water</s>
<s>the midtown tunnel which connects queens and manhattan was built to withstand flooding yet it flooded too as did significant parts of the subway which as one wag put it got a “onceinacentury clean”</s>
<s>runways at jfk and la guardia airports were submerged</s>
<s>more than 15000 flights were cancelled</s>

<s>an explosion in a waterdamaged transformer left much of lower manhattan without electric power probably for several days</s>
<s>when new york university hospital’s backup generator failed patients had to be evacuated in the middle of the hurricane including babies born prematurely who rely on respirators</s>

<s>much of the financial district was wet time for another wall street bailout said some and in the dark except for the headquarters of goldman sachs which thanks to a generator remained a beacon of light for global capitalism</s>
<s>ninety percent of homes in long island lost power too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the 1990s governor cuomo was head of hud the federal housing department in which role he encountered many disasters but nothing to match this</s>
<s>new york city’s damage surpassed that of hurricane andrew midwest floods and earthquakes in california</s>
<s>“what i saw” he said “were some of the worst conditions i have seen”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new jersey was in even worse shape</s>
<s>the seaside towns along the famous jersey shore were devastated the popular seaside heights resort was practically wiped out the amusement park on its pier torn to pieces</s>

<s>the full economic cost of sandy will not be known for years</s>
<s>the personal property claims will be significant</s>

<s>ihs has early estimates of total economic losses of $30 billion$50 billion about 117 of gross regional product grp in the states affected</s>
<s>in comparison hurricane katrina caused about $120 billion in damages 96 of grp for the impacted states</s>
<s>however reconstruction should serve as a ministimulus for the regional economy much as it did in florida following hurricane andrew in 1992</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>president obama quickly made fema funds available</s>
<s>too quickly for political reasons complained michael brown who disastrously headed the agency during katrina</s>
<s>this was if nothing else a reminder that a natural disaster does not always help a president look presidential george w bush notoriously praised “brownie” for doing “a heck of a job”</s>
<s>but sandy was the sort of october surprise that showed mr obama at his best and will help him in next week’s election</s>
<s>mr christie a popular straighttalking republican who has been campaigning for mitt romney had only good things to say about mr obama’s response to the storm at one point explaining that “i don’t give a damn about election day” while mr christie and mr obama rode together in marine one mr romney was left to help put together parcels for hurricane relief—in the swing state of ohio</s>
<s>fema’s response has made his crusade against big government harder to sustain in the final days of the campaign</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two winters ago mr bloomberg was embarrassed by being out of new york when a blizzard struck</s>
<s>since then he has made sure to get ahead of pending bad weather with last year’s hurricane irene evacuations proving a drierthanpredicted run for sandy</s>
<s>yet as with new orleans there have long been warnings of the dangers posed by a severe storm and recommendations to invest in better defences against surging tides have gone unimplemented</s>
<s>in 2011 a city hall report on the waterfront “vision 2020” strongly urged building lots of dykes and seawalls and floodproofing buildings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>other reports have recommended putting expensive movable barriers along the east river and the harbour to prevent flooding as london did on the thames three decades ago</s>
<s>mr cuomo wants levees built in lower manhattan and mr christie wants to rebuild his shore to protect the beaches and the towns</s>
<s>he accepts however that iconic things have washed away</s>
<s>still as he said the day after the storm “as long as sorrow doesn’t replace resilience we’ll be just fine”</s>
