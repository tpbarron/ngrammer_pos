<s>blondes are dumber and brunettes more dependable</s>
<s>or so it is said</s>
<s>but it is redheads who have long been the more feared revered loathed and loved hence the rumour that it takes more than an average dose of anaesthetic to sedate a carrottop</s>
<s>as sylvia plath herself a titian tigress of sorts once remarked “out of the ash i rise with my red hair and eat men like air”</s>

<s>man’s fascination with hair is almost as old as humanity itself</s>
<s>but humans have been cutting and coiffing their hair for at least 25000 years mostly with the aim of pleasing themselves and distancing or differentiating themselves from others</s>
<s>yves le fur curator of a new show about hair at the quai branly museum in paris is well aware that one of the earliest depictions of styled hair is a paleolithic figurine known as the venus of brassempouy which was discovered in southwest france in 1894</s>
<s>but he hides his anthropological light under a bushel and draws visitors into “cheveux chéris” with a quick tour d’horizon of stylists styles and styled from gina lollobrigida to ingres and the sirens of ulysses</s>

<s>having enticed the public in with the seductiveness of youthful locks mr le fur moves on to hair loss and the show takes a serious and far more interesting turn</s>
<s>middle age and chemotherapy are just two reasons why people lose their hair</s>
<s>though often painful at least privately this is loss via a gradual process and in the case of the latter is reversible</s>
<s>examples of voluntary and instantaneous hair loss include styling by punk rockers of the 1980s and the swastikashaped shavings of neonazi thugs</s>
<s>either way the visitor is reminded of what rapid hair loss has meant over time</s>

<s>a ponytail of three thick curls severed at the nape is all that remains after a young frenchwoman named emma surrendered to a carmelite convent</s>
<s>where today parents save first curls as a souvenir of babyhood in the 19th century it became fashionable to work the hair of a dead beloved into a locket bracelet or even a ring</s>
<s>one of the most touching pieces in the show is a small curl of blonde hair pasted onto a heartshaped piece of motherofpearl</s>
<s>it was cut from the head of louis xvi’s heir louischarles who was born just before the french revolution and died in the temple prison two years after his parents were guillotined having been put under the care of a shoemaker tasked with making him forget his royal origins</s>

<s>it should perhaps be obvious that such an exhibition in france would turn next to the second world war</s>
<s>but photographs of l’épuration a grisly moment at the time of the liberation when the country rose up against those suspected of being collaborators are still shocking</s>
<s>taking a cue from the “purification” of republican women in spain in the 1930s french women who had slept with the enemy were marched on to public squares and shaved</s>

<p>
<s>jeering crowds accompanied this public depilation adding to the stigma</s>
<s>a series of pictures taken by a magnum photographer robert capa in chartres in august 1944 just a week before the liberation of paris are a testimony threequarters of a century later to the hate curiosity shame and indifference of crowds</s>
<s>even more striking because it is so rarely seen is a montage of film clips of that time in which a group of women is trundled through the streets on a cart marked les poules à boche while a soldier chucks one of them under the chin</s>

<s>hair shorn on these occasions was never kept</s>
<s>in other civilisations the power of hair lay in its importance as a trophy believed to be infused with the strength or magic of its original owner</s>
<s>it is this appropriation of hair that mr le fur explores in the final section of the show</s>
<s>from peru to gabon and from india to china coats crowns and headdresses of human hair have been made for centuries</s>
<s>it is easy in these politically correct times to forget that similar practices were just as common in europe and america</s>
<s>the quai branly museum may be just six years old but it is in its way oldfashioned a throwback to a less timorous time when museums were proud to display human scalps and heads shrunken by amazon tribes pictured</s>
<s>by exhibiting such items and putting them in an historical context mr le fur has increased our knowledge and added to an exhibition that is hard to forget</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“cheveux chéris frivolités et trophés” “beloved hair trophies and trifles” is at musée du quai branly in paris until july 14th 2013</s>
