<s>just over three years ago akio toyoda then the new boss of toyota said that the carmaker founded by his grandfather was on the verge of “irrelevance or death”</s>
<s>buffeted by bad news ranging from the global economic crisis to product recalls and huge losses he responded not with a massive shakeup but a simple strategy to make cars that were fun to drive</s>
<s>from that he argued would follow sales and profits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it has not been an easy road since but the turnaround seems to be gaining traction</s>
<s>on november 5th toyota raised its net profit forecast for the current fiscal year to a fiveyear high of ¥780 billion $98 billion</s>
<s>that is well short of record profits but it contrasted with honda and nissan which slashed their profit forecasts by a fifth</s>
<s>all three have been hurt by slumping sales in china which is in a territorial row with japan</s>
<s>but toyota’s new hybrids as well as its corolla and camry models have been flying out of the showrooms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new bosses at sharp panasonic and sony must be looking at toyota enviously wondering how they too can rebuild japan’s image as a producer of snazzy hightech goods</s>
<s>jointly their companies are expected to have lost more in the past five years than they have made profits in the past two decades see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sharp is in the ugliest mess</s>
<s>the maker of tvs and solar panels is so sensitive about its balancesheet that on november 5th it revised a fourdayold announcement that had said there was “material doubt” about its future</s>
<s>the new version with no apologies for murdering the english language said “there exist conditions which might raise uncertainties about sharp being an assumed going concern</s>
<s>however we judge that no uncertainties about sharp’s ability to continue as a going concern will exist”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the same day standard  poor’s a ratings agency cut sharp’s creditworthiness further into junk territory</s>
<s>it said two years of huge losses were straining its finances added to which sharp was highly dependent on shortterm debt</s>
<s>two banks mizuho corporate and bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj recently provided it with a ¥360 billion syndicated loan but this expires next june just before a big convertiblebond issue comes due</s>
<s>sp said it might downgrade sharp again in 90 days if the company’s finances or its relationship with its banks worsens</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sp believes panasonic and sony have stronger balancesheets</s>
<s>but they are also suffering from chronic overinvestment in lossmaking tv and other screenrelated businesses that make them look too much like sharp for comfort</s>
<s>panasonic shocked its bondholders recently when it said it faced losses of over ¥700 billion for the second year in a row</s>
<s>it also skipped its annual dividend for the first time since 1950</s>
<s>sony meanwhile predicted a fullyear profit but said that much of its core electronics business remained in decline</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>is there anything they can learn from toyota</s>
<s>analysts say their industry is much more commoditised than carmaking</s>
<s>their empires are so thinly spread across an array of businesses that it is harder to cut costs through economies of scale</s>
<s>they are also too wedded to japan to move to cheaper manufacturing locations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet mr toyoda has one lesson to teach they could put more energy into making products that consumers enjoy</s>
<s>that’s what their competitors in south korea and at apple do</s>
<s>sadly they are too busy stanching the wounds of the past to give it much thought</s>
