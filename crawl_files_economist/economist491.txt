<s>africa’s “mobile decade” when telephones at last reached most corners of the continent has meant a huge improvement in the lives of the poor</s>
<s>but quantifying it is hard</s>
<s>how useful can a mobile phone be to someone living on less than $250 a day the world bank’s standard benchmark of poverty</s>
<s>researchers in kenya have given a partial answer</s>
<s>they find that people will skip a meal or choose to walk instead of paying for a bus fare so that they can keep their phone in credit</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the weekly value of these sacrifices averages just over 72 kenyan shillings 84 american cents—not a trivial amount seeing that the daily wage of a kenyan labourer can be as little as a dollar</s>
<s>the report by ihub an incubator for kenyan tech startups suggests that discretionary spending by the poor is now influenced greatly by their expenditure on mobile phones</s>
<s>interviews conducted at half a dozen spots around the country showed how fine are the margins in the decisions made by the poor</s>
<s>some would for instance forgo meat at meal time in the hope of making a call or sending an sms that would enable them to put more food on the table later</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>almost half of those surveyed were using internetenabled smart or “feature” phones</s>
<s>the scratch cards that many kenyans use to charge their mobiles have recently begun to advertise their value in terms of data rather than talk time</s>
<s>meanwhile mobilephone operators have been giving free access to sites such as wikipedia to entice customers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still only 16 of respondents said they were using their phones to browse the internet</s>
<s>the real breakthrough in the kenyan market has been in people’s ability to send and receive money with more than twothirds doing so by phone</s>
<s>east africa’s biggest success has been mpesa a mobilebased moneytransfer system pioneered by safaricom a leading kenyan operator</s>
<s>its simple interface which works on any phone has brought financial services to kenya’s poor majority enabling the movement of some $86 billion in the first half of this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but mpesa’s success has not escaped the notice of a government struggling to meet its financial commitments</s>
<s>the finance ministry plans to slap a tax of 10 on the fees charged by operators of mobilemoney transfers</s>
<s>this cost will inevitably be passed on to customers including the very poor thus—according to the gsma a global lobby of mobilephone operators—stifling an important source of development</s>
<s>but if kenya’s president mwai kibaki who is due to retire next year is mindful of his legacy he may refuse to let the bill pass</s>
