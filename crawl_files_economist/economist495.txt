<s>mounting the podium in london’s guildhall to receive her second man booker prize on october 16th hilary mantel mused on the delayed gratification of a writer’s life</s>
<s>“you wait 20 years for a booker prize and two come along at once” she joked</s>
<s>granting the award which attempts to single out the best novel published in the englishspeaking world to “bring up the bodies” raised some eyebrows</s>
<s>ms mantel won the trophy only three years ago for “wolf hall” the first book in what will be a trilogy</s>
<s>the new entry in the series beat more adventurous contenders including a novel about psychotherapy and modernism and the tale of a mumbai opium den</s>

<s>ms mantel’s recipe for handling the intrigue fear and opulence of life with a monarch by turns amiable sexaddicted and murderous is to ditch the subshakespearean prose which plagues much historical fiction</s>
<s>no one in her book says “fie thee sir” bodices remain unripped</s>
<s>we hear of sexual intrigue through the gossip of others and the prism of their interests</s>
<s>in this account of henry viii’s transition from wife number two anne boleyn to meek jane seymour the language is plain and pointed</s>
<s>“how many wives does the man want” muses thomas cromwell the exasperated chief minister combining raison d’état with the guileful selfinterest of the political aide</s>

<s>cromwell is the axis of the series</s>
<s>ms mantel has done much to rehabilitate a man rendered in “a man for all seasons” the popular 1960s film as a selfaggrandising control freak</s>

<s>historical novels resonate when they bring the past to life while nodding to the mood and concerns of the present</s>
<s>some critics have seen in “bring up the bodies” with its summary disappearances and the “sweat of fear” echoes of today’s anxieties about renditions of terror suspects and other state excesses</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>her subject matter is also commercially savvy</s>
<s>“wolf hall” was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic making more than £5m $8m for its british publishers</s>
<s>and to judge by the interest in biographies of henry’s court from writers like alison weir david starkey and antonia fraser as well as a lavishly tacky tv series chronicling the sex and violence of the inhabitants those wily tudors still command the imaginations of the second elizabethan age</s>
