<s>the arrival of the massproduced car just over a century ago caused an explosion of business creation</s>
<s>first came the makers of cars and all the parts that go into them</s>
<s>then came the garages filling stations and showrooms</s>
<s>then all sorts of other cardependent businesses car parks motels outoftown shopping centres</s>
<s>commuting by car allowed suburbs to spread making fortunes for prescient housebuilders and landowners</s>
<s>roadbuilding became a far bigger business whereas blacksmiths farriers and buggywhip makers faded away as america’s horse and mule population fell from 26m in 1915 to 3m in 1960</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now another revolution on wheels is on the horizon the driverless car</s>
<s>nobody is sure when it will arrive</s>
<s>google which is testing a fleet of autonomous cars thinks in maybe a decade others reckon longer</s>
<s>a report from kpmg and the centre for automotive research in michigan concludes that it will come “sooner than you think”</s>
<s>and when it does the selfdriving car like the ordinary kind could bring profound change</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just imagine</s>
<s>it could for a start save the motor industry from stagnation</s>
<s>carmakers are fretting at signs that smartphoneobsessed teenagers these days do not rush to get a driving licence and buy their first car as their parents did</s>
<s>their fear is that the long love affair with the car is fading</s>
<s>but once they are spared the trouble and expense of taking lessons and passing a test young adults might rediscover the joys of the open road</s>
<s>another worry for the motor industry is that car use seems to be peaking in the most congested cities</s>
<s>yet automated cars would drive nosetotail increasing the capacity of existing roads and since they would be able to drop off their passengers and drive away the lack of parking spaces in town might not matter so much</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cars have always been about status as well as mobility many people would still want to own a trophy car</s>
<s>these might not clock up much mileage so carmakers would have to become more like fashion houses constantly creating new designs to get people to swap their motors long before they have worn out</s>
<s>but cars that are driverless may not need steering wheels pedals and other manual controls and being virtually crashless most road accidents are due to human error their bodies could be made much lighter</s>
<s>so makers would be able to turn out new models quicker and at lower cost</s>
<s>fresh entrants to carmaking could prove nimbler than incumbents at adapting to this new world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all these trends will affect the car business</s>
<s>but when massproduced cars appeared they had an impact on the whole of society</s>
<s>what might be the equivalent social implications of driverless cars</s>
<s>and who might go the same way as the buggywhip makers</s>
<s>electronics and software firms will be among the winners besides providing all the sensors and computing power that selfdriving cars will need they will enjoy strong demand for incar entertainment systems since cars’ occupants will no longer need to keep their eyes on the road</s>
<s>bus companies might run convoys of selfpiloting coaches down the motorways providing competition for intercity railways</s>
<s>travelling salesmen might prefer to journey from city to city overnight in driverless winnebagos packed with creature comforts</s>
<s>so indeed might some tourists</s>
<s>if so they will need fewer hotel rooms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cabbies lorry drivers and all others whose job is to steer a vehicle will have to find other work</s>
<s>the taxi and carrental businesses might merge into one automated pickup and dropoff service gm has already shown a prototype of a twoseater batterypowered pod that would scuttle about town with passengers summoning it by smartphone</s>
<s>supermarkets department stores and shopping centres might provide these free to attract customers</s>
<s>driverless cars will be programmed to obey the law which means sadly the demise of the traffic cop and the parking warden</s>
<s>and since automated cars will reduce the need for parking spaces in town that will mean less revenue for local authorities and carpark operators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when people are no longer in control of their cars they will not need driver insurance—so goodbye to motor insurers and brokers</s>
<s>traffic accidents now cause about 2m hospital visits a year in america alone so autonomous vehicles will mean much less work for emergency rooms and orthopaedic wards</s>
<s>roads will need fewer signs signals guard rails and other features designed for the human driver their makers will lose business too</s>
<s>when commuters can work rest or play while the car steers itself longer commutes will become more bearable the suburbs will spread even farther and house prices in the sticks will rise</s>
<s>when selfdriving cars can ferry children to and from school more mothers may be freed to reenter the workforce</s>
<s>the popularity of the country pub which has been undermined by strict drinkdriving laws may be revived</s>
<s>and so on</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>getting there from here</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this may sound farfetched</s>
<s>but the selfdriving car is already arriving in dribs and drabs</s>
<s>cars are on sale that cruise on autopilot slot themselves into awkward parking spaces and brake automatically to avert collisions</s>
<s>motorists seem ready to pay for such features encouraging carmakers to keep working on them</s>
<s>the armed forces are also sponsoring research on autonomous vehicles</s>
<s>some insurers offer discounts to drivers who put a black box in their cars to measure how safely they drive as cars’ computers get better than humans at avoiding accidents selfdrive mode may become the norm and manual driving uninsurable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the first airline to operate a regular international schedule began in 1919 only 16 years after the wright brothers showed that people really could fly in heavierthanair planes</s>
<s>for those businesses that stand to gain and lose from the driverless car the future may arrive even quicker</s>
