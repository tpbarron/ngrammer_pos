<s>economic inequality can be measured in many ways—by the distribution of wealth income or consumption or between races sexes regions or individuals</s>
<s>the resulting picture can vary a lot</s>
<s>in america for instance the income gap between blacks and whites and men and women has narrowed over the past 30 years even as that between individuals has widened</s>
<s>disparities in consumption are always smaller than those in income because people save and borrow to smooth their living standards</s>
<s>the distribution of wealth is usually less equal than that of annual incomes</s>
<s>gaps in pretax income are larger than those in disposable income after taxes and government transfers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the main measures of economic inequality used in this special report are the gini coefficients for disposable income and consumption derived from household surveys</s>
<s>these surveys are now conducted in almost all countries</s>
<s>in the rich world and in latin america official gini coefficients are usually based on income</s>
<s>in asia and africa consumptionbased figures are more common</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>crosscountry comparisons can be tricky</s>
<s>inequality in india for instance is often said to be lower than in china</s>
<s>but china’s gini coefficient of 048 measures inequality of income whereas india’s official gini of 033 measures consumption</s>
<s>peter lanjouw and rinku murgai of the world bank calculated an income gini for india which at 054 is much higher than china’s and close to brazil’s</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another problem is that there are several international databases all slightly different</s>
<s>nor are household surveys good at capturing inequality at the very top not least because it is all but impossible to get the ultrarich to take part in them</s>
<s>the best information on the highest incomes comes from tax returns thanks to work pioneered by two french economists emmanuel saez and thomas piketty together with a briton anthony atkinson and an argentine facundo alvaredo</s>
<s>these four have built a huge database of top incomes which now includes 26 countries</s>
<s>their statistics go back much further than household surveys in america’s case to 1913</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gini coefficients and the top income share can paint different pictures</s>
<s>argentina’s gini for instance has fallen sharply over the past decade even as the share of income going to the top 1 has risen</s>
<s>germany’s gini has risen by 32 since the early 1980s but the share of income going to the very top has barely budged</s>
<s>one reason is that the statistics cover different people another is arithmetic</s>
<s>the gini aggregates all disparities so it is a better summary measure but it does not tell you where the gaps are growing</s>
