<s>six days after hurricane sandy passed through santiago cuba’s second city with a population of 500000 remained without power</s>
<s>running water in santiago where a cholera outbreak was reported earlier this year was scarce and there was a shortage of food</s>
<s>more than 115000 houses were damaged and 15000 destroyed</s>
<s>around 30 of cuba’s coffee crop was reported lost</s>
<s>thanks to a civildefence policy that insists on evacuation hurricanes rarely cause largescale loss of life in cuba</s>
<s>this time 11 people died—though that contrasted favourably with at least 52 in neighbouring haiti</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another difference with the past is that much of the information from the scene came from independent—and technically illegal—cuban journalists</s>
<s>the first reports of serious damage and deaths came from text messages in the city long before statecontrolled news announced the loss of life at the end of an evening broadcast almost 15 hours after the hurricane struck</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>increasingly cubans are able to gain access to such alternative news sources albeit indirectly</s>
<s>since 2008 when raúl castro the president allowed cubans to buy mobile phones their number has sextupled to 18m</s>
<s>internet access from mobile phones is still not allowed but users can broadcast text messages via twitter</s>
<s>internet connections at home are generally banned but resourceful cubans get around this by buying passwords from those such as doctors and academics who are allowed access</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this means that yoani sánchez cuba’s bestknown blogger has come to be seen by the authorities as the island’s most problematic dissident</s>
<s>a new law announced last month that will scrap a hated requirement for exit permits contains a clause allowing the government to continue to deny permission to travel abroad to anyone who seeks to undermine cuba’s communist political system</s>
<s>it was widely assumed to have been drafted with ms sánchez in mind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another recent reminder of the authorities’ difficulty in controlling information involved the health of fidel castro cuba’s former leader who is aged 86 and had not been seen since march</s>
<s>many outside commentators were surprised when he did not send a message of congratulation to hugo chávez his close friend and ally on his victory in venezuela’s presidential election on october 7th</s>
<s>twitter was flooded with rumours that fidel was dead or dying</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>someone decided that fidel had to reappear</s>
<s>news was leaked to the foreign press in havana that he had visited the city’s grandest hotel the nacional where he had been seen chatting to staff</s>
<s>the truth was less impressive</s>
<s>mr castro alive but very frail was driven to the hotel in a wheelchairfriendly minibus along with his wife and the visiting former vicepresident of venezuela elías jaua</s>
<s>a photograph was released of the group inside the vehicle together with the hotel’s manager who is a senior communist party member</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two days later an article by the former president was published in state media ironically entitled “fidel castro is dying”</s>
<s>in it he hit out at the foreign press for the stories about his health and said he felt fine but that cubans would hear even less from him in the future</s>
<s>he had decided that it was “definitely not my role” to take up media space that should be devoted to more important tasks</s>
<s>these presumably include combating the bloggers</s>
