<s>“warren is supposed to be for the middle class but i dunno” said one east boston resident as he watched elizabeth warren democratic candidate for the senate in massachusetts march past in the columbus day parade</s>
<s>and that is ms warren’s biggest problem convincing massachusetts voters especially workingclass ones that she is right for them</s>
<s>she is a professor and former bankruptcy lawyer</s>
<s>but scott brown the republican who in 2010 took the senate seat held for nearly 47 years by ted kennedy may have the edge in bluecollar appeal</s>
<s>he is wellliked in the state especially among fishermen who supported barney frank a democratic congressman who is retiring</s>

<s>even some labour unions support him</s>
<s>one poll shows mr brown ahead among union members by 46 to 41 and he is backed by the massachusetts municipal police coalition a police union</s>
<s>unlike many republicans he is not antiunion indeed as a former model he belongs to the screen actors guild</s>
<s>but many unions have endorsed ms warren including the aflcio the state’s largest</s>
<s>the union’s rank and file are knocking on doors for her</s>
<s>she also has the support of tom menino boston’s longserving democratic mayor who can get out the vote like no one else</s>

<s>both candidates are doing their best to appeal to workingclass voters raising some $60m to do it the most ever raised for a senate race in the bay state</s>
<s>neither has been shy about invoking their modest backgrounds</s>
<s>she the daughter of a caretaker became a harvard professor and later worked for the president</s>
<s>he had a traumatic childhood marked by hunger neglect and physical abuse</s>
<s>ms warren boasts that she fought for the consumer in washington</s>

<s>debates between the two have been heated</s>
<s>mr brown has attempted to cast doubt on ms warren’s claims of americanindian blood suggesting this was a ruse to get preferential treatment his staffers at a recent campaign event made tomahawkchops and war whoops though mr brown called their behaviour “unacceptable”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in campaign ads mr brown brags about his independence and his bipartisan leanings</s>
<s>his favourite supreme court justice is antonin scalia a conservative yet he may not support the conservative mitch mcconnell for majority leader if the republicans take the senate</s>
<s>“that’s the beauty of being independent” he says</s>

<s>according to a boston globe poll one in five votes is still up for grabs</s>
