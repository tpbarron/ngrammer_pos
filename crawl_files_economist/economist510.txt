<s>unbiased economic opinion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sir – so academic economists favour barack obama over mitt romney which you reasoned “may in part reflect partisan preference” because 45 of them say they are democrats “asking the experts” october 6th</s>
<s>your implication was that their views are biased by some sort of arbitrary allegiance perhaps akin to supporting a football team</s>
<s>but isn’t it more likely that academic economists view politics through the lens of their profession and by a huge margin have concluded that democrats produce better economic policy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is particularly striking given that running the economy sensibly is one of the chief claims of republicans</s>
<s>in practice however republicans have shown contempt for nonpartisan analysis pragmatism and facts</s>
<s>republicans have allowed grover norquist the influential head of a pressure group on tax to become the arbiter of all tax policy leaving themselves little scope for sensible reform</s>

<s>reporting on the maldives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sir – the commonwealth is not in the business of “rubber stamping” reports and certainly did not do so when it came to the transfer of power in the maldives this year “sunset cruise” october 6th</s>
<s>widespread concerns were expressed about the national inquiry into the change of president in february</s>
<s>after our engagement the commission of national inquiry was expanded and senior judicial experts from singapore canada and new zealand were added to it</s>
<s>its terms of reference were amended to ensure all relevant facts were considered and the commission’s investigative approach was adjusted to enable witnesses to testify in camera</s>
<s>the outcome was an internationally credible report that confirmed the constitutional legitimacy of the transfer of power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is not the end of the story</s>
<s>there were serious concerns about the behaviour of the police during the transfer of power which still need to be addressed adequately</s>
<s>the commonwealth is looking into this as well</s>

<p>
<s>sir – one of the sections in your special report on india september 29th considered how the country’s education policies are failing the workforce</s>
<s>women fare worst</s>
<s>the world economic forum ranks india 121st out of 135 countries on the divide between men and women in education a worse showing than tajikistan iran and saudi arabia</s>
<s>there is a big gap between enrolment and completion rates</s>
<s>twice as many girls as boys are pulled out of school or have never attended school</s>
<s>the literacy rate in india for women is only 51 compared with 75 for men</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>furthermore the labourforce participation rate for women is just 29 and most are employed in the agricultural or informal sectors</s>
<s>unless women are shifted away from lowskilled jobs to higher paid labour this potential source of human capital cannot contribute to india’s economy</s>
<s>education policy needs also to focus on keeping girls in school</s>

<s>sir – your special report was poignant and discerning—except with regards to india’s cities</s>
<s>you suggested that lavasa is a new city for “rich folk”</s>
<s>it is not</s>
<s>it is a prototype for how integrated and economically diverse cities can be built to make urban life attractive places for growth with better living for all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the controversy and delays involving lavasa like most urban problems in india occurred from a lack of good governance</s>
<s>with 300m indians expected to move from villages to urban areas over the next 30 years many new cities will be needed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sir – you barely mentioned the 833m residents of india’s 640000 villages</s>
<s>most are either landless or own the very small amounts of land on which they live</s>
<s>the politicalbusiness nexus in india that you wrote at length about makes it very easy for commercial organisations to remove people from land their families may have dwelled on for generations</s>
<s>this often occurs with little compensation and sometimes violence</s>
<s>when agricultural change and the industrial revolution in britain caused large numbers of people to move from the country to the towns at least there were jobs to go to</s>
<s>that is really not the case for those joining the huge numbers of impoverished people in india’s swelling towns</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>earlier this month 50000 very poor people from all over india began a 30day march from gwalior to delhi to call for land reform</s>
<s>the government is taking these demands seriously</s>
</p>

<p>
<s> sir – to help it “aim higher” india’s federal government should adopt the presidential model of a president directly elected by the people with strong executive powers</s>
<s>parliaments two houses the lok sabha and rajya sabha should be scrapped as they no longer function properly</s>

<p>
<s>sir – you gave credit to manmohan singh the current prime minister for liberalising the economy</s>
<s>but it was under narasimha rao in 1991 that india took the bold step of launching the reforms</s>
<s>mr singh was merely minister of finance at the time following the instructions of his boss</s>
<s>rao’s reforms were all the more bold given that his was a minority government</s>

<p>
<s> sir – you compared narendra modi pictured right of india’s bjp to barry goldwater because mr modi is “reshaping the country’s right wing but is too divisive to lead” goldwater opposed the democrats new deal new frontier and great society and he was a fierce opponent of communism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however he was also a true social libertarian supporting causes like gay rights and druglaw reform decades before other american politicians and he was known for his personal honour and kindness</s>
<s>mr modi’s odious connection to and casual dismissals of the 2002 riots in gujarat his past ties to the chauvinistic wings of the hindu nationalist movement and his embrace of the breadandcircuses economics that dominate indian politics makes it a disservice to compare him to the late father of contemporary american libertarianism</s>

<s>scott platton washington dc  you can bank on mexico</s>
</p>

<p>
<s> sir – we agree with most of the arguments you used to describe the sound situation of the mexican banking system “from tequila crisis to sunrise” september 22nd</s>
<s>but you gave readers the impression that bank lending rates in general are dramatically higher than the base interest rate of 45</s>
<s>it is important to note that more than 70 of the mexican bankingsystem’s loan portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 94</s>
<s>the average interestrate on creditcard portfolios is currently 26 as opposed to the 40 mentioned in the article</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally you said that “mexican banks have historically not been safe places in which to leave money lying around” banks in mexico in fact have been the safest place to keep money</s>
<s>since the 1910 mexican revolution not a sole depositor has lost a peso not even during the acute crisis in 1995</s>

<p>
<s>sir – as a fully paidup babyboomer i am fed up with the media’s portrayal of us as a selfish bunch of whiners who have soaked up state benefits with nary a care for the generations that will come after us “sponging boomers” september 29th</s>
<s>my husband and i have worked hard throughout our lives and raised three children who are all gainfully employed and like us also contribute their full whack in taxes</s>
<s>in fact i would argue that it is the present navelgazing generation of parents who are the most cosseted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>we had to juggle careers and childrearing without the perks of flexible employment hours extended maternity and paternity leave and the ability to “work” from home</s>
<s>why criticise us but ignore these egregious burdens on private companies</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>sir – i enjoyed bagehot’s take on boris johnson though the column october 13th didn’t quite capture the london mayor’s metaphorical mellifluence</s>
<s>boris has described female beachvolleyball olympians as “glistening like wet otters” epitomised tony blair as a “mixture of harry houdini and a greased piglet” and upset the fine citizens of portsmouth by portraying their town as “too full of drugs obesity underachievement and labour mps”</s>
<s>regarding his prospects of becoming the next prime minister boris once said that they were “about as good as the chances of finding elvis on mars or my being reincarnated as an olive”</s>
<s>i wonder if he still thinks that</s>
