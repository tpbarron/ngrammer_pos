<s>the parties to peacemaking in the middle east have dubbed 2011 the year of peace</s>
<s>israel the palestinian authority pa and the united states all announced in september 2010 that they hoped to wrap up a deal within a year</s>
<s>egypts president mubarak urging them on from the sidelines said if their talks went well it wouldnt matter if they took an extra month or two</s>
<s>that would bring us to the end of 2011—and great rejoicing the world over</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is no need to repeat the litany of disappointment that such prognostications have produced over the years</s>
<s>the scepticism is easily stated</s>
<s>american power is seen to be declining particularly in the middle east with the withdrawal through 2011 of the remaining american units from iraq</s>
<s>iran continues to bolster its surrogates on israels borders hizbullah in lebanon and hamas in gaza</s>
<s>it continues too its march towards nuclear weapons despite americanled sanctions</s>
<s>the pa leadership—president mahmoud abbas and salam fayyad the prime minister—is politically weak</s>
<s>israels prime minister binyamin netanyahu is strong but many feel he is unwilling to use his strength to face down the hardliners in his own camp</s>
<s>some believe he is at heart still one of them</s>

<p>
<s>go back a decade and start again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nevertheless new hope has crept into the 2011 prognosis</s>
<s>the obama administration seems to have decided to make israelipalestinian peacemaking the showcase of its resolve to stay engaged in the middle east</s>
<s>the president and his secretary of state hillary clinton have invested personal prestige in getting the two sides to sit together—and stay seated</s>
<s>with the whole of 2011 available before he is sucked into presidential campaigning mr obama seems intent on giving his peacemaking the quality time it needs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sensing this moderate arab leaders like egypts mr mubarak king abdullah of jordan and tentatively as always the saudi royals and their gulf allies have rallied around the american initiative</s>
<s>their worry over iran is as acute as israels</s>
<s>they look to america to prevent a nuclear iran rather than risk israel launching an attack there</s>
<s>they will lend mr abbas the arab support he needs to withstand opposition from hamas and from within his own fatah movement as the talks with israel proceed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr netanyahu for his part is moving belatedly along the trajectory from diehard to pragmatist drawn by his predecessors ariel sharon and ehud olmert</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a reason for hope is that all three negotiators—the americans will continue to be active—are inching back towards the “clinton parameters”</s>
<s>that blueprint for peace devised a decade ago by president bill clinton provides for israel to annex settlements close to the old west bank border and the jewish suburbs it has built in east jerusalem</s>
<s>these would be swapped for unsettled territory elsewhere which would become part of the new palestinian state</s>
<s>the parameters were accepted by the labour government in israel under ehud barak today mr netanyahus minister of defence</s>
<s>they were rejected by yasser arafat the palestinian president</s>
<s>more wasted years followed when israelis and palestinians obtusely failed after 2005 to broaden ariel sharons unilateral withdrawal from gaza into a comprehensive peace</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with the border question sorted out early the sting would be drawn from the settlement issue</s>
<s>the israelis could build on the land that would eventually be theirs</s>
<s>agreement on borders would make it easier to agree on jerusalem itself</s>
<s>the clinton parameters envisaged palestinian sovereignty on the haram alsharif where the mosques of omar and alaqsa now stand</s>
<s>that might lead the pa to accept an accord on palestinian refugees</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the lost first decade of the millennium could be redeemed in one year of gutsy negotiating</s>
<s>for mr abbas it will require the courage to accept what his stillvenerated predecessor rejected</s>
<s>for mr netanyahu it will mean dumping some of his coalition partners and perhaps too some of his own likud loyalists</s>
<s>he commands the parliamentary arithmetic to form a coalition with tzipi livnis party kadima</s>
<s>she and many in her circle were raised in the likud</s>
<s>they moved with mr sharon to an acceptance of the palestinians right to statehood</s>
<s>their secession shattered the likud</s>
<s>mr netanyahu painstakingly rebuilt it</s>
<s>it will be hard for him to split the party again</s>
<s>but there may be no other way</s>
