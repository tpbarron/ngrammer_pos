<s>in 2009 david bahati a backbench member of parliament in deeply conservative uganda drew up a bill that proposed the death penalty for hivpositive gay men and prison for anyone failing to turn in homosexuals</s>
<s>his proposals have been watered down but not before prompting a surge in the homophobia and vigilantism that lie at the heart of an affecting new documentary “call me kuchu”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when the film begins a local tabloid newspaper rolling stone has printed the names and addresses of 100 kuchus gay and transgender people under such headlines as “homo terror</s>
<s>we name and shame top gays in the city”</s>
<s>it is here that the viewer first meets david kato pictured a sweet but resilient activist and uganda’s first openly gay man</s>
<s>he is suing the newspaper</s>
<s>“if we keep on hiding” he says “they will say we’re not here” kato is joined by fellow kuchus stosh who endured a “corrective” rape and naome his best friend</s>
<s>theirs is the human story behind the headlines</s>
<s>meanwhile the smarmy newspaper editor is almost unwatchable in his eagerness to harness the growing bigotry</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in exploring how much of this debate has been driven by religious leaders the filmmakers katherine fairfax wright and malika zouhaliworrall maintain a careful balance footage of a visiting american evangelical group battling the “homosexual agenda” is interspersed with that of a staunch gayrights supporter a controversial ugandan bishop christopher senyonjo</s>
<s>ubiquitous billboards quoting the bible appear alternately ominous and benign</s>
<s>but it is kato’s brutal murder a year after the film started being made that breaks the mood of polite evenhandedness</s>
<s>officially his death is recorded as a burglary gone wrong</s>
<s>no one really believes that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“call me kuchu” is too raw and urgent to be called artful filmmaking</s>
<s>but its message rings loud and clear</s>
<s>life for gay people in uganda—as in much of africa—is not just dangerous it is deadly</s>
