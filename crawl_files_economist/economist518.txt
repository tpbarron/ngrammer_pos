<p>
<s>vivek wadhwa’s new book “the immigrant exodus” is admirably short yet he packs it with righteous fury</s>
<s>america he points out has one of the greatest assets a nation can have people yearn to live there</s>
<s>chinese students indian doctors british actors and french financiers flock to its shores</s>
<s>what is more america is very welcoming and always has been</s>
<s>its universities brim with foreign brains</s>
<s>its zippiest companies are powered by immigrants</s>
<s>some stay for ever</s>
<s>others work for a while and return home where they often continue to swap ideas and do business with their american friends</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a nation that can attract the cleverest people in the world can innovate and prosper indefinitely</s>
<s>unless it does what america has done since september 11th 2001 which is to make the immigration process so slow unpredictable and unpleasant that migrants stay away</s>

<p>
<s>consider the story of puneet arora who came to america in 1996 to study medicine</s>
<s>he won a fellowship at the prestigious mayo clinic worked for a while as a doctor in a deprived area and ended up as medical director at genentech a giant american biotech firm</s>
<s>mr arora is clearly the kind of citizen that any sensible country would be delighted to have</s>
<s>yet america kept him waiting 16 years for a green card which grants permanent residency</s>

<p>
<s>life in immigration limbo is wretched</s>
<s>immigrants on h1b visas which are issued to skilled workers must be sponsored by a specific employer</s>
<s>they cannot change jobs without imperilling their application</s>
<s>their careers stagnate</s>
<s>they do not know whether they will be deported so they hesitate to put down roots buy a house or start a company</s>
<s>sometimes their spouses are barred from working</s>
<s>in some states their spouses cannot even obtain a driving licence as if they were female and living in saudi arabia</s>
<s>fewer and fewer talented people are prepared to put up with such treatment and they have plenty of other options</s>
<s>they know that canada australia and singapore hand out visas swiftly and without fuss</s>
<s>if they are from a poor country they know that there are opportunities back home</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr wadhwa’s finds are alarming</s>
<s>since no nationality may receive more than 7 of employmentbased green cards chinese and indian applicants are treated more harshly than citizens of less populous nations</s>
<s>the time they must spend in limbo has shot up</s>
<s>if they have a great idea for a new company they can go home and start it straight away</s>
<s>in america if they quit their day job they may be deported</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a survey mr wadhwa found that most indian and chinese students in america expect problems in obtaining a work visa when they graduate regardless of the demand for their skills</s>
<s>an unprecedented number now plan to go home</s>
<s>mr wadhwa believes that immigration policy has halted the surge in hightech firms founded by immigrants and possibly reversed it</s>
<s>in silicon valley the proportion of hightech startups they founded has fallen from 52 in 2005 to 44 this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“the immigrant exodus” is packed with examples of opportunities squandered for want of a visa</s>
<s>hardik desai for example persuaded hardnosed investors to put $300000 into his startup which made diagnostic technology</s>
<s>but he could not persuade the immigration authorities to let him work for his own company without proving that it could pay his salary for a long time—something almost no new firm can prove</s>
<s>so he had to shut it down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr wadhwa who is himself of indian origin moved to america from australia back in the days when it was easy</s>
<s>working as a computer scientist he received a green card in 18 months and went on to found two hightech companies</s>
<s>he laments that if the conditions when he first arrived had been as they are today “i would have been a fool to leave australia” by locking out foreign talent america has “blocked the flow of its very lifeblood” he argues in this wise and powerful tract</s>
<s>yet the problem is simple to solve</s>
<s>mr wadhwa lays out a sevenpoint plan that can be summarised in three words let them in</s>
