<s>a stream of headlines about bailouts teetering banks and high unemployment has repelled investors from europe’s struggling periphery</s>
<s>that did not stop investindustrial a privateequity group with a focus on spain and italy from this week buying the 50 stake it did not already own in portaventura an amusement park near barcelona</s>
