<s>all mayors like to think that the arrival of the olympic flame in their city is an epochshaping event</s>
<s>in boris johnsons case a lot more hangs on the sporting festivities than a feelgood mood with a bit of infrastructure investment thrown in</s>
<s>these may be britains olympics but in political terms theyre boriss launchpad</s>
<s>the tousled figure who runs london has ambitions to run the rest of britain too—and 2012 will decide whether that dream might come true</s>

<s>when the newspaper columnist associated with the eurosceptic end of toryism ran against the labour oldstager ken livingstone in 2008 he was seen as plummy and prone to gaffes</s>
<s>now he is one of the bestknown politicians in the land—widely referred to by his first name and vastly more popular than other top tories</s>
<s>his achilles heel could be a string of extramarital dalliances 2012 had better be a year of restraint on that score</s>
<s>the olympics give him an international platform and one from which he can as a strategist puts it “move from celebrity to statesman” while projecting his own vision of a postcameronian conservatism</s>

<s>first he has to win his second term as mayor in may—and happily mr livingstone is past his electoral sellby date and does not look like a man with the energy to wrest back the mayoralty he held from 2000 to 2008 </s>

<s>but mr johnsons reelection bid takes place at a time when spending cuts will be biting and britains coalition government will be in the doldrums of public support</s>

<p>
<s>for one thing he is promigration he himself has angloturkish heritage and a new york birthplace and will speak out strongly against the present immigration cap</s>
<s>as the argument rumbles on about britains high toptax rate—mr cameron will keep the 50 rate—mr johnson will appeal to the city by railing against it as a defender of london as a global financial centre</s>
<s>on londons riots he struck a more even tone than the prime minister condemning the participants but acknowledging that the citys poor need support</s>

<p>
<s>likeability can go a long way too</s>
<s>and the conservative party likes tallpoppy winners and is all too aware that mr cameron did not secure the last election outright</s>
<s>armed with a mayoral win successful games and an international profile mr johnson would be wellpositioned to reenter parliament</s>
<s>that would poise him to run for the leadership should mr cameron lose in 2015</s>
<s>and even if mr cameron prevails his rival will be wellplaced to succeed him many of the prime ministers supporters believe their man will stand down before the end of a second term</s>
