<s>despite its slowdown china is still likely to be the fastestgrowing big economy this year</s>
<s>but what will be the zippiest economy big or small</s>
<s>according to the imf libya’s economy will grow by an astonishing 122 this year</s>
<s>that would be one of the fastest years of growth anywhere in the past three decades see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this remarkable statistic highlights the resilience of libya’s economy</s>
<s>it also illustrates the limitations of growth as a yardstick of economic progress</s>
<s>one sure route to stunning growth is first to engineer a stunning contraction</s>
<s>libya’s gdp shrank by over 60 in 2011 according to the country’s central bank as rebels and loyalists vied for control of the country’s oilfields</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>gdp is a measure of income not wealth</s>
<s>it gauges the flow of economic activity in a country not its stock of productive assets</s>
<s>in the aftermath of war a country will be left with an obvious and urgent need for rebuilding</s>
<s>reconstruction may lift gdp growth</s>
<s>but that should not obscure the horrendous loss of wealth</s>
<s>a broken window as frédéric bastiat a 19thcentury economist pointed out is good for the glazier’s trade</s>
<s>it does not follow that breaking windows or rebuilding cities after hurricanes for that matter is a route to prosperity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spectacular booms follow horrendous busts for statistical reasons too</s>
<s>a sharp contraction of gdp means that subsequent growth will be calculated from a much smaller base</s>
<s>it takes growth of 100 to undo a contraction of 50</s>
<s>even if libya’s economy grows by 120 in 2012 its gdp will be no bigger than it was in 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>libya’s growth this year is not however the fastest in the imf’s database which covers 186 countries and goes back to 1980</s>
<s>it is pipped by equatorial guinea a spanishspeaking country of 720000 people on west africa’s coast</s>
<s>its secret was not war but oil</s>
<s>in august 1996 its offshore zafiro field came onstream producing about 75000 barrels a day by the end of 1997</s>
<s>gdp grew by almost 150 that year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fast growth in that and other years has depleted the country’s natural assets</s>
<s>output from zafiro peaked in 2004 leaving the country “eager to start production from new finds” according to america’s energy information administration</s>
<s>other assets are also in jeopardy</s>
<s>under its kleptocracy asset recovery initiative america’s department of justice says it is chasing some of the baubles accumulated by the president’s son including more than $18mworth of michael jackson memorabilia</s>
