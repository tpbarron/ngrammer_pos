<s>russian gas had a bad year in 2009</s>
<s>its share of the european market shrank with demand weak customers were able to switch to cheaper suppliers</s>
<s>but the kremlin will once again be on the front foot in 2010</s>
<s>its top priority will be to get work started on the nord stream pipeline which will link russia to germany along the baltic seabed bypassing troublesome transit countries such as ukraine and poland</s>
<s>russias debtridden gas giant gazprom lacks the money to build this so it needs help from the european union and germany</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>russias heavyhanded energy diplomacy is often counterproductive</s>
<s>but it is lobbying hard for nord stream and will probably be successful</s>
<s>in 2010 it will increase pressure on sweden and finland both of which have raised environmental concerns</s>
<s>it will also call on support from its most powerful european ally germany</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>germanys reelected chancellor the canny angela merkel privately dislikes the project</s>
<s>but she knows she cannot block it outright germanys energythirsty industry is desperate to have a reliable supply of gas from the east</s>
<s>instead she will push for a compromise</s>
<s>germany will get nord stream built—if necessary with money from the european union</s>
<s>but it will also push hard for work to start on another pipeline nabucco</s>
<s>this would connect the gasrich caspian region with central europe via turkey and the balkans</s>
<s>russias alternative pipeline across the black sea south stream will get nowhere</s>
<s>it is too expensive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>tying up the loose ends on nabucco will be the main energy story in southern europe in 2010</s>
<s>turkey needs to be brought fully on board</s>
<s>that will mean its agreeing to take some russian gas from blue stream the underused pipeline across the black sea</s>
<s>putting russian gas in nabucco dilutes its importance as a counterweight to russias monopoly on eastwest gas supplies</s>
<s>but it is better than nothing</s>
<s>it will allow gas from kurdistan in iraq azerbaijan and other sources to reach europe directly for the first time</s>
<s>the eu is determined to get nabucco built even if the deal behind it is imperfect</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>russia has another pipeline to play with opal</s>
<s>this would connect nord stream to the centre of germany</s>
<s>in 2010 it will be clear that the czech government has signed up to this too so long as the pipeline route crosses a small bit of czech territory en route to southern germany the government in prague will not object</s>
<s>that leaves slovakia and ukraine literally out in the cold</s>
<s>russia will be able to drive a much harder bargain with these transit states once its supply route to powerful western countries is assured</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it will be a similar story for oil</s>
<s>by the end of 2010 russia will be able to close down the illnamed druzhba “friendship” pipeline built to carry soviet oil to the western half of the kremlins empire</s>
<s>instead russian crude oil will be carried by tankers from a new port being built at ustluga near st petersburg</s>
<s>that is bad and expensive news for countries such as hungary with oil refineries dependent on the druzhba pipeline</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with friends like these</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the kremlin will not have it all its own way</s>
<s>russias gas production crippled by corruption and bad management is falling</s>
<s>as domestic and export demand recovers it will be painfully clear that russia does not have enough gas to satisfy all its customers</s>
<s>this will result in rapid price rises for countries with no alternative to russian supplies and more embarrassing announcements about delays to prestige projects such as the underwater shtokman field off russias northwestern coast</s>
<s>russias clumsy use of energy blackmail in past years has spurred many european countries to diversify albeit belatedly</s>
<s>refineries that once took only russian oil such as lithuanias mazeikiai nafta will start experimenting with supplies from other countries</s>
<s>it may be expensive and technologically more difficult</s>
<s>but it increases these customers bargaining power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the weakest link in the west will be britain which has left it too late to build new nuclear power stations before its existing ones are decommissioned</s>
<s>unease or even panic will spread in 2010 as consumers digest the prospect of much higher energy bills blackouts or both</s>
<s>the likely outcome is a “dash for gas” such power stations are quick and relatively cheap to build</s>
<s>but where will the gas come from</s>
<s>the gasmen in the kremlin are licking their lips</s>
