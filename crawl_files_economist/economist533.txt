<s>jammed onto a spit of land that juts into the azure atlantic near the centre of recife in brazil’s northeast brasília teimosa was until a couple of decades ago a favela of wooden fishermen’s huts</s>
<s>now its streets are lined with brick houses some of three stories and clad in decorative tiles but others jerrybuilt</s>
<s>it has seafood restaurants shops and a couple of bank branches but also piles of uncollected rubbish</s>
<s>many marketing types and economists would hail its residents as members of brazil’s burgeoning “new middle class” who have become avid consumers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is not how francisco pinheiro a community leader who was born in brasília teimosa sees it</s>
<s>“economically it’s much better off than it was” he says</s>
<s>“but a middleclass person is someone who lives in boa viagem”—a smart beachfront residential suburb close by—“with a car an apartment and an income of 3000 reais $1500 a month” in brasília teimosa he adds the majority earn less than two minimum wages $613—often shared among a family of four or more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as it happens mr pinheiro’s finelytuned sense of social class fits neatly with the definitions deployed by the world bank in a groundbreaking new study</s>
<s>having crunched the numbers from household surveys across the region it reckons that latin america’s middle class expanded by 50 from 103m to 152m between 2003 and 2009</s>
<s>that represents extraordinarily rapid social progress</s>
<s>but it means that only 30 of the region’s population is middle class see chart</s>
<s>a larger group has left poverty but only just as have many of those in brasília teimosa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what it means to be middle class is a matter of definition and debate</s>
<s>sociologists and political scientists define the middle class according to education occupational status and ownership of assets</s>
<s>economists by contrast tend to see income as determining class</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bank’s economists nod in the direction of sociology by defining the middle class in terms of economic security</s>
<s>they reckon that for a latin american household to have no more than a 10 chance of falling back into poverty over a fiveyear period requires an income of at least $10 per person per day at purchasingpower parity exchange rates</s>
<s>they define those with an income of over $50 per day—just 2 of latin americans—as rich</s>
<s>the bank calls those with a daily income of between $4 and $10 “the vulnerable” or the “lowermiddle class”</s>
<s>they make up the largest group</s>
<s>the proportion of latin americans living in poverty—defined as a daily income of less than $4—has fallen from 414 in 2000 to 28 in 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this social progress is the result of a rare combination of faster economic growth low unemployment and falling incomeinequality</s>
<s>income per person in latin america grew at an annual average rate of 22 between 2000 and 2010 a step up from the previous two decades</s>
<s>and income inequality fell in the same period in 12 of the 15 countries for which data are available though latin america continues to rival southern africa as the world’s most unequal region</s>
<s>redistribution through conditional cashtransfer schemes and other social programmes has helped to reduce poverty</s>
<s>but most of the expansion in the middle class has come from faster growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in all the bank reckons that two in five latin americans were upwardly mobile between 1995 and 2010 though few made the leap directly from poverty to the middle class</s>
<s>those who moved up tended to have more years of schooling</s>
<s>but the bank cautions that latin america remains a land of unequal opportunity children whose parents had few years of schooling tend similarly to be less educated than their middleclass peers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one ray of hope is that over the past 15 years the average number of years of school attendance among young latin americans has increased sharply reducing the educational gap generated by social class</s>
<s>but the difference in the quality of the schools attended by the rich and the poor is bigger in latin america than anywhere else</s>
<s>higher education is expanding too and tends to be a passport to the middle class</s>
<s>but its cost—not least in job income foregone—deters poorer students making student loans vital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>size matters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some other recent studies have argued that latin america’s middle class is much bigger than the bank finds</s>
<s>a 2010 study by the oecd a group of mainly rich countries reckoned that 275m people in the region—or just under half the population—were middle class</s>
<s>the oecd used a relative definition counting all those whose income was between 50 and 150 of the median</s>
<s>but the median income varies widely across latin american countries making it hard to put together a regional picture</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>marcelo neri a brazilian economist has argued that the middle class now makes up more than half his country’s population</s>
<s>like many brazilian analysts he divides society into five groups and shows that the middle group “class c” has grown from around 35 of the population to about 50 since 1990</s>
<s>class c is defined as those with daily incomes between $610 and $2620</s>
<s>many of them are in the bank’s “vulnerable group”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why does this debate matter</s>
<s>firstly because most people would agree that it is better to be middleclass than poor</s>
<s>turning her country into “a middleclass society” is one of the oftenstated goals of dilma rousseff brazil’s president</s>
<s>secondly it is widely assumed that a bigger middle class brings a more cohesive and stable democracy less prone to populism and more intolerant of corruption</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the political implications of latin america’s growing middle class are not yet clear</s>
<s>some commentators have argued that the “new middle class” is entrepreneurial is partly drawn from the informal sector and will be hostile to statism and high taxes</s>
<s>in fact the bank finds that the middle class tend to be salaried employees of private companies</s>
<s> some of them send their children to private schools that have sprung up in many oncepoor communities</s>
<s>but other voices dissent</s>
<s>andré singer a brazilian political scientist argues that rather than a new middle class the rise in incomes and jobs of the past decade has produced “a new proletariat” drawn from people who were previously too poor to constitute a coherent social class</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>augusto de la torre the world bank’s chief economist for latin america points out that the middle class could form a constituency that pushes the state to provide better quality services</s>
<s>or it could choose to opt out of state services which could worsen as a result</s>
<s>that matters if the growth of the middle class is to be sustained</s>
<s>keeping up the progress will require the right public policies</s>
<s>as the boost from high commodity prices and the global liquidity glut ebbs sustaining economic growth will demand more reforms warns mr de la torre</s>
<s>preventing the “vulnerable” from slipping back means helping them remain in work with training and information programmes</s>
<s>creating equality of opportunity requires investment in better schools and health care</s>
<s>but in many latin american countries though not brazil and argentina taxes are too low to provide goodquality services</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>encouraging though latin america’s social progress is sustaining it is vital</s>
<s>as francis fukuyama a political scientist at stanford university has pointed out it is too early for latin america to count these gains as permanent</s>
<s>“for a true middleclass democratic consensus to emerge this group needs to constitute a clear majority of the population” he argues</s>
<s>otherwise it may be tempted to ally with the rich to block reform</s>
<s>but at least latin america is half way there</s>
