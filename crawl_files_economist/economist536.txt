<s>“a place beyond belief”</s>
<s>this is the message of an art installation unveiled in pristina kosovo’s capital on september 11th</s>
<s>the meaning of the structure pictured planted between the city’s unfinished serbian cathedral and its university library is open to interpretation—as is the event the unveiling was supposed to mark the end of “supervised independence” for the country</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when kosovo declared independence in 2008 part of the deal with the new country’s western backers was that its authorities would submit to the supervision of an international civilian office</s>
<s>for the country’s government the closure of the ico on september 10th was reason to celebrate full independence</s>
<s>others including a major opposition party insist that it is much ado about nothing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the truth lies somewhere in between</s>
<s>the ico certainly has some successes to show for its work</s>
<s>it has helped keep kosovo stable and push through legislation mandated by the independence plan drawn up by martti ahtisaari a former finnish president and nobel peace prize laureate</s>
<s>the body oversaw for instance the setting up of new municipalities which give serbs in south and central kosovo some control over their own affairs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the ico failed in other ways</s>
<s>it was unable to reduce corruption and could not incorporate kosovo’s north which is inhabited by serbs who still object to independence as does serbia itself</s>
<s>as a result the government has essentially no control over the area</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>jeta xharra a prominent kosovar journalist reckons that the ico fulfilled 70 of the tasks it was set but tolerated corruption in exchange for cooperation over issues between kosovo’s ethnic groups</s>
<s>in the north it made small advances which may bear fruit in the longterm</s>
<s>but during its mandate it lacked the muscular backing of the european union or america required to make real progress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unsurprisingly many kosovars are unmoved by both the closure of the office and the end of supervised independence</s>
<s>foreign judges remain in their country as does the eu’s police and justice mission points out ardian arifaj of kipred a local thinktank</s>
<s>what is more kosovo’s security is still guaranteed by a natoled peacekeeping mission</s>
<s>a ghostly united nations mission also remains</s>
<s>diplomats in particular american ones still wield influence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and yet the decision to close the ico taken by its creators is a sign of confidence in kosovo</s>
<s>in a few weeks the european commission is also likely to recommend that the country is ready to begin talks on a stabilisation and association agreement—the first step in what would be a lengthy march towards eu membership</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the meantime diplomats are trying to come up with a format for a new round of talks between kosovo and serbia on relations between the countries and the situation in the north</s>
<s>alas it is unlikely that these will lead to an agreement that solves all outstanding issues</s>
<s>the best one can hope for says robert wilton the ico’s former head of policy is some form of modus vivendi</s>
<s>given the region’s gruesome recent history that would not be such a bad outcome</s>
