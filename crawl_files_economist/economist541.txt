<s>like doctors seeing the first heartbeat in a cardiac patient europe’s financiers have cheered recent signs of life in bankfunding markets</s>
<s>yet the celebrations may be premature</s>
<s>the recovery in funding markets has been uneven smaller banks are not benefiting as much as bigger ones</s>
<s>and for the giants the improvement may reflect the perniciously persistent belief among bondholders that some banks are still too big to fail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two indicators in particular have got better recently</s>
<s>the first is that banks have been able to issue bonds with relatively long maturities in currencies such as dollars that until recently were denied them</s>
<s>several banks including spain’s bbva and france’s bnp paribas and société générale have sold dollardenominated bonds in recent weeks reopening a funding market that had been closed for about 18 months</s>
<s>the market for eurodenominated bonds reopened at the start of this year but with banks still paying over the odds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a second and more significant gauge of banks’ health is the tumbling costs of borrowing</s>
<s>banks’ funding costs have fallen below those of investmentgrade european corporations for the first time in three years see chart</s>
<s>“this is fundamentally a good direction of travel” says huw van steenis of morgan stanley</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this crossover is important because the business model of many large banks is undermined if they have to pay more to borrow on bond markets than their clients do</s>
<s>capital markets provide banks with a vital source of finance that allows them to lend more than they collect in deposits and to match the maturity of assets and liabilities better</s>
<s>freezes in bond markets also threaten financial stability because banks may not be able to issue new bonds to pay back existing obligations that are coming due</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the revival of wholesaleborrowing markets is due almost entirely to the actions of central banks across the rich world</s>
<s>the european central bank’s provision of threeyear loans to banks under its two longterm refinancing operations in late 2011 and early 2012 reduced the risk of solvent banks collapsing because they could not borrow</s>
<s>its more recent pledge to buy unlimited quantities of european government bonds has reduced the risk of peripheral countries such as spain being forced out of the euro area</s>
<s>the quantitativeeasing policies of the federal reserve and bank of england have also helped by forcing down yields on american and british government bonds and encouraging investors to look for higher yields elsewhere</s>
<s>that has sparked huge issuance and buying of corporate bonds and in turn driven their yields so low that investors have since piled into bank bonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the recovery in bankbond issuance has been confined mainly to banks in core european countries or to the biggest european banks in peripheral ones</s>
<s>smaller banks such as italy’s banco popolare and unicredit bank austria a subsidiary of a large italian bank recently cancelled planned bond sales after they were unable to attract enough interest from investors</s>
<s>“anything below the level of a national champion has little to no access to the market” says a senior investment banker</s>
<s>“essentially the market is betting that the national champions will be supported by governments or the central bank because they’re too big to fail”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this divide is a worrying one</s>
<s>weaker banks faced with higher borrowing costs are cutting back on loans and assets</s>
<s>in some cases this is welcome several bond traders say that spanish banks have been selling down their holdings of government bonds</s>
<s>but in many cases they are cutting lending to small businesses stymying economic recovery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as troubling is the idea that bondholders are betting on an implicit government subsidy for larger banks which could allow them to grow at the expense of smaller ones</s>
<s>it is unreasonable to ask policymakers to worry about the longterm side effects of their medicine while banks are still in surgery but today’s cure may well be the source of tomorrow’s ills</s>
