<s>keen western investors call myanmar the final frontier</s>
<s>that neatly captures the excitement of placing a bet on the last big country in booming asia to open up to the outside world</s>
<s>after the ending of most economic sanctions against a country that was a byword for repression they are ready to embrace the opportunities in a land of 60m people tucked handily between india and china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet despite an ongoing transition to democracy risks abound</s>
<s>the judiciary is as rickety as the ancient british bangers that still lurch around downtown yangon</s>
<s>the financial system is just as archaic</s>
<s>a big hope has been that new investment legislation will bring some clarity and order</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the law was at last ratified by president thein sein on november 2nd after months of wrangling between the cabinet and a newly emboldened parliament</s>
<s>a final verdict on the legislation must await the government’s official english translation which could take months to appear</s>
<s>unofficial translations suggest that this law is only a modest step forwards</s>
<s>it sends the important message that the government is committed to welcoming foreign investors</s>
<s>but the regulatory environment will stay almost as murky as before</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new law is at least a victory for the reformers in government</s>
<s>diehard army officers and their cronies in parliament had been trying to use the legislation to protect their privileged positions in the economy</s>
<s>in the end they lost most of the battles</s>
<s>under the new law any investment in myanmar can be up to 100 foreignowned</s>
<s>foreign investors will also get a fiveyear tax holiday and 50year land leases extendable by another 20 years giving them a degree of longterm security</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>certainty and clarity to wouldbe punters is nevertheless still in short supply</s>
<s>robert san pe an angloburmese lawyer argues that the myanmar investment commission will have “too much discretion” to rule on whether investments comply with hazily worded guidelines</s>
<s>its members will be chosen by the government and the commission may operate with little oversight democratic or otherwise</s>
<s>it will have to report to parliament only twice a year</s>
<s>this could be a recipe for corruption and arbitrary decisionmaking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr pe also frets there is “still no confidence on resolving disputes in the burmese courts and outside” the judiciary has lots of problems such as too few welltrained lawyers</s>
<s>but fears about a legal quagmire for investors could easily be allayed if for instance myanmar acceded to international arbitration agreements</s>
<s>it has not yet done so</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new law is an advance but foreign cash is unlikely to gush into the country</s>
<s>too much of myanmar’s legal and financial landscape is still shrouded in fog</s>
<s>and then there is the possibility of a radical change of government—whether through a coup by antireformers or through a victory by aung san suu kyi’s national league for democracy in the general election planned in 2015</s>
