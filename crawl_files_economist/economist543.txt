<s>something big is happening to the business of making things</s>
<s>those who want to understand it are unlikely to find a better guide than peter marsh</s>
<s>a writer for the financial times owned by pearson a partproprietor of this newspaper he has spent many years visiting factories that make useful things in clever ways</s>
<s>his observations are sharp and his book is a useful corrective to those who associate the word “manufacturing” with “decline”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>global industrial output was 57 times greater in 2010 than it was in 1900</s>
<s>in other words manufacturing has grown far faster than the overall economy</s>
<s>the main reason for this is that factories keep getting smarter in ways that hair salons do not</s>
<s>now says mr marsh the world is on the cusp of another industrial revolution driven by several new technologies</s>
<s>advances in electronics biotechnology and the internet are accelerating</s>
<s>so is the pace at which innovative ideas spread and are combined with each other</s>
<s>the volume and variety of goods soars even as prices tumble</s>
<s>mr marsh estimates that the world’s factories crank out some 10 billion different products each year</s>
<s>in other words there are more unique products than there are people</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even this huge number will one day seem paltry if the trend towards “mass customisation” continues</s>
<s>advances in computeraided design and threedimensional printing will allow firms to make products that are individually tailored to each customer—in order to produce precisely the tool you want or a prosthetic leg that fits perfectly—for little more than the price of a massproduced one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another big change is that manufacturing has gone global</s>
<s>this does not mean as some fret that production has all moved to chinese sweatshops</s>
<s>it means that any firm anywhere can hook up to a global supply chain</s>
<s>a product may be designed in one country and assembled in another using components from dozens more</s>
<s>even a small local manufacturer can use the best suppliers the world has to offer</s>
<s>every ipad dishwasher or garden spade you buy contains the expertise of thousands of specialists you will never meet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>manufacturers form a giant ecosystem</s>
<s>mr marsh explores its lesserknown nooks such as poole an english resorttown which is home to the world’s two biggest makers of air spindles</s>
<s>these in case you did not know are small electric motors whose shafts rotate on bearings made of gas molecules</s>
<s>they are essential in the production of printed circuit boards</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the geography of manufacturing is complex</s>
<s>supply chains are global but firms that make similar things cluster together like those spindlemakers in poole</s>
<s>mr marsh explains why proximity speeds the interchange of knowhow</s>
<s>a manager in warsaw indiana home to a dense cluster of medical implantmakers describes how an engineer can phone a subcontractor to discuss an idea and then “five minutes later he can call round to show how the product should be made</s>
<s>it’s a lot easier to do that kind of thing here than if the businesses were thousands of miles apart” mr marsh’s policy prescriptions are presented as an afterthought but no matter</s>
<s>his book buzzes—much like the chainsaws that felled the trees on which it is printed</s>
