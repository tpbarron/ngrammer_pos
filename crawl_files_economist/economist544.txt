<s>for the past three years the vast cap of shiningwhite ice covering the arctic has melted away in summer to an area that would have been unbelievable just a decade ago</s>
<s>at the end of the winter the frozen seas cover 157m square kilometres 61m square miles an area more than one and a half times that of the united states</s>
<s>by september the ice regularly used to melt to 7m square kilometres</s>
<s>but since a great collapse in 2007 the figure has been closer to 43m square kilometres</s>
<s>every summer an extra area of ice six times the size of california has been disappearing</s>
<s>as well as this reduction in area scientists believe that hidden beneath the surface the ice is growing ever thinner setting up the arctic for another sudden catastrophic collapse</s>
<s>the big question now is when the ice will disappear totally each summer</s>
<s>there will be an answer in 2010</s>

<p>
<s>another year of observations better computer models and—the holy grail of ice scientists—maps of the thickness of the ice from a new european satellite called cryosat2 should reveal in 2010 how long the arctic ice has left</s>
<s>estimates range from 2013—terrifyingly soon—to 2050 for the first year when the arctic is free of ice in summer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when that happens it will be the biggest and fastest change to the earths surface ever made by human influence</s>
<s>the ice poised between freezing and melting is an especially sensitive indicator of the planets temperature</s>
<s>when it disappears it will be a disaster for all the arctic life that depends on ice from the polar bears that walk on it to the tiny creatures that live within it</s>

<p>
<s>and it will be a disaster for the planet</s>
<s>that great dome of ice reflects sunlight back into space throughout the 24 hours a day of polar summer sunshine</s>
<s>when it turns seadark and soaks up the sun global warming will really take off</s>
