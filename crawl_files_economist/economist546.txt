<s>necessity so the proverb has it is the mother of invention</s>
<s>and science is nothing if not inventive</s>
<s>so as conventional sources of money get harder to tap the success rate enjoyed by those applying for research grants from the national institutes of health america’s biggest sciencefunding agency has fallen from 30 in 2003 to 18 in 2011 some of science’s more creative minds are turning elsewhere</s>

<p>
<s>philanthropic sponsorship of science particularly in the form of expensive pieces of kit such as large telescopes or sponsorship for expeditions to faroff places has been around for centuries</s>
<s>but the internet now permits what might be thought of as microphilanthropy</s>
<s>through a technique called crowdfunding in which members of the public donate small sums to projects they like the look of sometimes in the knowledge that the donation will be taken up only if sufficient other pledges are made to surpass a stated target the possibility of scientific philanthropy has been extended to those of more slender means</s>

<p>
<s>on october 4th for example ethan perlstein a pharmacologist at princeton university launched a bid on a site called rockethub to collect $25000 to study the effect of drugs such as methamphetamine on the brain</s>
<s>he has until november 18th to raise the money</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>kristina killgrove an anthropologist at the university of west florida has already raised over $12000 on rockethub to examine the dna of roman skeletons</s>
<s>and on another crowdfunding site petridish the california academy of sciences cas offered to name any new species of ant discovered during a conservation project in madagascar after those who donate more than $5000 to the enterprise</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although the crowdfunding of science is not raising the sorts of sums sometimes attracted by those with ideas for things like video games it has already spawned a couple of specialised platforms of its own</s>
<s>petridish is one</s>
<s>another is called microryza</s>
<s>and academic institutions are starting to follow the lead taken by the cas</s>
<s>the university of california san francisco has made a deal with a site called indiegogo that will allow the university’s charitable status to make money donated via indiegogo tax deductible</s>
<s>it will launch the first such project later this month</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>donors can expect no revenue if a crowdfunded science project is successful of course</s>
<s>but they can expect to be kept up to date with progress</s>
<s>dr perlstein has promised to upload all data from his experiments onto a website for his sponsors to look at</s>
<s>and even those who are not immortalised in the myrmicine literature as the cas proposed may still get a warm glow from the feeling that they are making a contribution to the advancement of knowledge in a way which was previously open only to philanthropists with rather fatter wallets</s>
