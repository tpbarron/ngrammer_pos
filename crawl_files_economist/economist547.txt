<s>if all goes as expected on november 15th xi jinping will walk out from behind a curtain at the great hall of the people as general secretary of the communist party of china trailed in order of rank by probably six other men the members of the elite politburo standing committee that will rule china for the next five years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>behind the curtain the mechanics of power that produce this spectacle remain a mystery</s>
<s>mr xi may be first among equals but he will have to share power with even more people and interest groups than did his predecessor hu jintao</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no one knows if mr xi were he to have a free hand would pursue the kind of broadreaching reforms that even some within the party believe are necessary to overcome mounting social economic and political challenges</s>
<s>but he will not have a free hand</s>
<s>accommodating those different interests within the opaque upper echelons of the party will mean a dilution of his power that does not bode well for the possibility of ambitious reforms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr xi and mr hu have surely influenced the makeup of the new politburo and its standing committee</s>
<s>but so too it appears has the man who preceded both of them as party chief 86yearold jiang zemin</s>
<s>rumoured to have been at death’s door not long ago mr jiang still seems to be playing a powerful role</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>beijing is buzzing with political gossip about rivalries and factions</s>
<s>little of the speculation is reliably informed</s>
<s>for more than 20 years chinese leaders have tried to institutionalise governance of the country but when it comes to choosing their leaders the most crucial decisions still come down to a small number of men whose influence is not always commensurate with their titles</s>
<s>the expected reduction in membership of the standing committee from nine to seven people is supposed to help the smaller group work better together as a “collective leadership”</s>
<s>but it could as easily have the opposite effect of alienating factions who will find other ways to exert influence—among them the heads of large stateowned enterprises senior figures in the people’s liberation army and other retired leaders</s>
<s>many of those elder statesmen appeared prominently on stage at the opening of the party congress on november 8th</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr jiang himself pointedly positioned front and centre see picture on the previous page provides an instructive case study</s>
<s>he clearly learned from the man who promoted him in 1989 after the crushing of demonstrations in beijing</s>
<s>deng xiaoping operated as paramount leader even after he retired from the last of his posts that year</s>
<s>it was deng who in 1992 designated mr hu as mr jiang’s successor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no one suggests that mr jiang has anything approaching the charisma or authority of deng but he has proved to be a canny operator and the upper ranks of the party and military are now populated with men who owe their careers to him alongside those who owe their careers to mr hu</s>
<s>the presence of these and other competing influences suggests that any attempt at radical reform is highly unlikely in the near future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr jiang’s influence looks set to linger</s>
<s>his protégés and putative allies populate the 24member politburo from which the members of the new standing committee are expected to be drawn</s>
<s>whereas mr hu has just one protégé certain to make the new lineup—li keqiang the presumptive new prime minister—most lists of possible new standing committees feature several members aligned with mr jiang</s>
<s>these include zhang dejiang party secretary of chongqing yu zhengsheng party secretary of shanghai and zhang gaoli party secretary of tianjin</s>
<s>joining them on one such list are liu yunshan chief of propaganda and wang qishan a vicepremier</s>
<s>other contenders viewed as more open to reform are now rated as longer shots for promotion</s>
<s>none of those tipped for china’s elite ruling body is known to be a radical reformer</s>
<s>but given how little has changed in chinese politics it is unclear whether any senior leader on the standing committee or not deserves such a label</s>
