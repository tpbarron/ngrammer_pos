<s>poland’s centrist government is being battered on all sides</s>
<s>growth is slowing unemployment remains high and a combination of austerity and scandal is stoking public discontent</s>
<s>jaroslaw kaczynski leader of the opposition law and justice party has gained a new lease of life</s>
<s>a rally this autumn drew a large crowd and several opinion polls put his party in the lead</s>

<p>
<s>shortly after donald tusk’s civic platform won the 2011 election he started some brave unpopular reforms and the fiscal tightening that his economically liberal supporters had long hoped for</s>
<s>particularly controversial was a decision in may to raise the retirement age</s>
<s>some economists were pleased but as the pain of austerity bit the government began sliding in the polls</s>
<s>scandals began erupting a cronyism affair involving civic platform’s junior coalition partner a collapsed pyramid scheme that entangled mr tusk’s son and claims of negligence or worse in the aftermath of the smolensk air crash in 2010 which killed mr kaczynski’s twin brother lech the then president</s>

<p>
<s>in response to the poll upsurge for mr kaczynski mr tusk is now slowing the pace of reform and is talking of spending more money</s>
<s>he has promised an investment splurge on railways roads power plants and the shalegas industry</s>
<s>mr tusk also wants to extend paid maternity leave to one year a counterbid to mr kaczynski’s offers of bigger family support</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr tusk is also steering poland through an awkward spell in its relations with the european union</s>
<s>as a big country waiting to adopt the euro poland has plenty to lose if the euro zone integrates in a way that lets countries with the common currency dictate policy to outsiders or makes it harder for them to join later</s>
<s>some think mr tusk should propose a threetier europe</s>
<s>this would create an inbetween “associate membership” of the euro zone for countries such as poland that have been working hard to meet the criteria for membership but are wary of joining until the euro crisis is over</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time mr tusk is using his good reputation in brussels and his strong ties with the german government he is often spoken of as a potential president of the european commission to haggle for a bigger chunk of the eu budget for 201420 see charlemagne</s>
<s>a senior official in warsaw says poland has secured wide support for a deal that would get it at least €72 billion—about €45 billion more than in the current budget period</s>
<s>another notes proudly that mr tusk’s team has put agricultural subsidies on the negotiating table despite poland’s enjoyment of them hitherto on the basis that they do less for growth than other “structural” funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the polish economy is still a bright spot</s>
<s>it is the only one in the eu to have avoided recession</s>
<s>convergence with germany continues apace</s>
<s>the central bank has been more worried about inflation than deflation raising interest rates in may though it may put them down again</s>
<s>the government expects the economy to grow by 22 in 2013—a low rate by recent polish standards it was 43 last year</s>
<s>but that is still faster than in most other eu countries</s>
<s>the budget deficit has been cut from 79 to an estimated 35 this year</s>
<s>for a while it was cheaper to buy default insurance for polish than for french debt</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the next general election is still three years away</s>
<s>law and justice is talking of a technocratic government to lead poland’s recovery</s>
<s>but despite mr tusk’s midterm unpopularity it is hard to see him go before the next elections in 2015</s>
<s>he may also get a helping hand from his rival mr kaczynski has blown his chances in the past</s>
