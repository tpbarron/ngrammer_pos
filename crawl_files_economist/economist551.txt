<s>for african governments it is clear that aid flows will go down in 2010 and dramatically so</s>
<s>donor governments have slashed their aid budgets and with most facing unfavourable demographic shifts and large deficits to depend on their largesse is no longer sensible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the good news is that the bond markets offer a real opportunity for africas governments to be serious about financial discipline and transparency—and to escape from the yoke of aid</s>

<p>
<s>the trend in asset allocation among the largest pools of international investment money suggests 2010 will mark a revival in african bond issuance</s>
<s>although over the past 20 years investors have been overweight in equities asset allocation is now tipping in favour of fixedincome bonds</s>
<s>even at the retail level flows into fixedincome funds have recently been in the order of five times more than into equity funds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the drop in outstanding consumer and industrial loans made by european and american banks has been more than offset by the increase in corporatebond issuance over the past year demonstrating the strong demand for fixedincome products</s>
<s>if anything the equity rally on low trading volumes since the spring of 2009 has masked this important trend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>greater demand for bond products will contribute to credit spreads tightening across most bond assets</s>
<s>at some point soon the more traditional western fixedincome products will look expensive offering little upside for the investor</s>
<s>so it will be logical for investors to widen their search to the “frontier markets” of africa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover if inflation picks up in 2010 so will commodity prices improving the creditworthiness of african governments</s>
<s>at the same time sovereignwealth funds especially chinas will want to diversify away from western markets</s>
<s>the result will be more debt issuance across africa</s>
<s>the fact that relatively lowrated credits such as the government of venezuela and the eurasian development bank have been able to raise large amounts of longduration money at competitive rates is a further signal that there is appetite for similarly rated african credits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today 19 subsaharan african governments have recognised credit ratings</s>
<s>yet only a handful have accessed the internationaldebt capital markets over the past two decades</s>
<s>this is bound to change in 2010</s>
