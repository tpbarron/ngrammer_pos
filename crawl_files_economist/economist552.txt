<s>the car industry has been suffering the effects of the global economic crisis more than most</s>
<s>so profoundly in fact that it is being compelled to rethink its business model completely</s>
<s>every crisis makes us discard our traditional way of looking at things</s>
<s>this one is forcing us in this direction but with the added complexity long overdue of environmentally focused solutions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as far as the product is concerned the innovation required in a period of crisis is not to invent something different</s>
<s>rather it is to adopt a different approach to cease viewing the automobile as a standalone object and begin seeing it as a component in a much larger system</s>
<s>the industry has already been developing more fuelefficient engines and other solutions which are more respectful of the environment</s>
<s>fiat group has embraced this path with the lowest average co2 emission levels among the top brands in europe</s>
<s>however to make a true leap we have to see this as a common challenge for the whole industry and for politicians</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>natural gas provides an eloquent illustration</s>
<s>today it is the only real immediate alternative to petrol</s>
<s>it is the most ecofriendly fuel available in nature the cheapest for customers—costing 30 less than diesel and half the price of gasoline</s>
<s>yet in europe use of naturalgas vehicles is derisory</s>
<s>one weak link in the chain can negate many of the advantages that innovation offers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>three key factors will enable our industry to make the necessary changes investment creativity and courage</s>
<s>even then the pursuit of new technologies is not without risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take hydrogen for example</s>
<s>for many years it was presented as a panacea to environmental problems</s>
<s>our industry was accused of not putting enough effort into developing these alternative engines</s>
<s>maybe in the future—in my view the distant future—we will all travel using hydrogen power</s>
<s>but until we find a sustainable solution to stockpiling the fuel it will remain an illusion we will merely be shifting the problem elsewhere</s>
<s>it may provide us with superclean cars but we would also have enormous quantities of energy and polluting emissions linked to producing the hydrogen itself on our conscience</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even with electric propulsion systems certainly one of the most promising technologies a distinction needs to be made</s>
<s>for those countries which depend heavily on electric energy that is imported or produced from oil mass use of electric vehicles is not necessarily advantageous for the system as a whole</s>
<s>a courageous action would be to seize the opportunity to base our entire system on the development of renewable energy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>i believe that even in the automotive field public authorities can play an important role in building the future</s>
<s>in america president barack obama formed an industryfocused task force whose mission is to transform the crisis into an opportunity</s>
<s>the aim is to influence an entire industry and the habits of consumers while providing safeguards for the industry and promoting the shared objective of reduced emissions and fuel consumption</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>american vision v european division</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in europe too many governments have given support to the sector each in its own way</s>
<s>this has taken the form of incentives to stimulate demand channelling it towards more ecofriendly alternatives as well as direct financial support for domestic producers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the objective for both america and europe seems the same to revitalise vital industries</s>
<s>but there is a real possibility that the results will be drastically different</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the american plan focuses on overcoming problems that have afflicted the automotive industry for years and on building a more sustainable future from both an economic and an environmental perspective</s>
<s>european plans by contrast are not addressing the underlying causes because they lack a common vision</s>
<s>individual states are acting unilaterally out of selfinterest rather than in the interests of europe as a whole</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in europe the industry faces another major impediment excessive regulation</s>
<s>that clearly represents a burden for carmakers as it will increase production costs</s>
<s>but the most troubling aspect is that these rules often produce no concrete benefits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consider the european unions regulation to reduce co2 emissions in new cars</s>
<s>it will cost carmakers a staggering €45 billion $67 billion a year while reducing co2 emissions by only 00015 a year—a ridiculously small percentage with an absurd costbenefit ratio</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>my point is that technological evolution must also be viable in relation to the evolution of the market</s>
<s>great crises can accelerate change</s>
<s>they provide the opportunity to confront structural problems with determination and speed but only if we accept these actions as inevitable and necessary</s>
<s>creating the conditions for virtuous change is the real challenge of our times</s>
