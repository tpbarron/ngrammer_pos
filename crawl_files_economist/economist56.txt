<s>carbon monoxide gets a bad rap</s>
<s>the gas produced by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons causes hundreds of deaths every year by poisoning and sends many thousands to hospital</s>
<s>most of these are the result of leaking cooking and heating equipment but the colourless odourless and tasteless substance known to chemists as co has also aided many a suicide</s>
<s>most horrifically nazis used it in gas chambers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there is more to the “silent killer” as co is sometimes called</s>
<s>it is produced by many cells in the human body where its molecules play a crucial role in activating enzymes involved in controlling the dilation of blood vessels and thus blood flow</s>
<s>mice in which the gene for producing the compound has been knocked out develop faulty organs and die young</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>exploiting this insight researchers have successfully used co to treat a number of ailments in lab animals</s>
<s>these include pulmonary hypertension an otherwise incurable disease in which thickened arteries obstruct the flow of blood leading to heart failure</s>
<s>the gas can also keep inflammation in check in particular after organ transplants</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reason human patients have so far been unable to benefit from any of this is co’s gaseous nature which makes it difficult to deliver in the right amounts to the parts of the body that need it</s>
<s>the problem is exacerbated by co’s narrow “therapeutic index” pump too little in and it won’t work but overshoot and it causes harm by binding irreversibly to haemoglobin making less of that substance available to carry oxygen around the body</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>frederick montgomery and duncan bathe think they have come up with a way to hit the sweet spot</s>
<s>their cokecansized gizmo which they devised while working at ikaria an american drug firm that both have since left contains a cartridge of pressurised co a tube to deliver the gas to the patient’s nose and a few buttons to set the required dose</s>
<s>a sensor connected to a nozzle at the end of the tube constantly measures the patient’s breathing rate and adjusts the amount of co dispensed with each breath</s>
<s>safety features including automatic shutdown if anything seems amiss are meant to eliminate the risk of co overdose and ensure that none leaks out endangering others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>scientists at another american pharmaceutical company sangart meanwhile have been encasing the gas—or strictly speaking coferrying haemoglobin—in a polymer pouch</s>
<s>kim vandegriff and her colleagues have been using polymer wrappers a mere nanometre a billionth of a metre across</s>
<s>these can be designed to break open only where their payload is needed</s>
<s>early trials have shown promise in treating sicklecell anaemia a disease caused by a faulty haemoglobin gene</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unlike most drugs co is not broken down by the body</s>
<s>instead once its job is done it is transported to the lungs and exhaled</s>
<s>as a result it produces no sideeffects</s>
<s>given the right dose then it can heal silently too</s>
