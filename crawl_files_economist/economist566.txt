<s>after a neardeath experience the biggest banks in the west are breathing more easily</s>
<s>life has been good to the survivors of the global financial crisis especially those who escaped state ownership and it will get better in 2010 despite tighter regulation and a blast of muchneeded competition</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2010 we will witness the emergence of a banking superleague comprising goldman sachs jpmorgan chase and deutsche bank</s>
<s>each will have the liquidity and appetite to dominate capital markets</s>
<s>these toobigtofail titans will be joined by barclays long seen as an accidentwaitingtohappen but now poised for a comeback</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barclays will reap the benefits of two audacious gambles made at the height of the financial crisis the purchase of the american operations of lehman brothers if only barclays had scooped up asia too and the decision to snub british state aid in favour of private investors notably from the gulf</s>
<s>an independent barclays powered by its investmentbanking arm will command a place in the superleague despite weaknesses in its british loanbook exposed by a stillfragile economy</s>

<p>
<s>yet life for the superleaguers will become tougher</s>
<s>in 2009 the leading “bulgebracket” banks generated easy profits and handsome bonuses buying and selling government bonds under central banks quantitative easing qe and other stimulus measures</s>
<s>in 2010 these trades will fade away just like qe itself</s>
<s>regulation will tighten as higher capital requirements are put in place</s>
<s>competition will return too in investment banking especially for talent</s>

<s>after two years of convalescence the walking wounded bank of americamerrill lynch citigroup and ubs will slowly be on the mend</s>
<s>they spent most of 2009 on the sidelines as regulators fretted about their capital ratios and dud assets</s>
<s>in 2010 the playing field will start to level out as lending recovers slowly and investment banks are weaned off emergency lifesupport systems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the return to quasinormality will challenge upstart corporate brokers and smallcap investment bankers such as jefferies and londonbased evolution</s>

<p>
<s>but a semblance of normality will not mean a return to the spellbinding leverage of the credit bubble</s>
<s>the days of easy pickings for hedge funds and their sponsor banks which traded creditderivative insurance and other exotic debt instruments are over</s>
<s>but leverage will return and the securitisation market will be open for business albeit in a more sober form</s>
<s>this will change the financial landscape in several ways</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first reduced leverage and tighter credit will herald the end of the privateequity model of the past 20 years</s>
<s>this was epitomised by kkrs “barbarians at the gate” takeover of rjr nabisco the foodtotobacco conglomerate which was stripped down and sold off</s>
<s>private equity will shift to older models of longterm funding for small and mediumsized businesses epitomised by 3i and alchemy capital albeit without the charismatic jon moulton</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second large privateequity players such as blackstone kkr and carlyle though bloodied will continue to engage in leverage provided they have committed capital</s>
<s>those raising capital will still find it hard even if lending picks up</s>
<s>meanwhile liquid hedge funds such as citadel will muscle in on private equitys patch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third expect a shift to private wealth managers at the expense of supermarket banks which stuffed clients with poorly performing funds courtesy of bernard madoff and aig bonds</s>
<s>the shift will offer opportunities for the private swiss banks despite no letup in the americanled campaign to water down swiss confidentiality established families such as the flemings and even hedge funds such as glg arguing that they can manage money better</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>risk will continue to be redefined in 2010</s>
<s>one of the effects of the financial crisis was to kickstart the corporatebond market to help companies refinance</s>
<s>the demand for “risk mitigation” will gain pace with more focus on clearing mechanisms independent valuations and certainty in settlement to stop rogue traders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and here we come to the bittersweet irony</s>
<s>having spent the past couple of years worrying about derivatives as “financial weapons of mass destruction” regulators and investors such as warren buffett will have to accept that these hedging instruments are here to stay</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>governments will hedge against inflation still a risk after the fiscal and monetary expansion to combat the crisis</s>
<s>pension funds will hedge against longevity increasingly important in planning for an ageing population</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a return to normality in 2010</s>
<s>not quite</s>
<s>more like a return to sensible risk management</s>
