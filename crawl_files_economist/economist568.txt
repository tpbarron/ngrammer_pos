<s>in 1997 dma design a british developer launched the first version of “grand theft auto” an enormously successful video game in which players routinely steal cars</s>
<s>they would be unlikely to come up with the idea now</s>
<s>in 1997 some 369000 vehicles were stolen in britain last year the number was just 94000</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that much is familiar</s>
<s>but graham farrell a criminologist at loughborough university believes the drop in car theft helps to explain why overall crime rates have fallen since the mid1990s—and not just in britain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>car theft he argues is an opportunistic “debut crime” which can start a criminal career</s>
<s>those who steal cars for fun often go on to become burglars or muggers</s>
<s>and mr farrell points out that a stolen getaway car is often necessary to commit serious crimes such as armed robbery</s>
<s>technology that makes it harder to steal a car such as vehicle immobilisers and central locking thus reduces the number of career criminals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is just one of many competing explanations for the decline in crime in rich countries that began in the 1990s</s>
<s>but mr farrell’s has the advantage of crossing borders</s>
<s>it may explain for example why crime started falling later in canada than in america immobilisers were not mandated in canada until 2007</s>
<s>that some other crimes have risen such as mobile phone theft and internet fraud supports the idea that a lot of criminal activity is opportunistic</s>
<s>and it makes intuitive sense too as players of “grand theft auto” know it is hard to get anything done without a car</s>
