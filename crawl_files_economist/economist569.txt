<s>they finished one apparently selfimposed task and immediately turned to another and with massive consequences</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as victoria glendinning shows it was hyperactive adults like these who hacked an empire out of the jungles of asia</s>
<s>in defiance of the maxim of his east india company bosses “trade not territory” raffles jousted for british supremacy against the dutch in the far east founded the future citystate of singapore and where his writ ran freed slaves banned cock fighting supported smallpox vaccination drives and abolished cruel punishments</s>

<s>officials of the east india company splutter in furious exchanges of letters about their salaries or job titles</s>

<s>olivia died within ten years of her marriage to raffles</s>

<s>by then raffles was known as a scholar as well as an adventurer</s>
<s>it was as ms glendinning recalls an age when “culture was unitary” with little division between science and the arts and religion</s>
<s>raffles learned local languages and collected artefacts</s>
<s>on the tropical islands he explored he studied animals and birds as well as plants</s>
<s>he even found time to write “the history of java” a book that has had lasting value as source material for historians</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sophia’s firm christian faith sustained her</s>
<s>raffles often felt worn out</s>
<s>he was only 37 when he said in a family letter “as i advance in age retirement becomes more and more congenial to me” yet when he returned to england a few years later he still had the energy to help found the zoological society and to aid william wilberforce’s ambition to build st mary’s mill hill a glorious london church</s>
<s>by honing in on such a great life for her first nonliterary biography ms glendinning is in danger of giving imperialism a good name</s>
