<s>in the days before norodom sihanouk then 18 succeeded to the throne a gust put out the sacred candles lit in the palace to mark the event</s>
<s>courtiers tried to conceal the bad omen but sihanouk heard of it</s>
<s>at his coronation in october 1941 a godking with a crown as tall as a temple people thought he looked uneasy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if so it was not about that</s>
<s>sihanouk—as he always called himself in the third person—was shocked that the french cambodia’s colonial rulers had chosen him as king</s>
<s>he was disturbed too that they expected him to be a figurehead like his father pliant and cuddly a little lamb</s>
<s>true he stayed giggly all his life with a penchant for making films playing saxophone fast cars and pretty women</s>
<s>elvis might have played him he thought</s>
<s>when excited betraying his french education he would cry “ooh la la” in his high child’s voice</s>
<s>but underneath he was a tiger</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“national dignity” was his motto</s>
<s>by that he meant proper independence for “my cambodia”</s>
<s>it began with independence for himself breaking out from the stifling insulating halls of the palace to tour among the peasants</s>
<s>muddy ricefield salutations to “papa king” gave him his taste for active politics</s>
<s>in an indochina roiled by postcolonial disputes and the shoving of the great powers he wanted a dignified neutrality and spent his career struggling to achieve it</s>
<s>on the one hand he tried to stem the revolutionary communism seeping over the border from vietnam on the other he rebuffed attempts by america to make cambodia its puppet</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an accomplished charmer he made friends with anybody who looked useful china’s zhou enlai india’s nehru indonesia’s sukarno north korea’s kim il sung</s>
<s>he made allies even of the khmers rouges who destroyed his country</s>
<s>he also played at his royal whim whichever role seemed most effective king prime minister or humble khmer citizenprince in pyjamas cap and scarf</s>
<s>as a result he survived to croon his love songs into elegant old age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>throwing off his handlers took time and guile</s>
<s>for his first “royal crusade” ejecting the french he travelled secretly to paris in 1953 to petition for independence</s>
<s>rebuffed there he went on to canada the united states and japan genially lifting cambodia out of its obscurity</s>
<s>when the french besieged in the region eventually gave in his old cavalry instructor from saumur remarked “sire you have whipped me” it was a pleasing moment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet he still seemed cast as a figurehead in his newly freed country—a fate tantamount he said to keeping charles de gaulle on the sidelines after the general had freed france</s>
<s>so he moved preemptively renouncing the throne in 1955 to run in cambodia’s first elections</s>
<s>royal powers came in useful to suppress opposition parties especially the newly formed democrats</s>
<s>the peasants rallied round him and he became prime minister</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his country he proclaimed to the world was moderate and modernising new hospitals new schools</s>
<s>it was neither communist nor capitalist but “buddhist socialist” with a feudal flavour</s>
<s>while neighbouring vietnam and laos plunged into civil war cambodia remained his green “oasis of peace” in which visiting dignitaries were regaled with fine french wine and musical numbers by the king himself</s>
<s>he was indifferent to the poverty of the countryside the corruption of his officials and the spread of communist cells his peasants he saw as disobedient children who needed to be put in their place</s>
<s>after one revolt the heads of villagers were displayed in the capital on spikes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile his diplomatic neutrality was cracking too</s>
<s>as vietcong in their thousands sought sanctuary from american firepower in the jungles of eastern cambodia he let them stay—and in 1970 his generals with american backing organised a putsch against him</s>
<s>outraged at this treachery he threw his support behind cambodia’s communists “khmers rouges” in his dismissive phrase giving them legitimacy at a stroke</s>
<s>in 1975 they seized power</s>
<s>sihanouk now immured in his palace under house arrest became a symbol again a useful man to make occasional smiling tours of the collective farms while a quarter of the population perished</s>
<s>five of his own children out of 14 by several women were killed as he waited for the khmers rouges to “spit him out like a cherry pit”</s>
<s>they never did</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>croissants in beijing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when vietnamese forces toppled the khmers rouges in 1979 he fled into exile</s>
<s>his old friends the chinese and north koreans both sheltered him</s>
<s>in pyongyang he had the run of a 60room palace in beijing he feasted with deng xiaoping on croissants fresh from paris</s>
<s>after the vietnamese had left cambodia and the un had brokered peace he returned in 1991 with a squad of north korean bodyguards convinced his rapturous people would want him to rule again</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they did but as the figurehead he had never wanted to be</s>
<s>“papa king” was now checked by a strongman hun sen from the sidelines he chattered on</s>
<s>even after his abdication in 2004 he ran a blog to instruct his people and an online commentary in french on how the country was doing and on his website the blackandwhite slideshow of his reign went on flickering back and forth until the fade</s>
