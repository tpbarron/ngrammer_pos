<s>the battle lines are being drawn in asia over green technologies as governments adapt their tradition of state influence on industry for an era in which ecofriendly products may spell export success</s>
<s>in china japan south korea and elsewhere a big portion of fiscalstimulus measures is dedicated to green projects</s>
<s>it is seen as a way to create new jobs cut carbon emissions at home—and sell products abroad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>globally governments have budgeted as much as $500 billion for “green new deal” projects estimates hsbc a bank</s>
<s>asia accounts for more than threefifths of the total</s>
<s>around 20 of this will have been spent by the end of 2009 with most of the rest to be lavished in 2010</s>
<s>private capital is also pouring in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet where the money is going varies across the region</s>
<s>some countries are emphasising particular sectors like solar power or earlystage technology such as fuel cells with an eye towards building a future market</s>
<s>other initiatives simply apply current technology to reduce domestic emissions carboncapture at power plants for example</s>
<s>only 15 of the spending is aimed at rd notes new energy finance a marketresearch group</s>

<p>
<s>china by some measures has the most ambitious policy</s>
<s>it has dedicated around $220 billion or onethird of its overall fiscal stimulus to projects such as wind solar hydropower and cleancoal technologies</s>
<s>this will help the country achieve its target of increasing the share of renewable energy to 10 by 2010</s>

<p>
<s>in 2010 a generous subsidy will become available for lowemission cars in 13 big cities including beijing shanghai and dalian</s>
<s>china will also subsidise 5070 of the cost of large solarpower projects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the emphasis on solar energy is as much a lifeline for floundering chinese firms as it is an effort to reduce emissions</s>
<s>without subsidies solar is about four times more expensive than energy from the coalpowered grid</s>
<s>but chinese firms have emerged as the biggest solarpanel producers in the world—almost all of it exported—just as the industry faces a massive supply glut that is forcing firms to close</s>
<s>by boosting domestic demand chinas programme has the added goal of absorbing the excess supply and helping the firms to live</s>

<p>
<s>south korea has made green technology a cornerstone of national policy</s>
<s>the budget about $60 billion to be spent by 2012 is smaller than chinas but represents a whopping fourfifths of south koreas total stimulus package</s>
<s>in 2010 tax incentives subsidies credit guarantees and spending programmes will begin to be showered on everything from hybrid cars to fitting buildings with energyefficient led lighting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the country plans to spend around 2 of its gdp on green tech through to 2013 to reduce emissions and spur a new export industry</s>
<s>sandwiched between china with lower costs and japan with superior technology korean manufacturers have much catching up to do in greentech products</s>
<s>bureaucrats hope to increase south koreas global market share in these technologies from 2 to 8 by 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>japan has long been a greentech pioneer</s>
<s>it has set aside $35 billion of its stimulus about 6 for green tech in areas such as subsidies for residential solar projects</s>
<s>its green stimulus is smaller than its neighbours as it already pours in funds from the regular budget $22 billion for the environment and conservation in 2009 of which $7 billion was for clean energy including nuclear power</s>
<s>the new government has set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions</s>
<s>it also promises new spending in 2010 for lowemission cars and energyefficient appliances</s>

<p>
<s>other asian countries have green ambitions</s>
<s>singapore has a war chest of $450m and in 2010 it will build a 55hectare 135acre cleantech office park and fund a solarpower research institute</s>
<s>taiwan plans to spend $1 billion over five years developing solar ledlighting and renewableenergy technologies</s>

<s>what exactly counts as green technology</s>
<s>the figures include water and waste projects that are green but not energyrelated</s>
<s>almost $100 billion of chinas stimulus is for energyefficient rail transport—which may reduce emissions but is ultimately just a train system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>still the focus on green tech is a natural evolution for asias it industries</s>
<s>lcd screens and semiconductor chips share the same materials and manufacturing processes as solar photovoltaic cells many factories have simply been converted from one to the other</s>
<s>the battery technology for electric cars applies the intellectual property that was developed for electronic gadgets</s>

<p>
<s>whether the bureaucrats can channel the public largesse efficiently is an open question</s>
<s>since the immediate purpose is to pumpprime the economy the emphasis will be on dispensing the money rather than on the return on investment</s>
