<s>after the panic the relief</s>
<s>some of the building blocks of the prolonged market rally that began in march 2009 will still be around in 2010</s>
<s>first central banks nervous about raising rates until they are sure the financial system has recovered from the trauma of the credit crunch will keep interest rates low</s>
<s>second the scale of the recession means that it will be some time before inflationary pressures can emerge</s>
<s>and third with interest rates near zero investors are bound to be tempted to move money into risky assets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>corporate profits around the world took a big hit during 2007 and 2008 particularly in the financial sector</s>
<s>there should accordingly be scope for profits to rebound in 2010—by as much as 283 according to forecasts compiled by société générale</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the same time the credit crunch has not disappeared</s>
<s>the number of banks on the federal deposit insurance corporations “at risk” list has been increasing not falling</s>
<s>in many countries commercial property is enduring a rise in vacancies and defaults in a slowmotion replay of the housing crash</s>
<s>privateequity groups still have to roll over debts they incurred in the boom of 2006 and early 2007</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>furthermore investors wellknown tendency to discount the future so helpful to the market in 2009 could be a pain to it in 2010</s>
<s>central banks have introduced an extraordinary flurry of measures to deal with the credit crunch including guarantees of bank debt and the outright purchase of assets</s>
<s>at some point they will have to unwind those strategies</s>
<s>even if that unwinding is delayed until 2011 investors may spend the second half of 2010 speculating about it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>government bond markets could provide the trickiest test</s>
<s>budget deficits have soared during the crisis and are expected to hit more than 10 of gdp in both britain and america</s>
<s>but bond yields have not soared</s>
<s>in part this was because inflation stayed low and investors were riskaverse in the alarm of the recession</s>
<s>but central banks also helped by buying bonds</s>
<s>if the recovery reaches full speed central banks will stop purchasing bonds and may want to sell those they already own</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if bond yields are not to soar as a result governments will need plausible plans to cut their deficits in the medium term</s>
<s>but those plans may be difficult to produce given that there will be a general election in britain and midterm elections in america</s>
<s>and there is also a double risk</s>
<s>a move to curb deficits by raising taxes or cutting spending could stifle the recovery as the japanese did by raising the consumption tax in 1997</s>
<s>but if governments do not act then markets may tighten policy for them by pushing yields up sharply</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>currency markets may also be affected</s>
<s>developed countries are hardly likely to default on their bonds</s>
<s>but creditors are still at risk if they are repaid in a devalued currency</s>
<s>countries that appear to have lost control of their finances could see their exchange rates suffer</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed although government action has stabilised the global economy a whole raft of questions remains unanswered</s>
<s>has the long period of credit expansion—dubbed the “debt supercycle” by martin barnes of bank credit analyst—come to an end</s>
<s>if so will the result be a long period of sluggish growth</s>
<s>can china and india carry the global economy on their own</s>
<s>will another surge in oil prices dampen recovery as it has so many times before</s>
<s>will a more regulated economy particularly in the financial sector mean that profits form a lower proportion of gdp</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it may well be that mediumterm economic growth will be slower as a result of the crisis</s>
<s>some capacity has been destroyed and in developed countries the babyboomers are now starting to retire which will limit the potential size of the labour force</s>
<s>japan has spent two uncomfortable decades adjusting to an era of slower growth and greying population</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all these issues can be summed up in one big dilemma</s>
<s>if the economy does not enjoy a typically vigorous rebound then the equity market must come under threat</s>
<s>and if the economy does manage that upturn then surely government bond prices will fall sharply</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this points to a potentially turbulent year</s>
<s>in the past huge market setbacks have been followed not by periods of calm but by long stretches of volatility</s>
<s>the great depression included some of the best years ever for wall street with shares rising by over 50 in 1933 and nearly 40 in 1935</s>
<s>but even though shares reached their bottom in 1932 investors still had to live through a flat year in 1934 and a 38 decline in share prices in 1937</s>
<s>in britain the bumper year of 1975 when equities more than doubled was followed by a fall in 1976</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when a stone falls into a pond the ripples persist for a while</s>
<s>the credit crunch was a whopping great boulder</s>
