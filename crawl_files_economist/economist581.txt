<s>“the only function of economic forecasting” said jk galbraith a harvard economist “is to make astrology look respectable” how did our stars align in the world in 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in some respects surprisingly well</s>
<s>we imagined what would happen if after years of fuelling the world economy with their spending americans suddenly started saving 5 of what they earn</s>
<s>they did and the result was as predicted recession</s>
<s>the richworld recession proved even deeper than we expected but we rightly believed that actions by governments and central banks would avoid a 1930sstyle depression</s>
<s>we gave warning that britain would lose control over its public finances its budget deficit has soared and quickly see unemployment surge to 8 by july it was 79</s>

<s>growth in emerging markets we thought would remain relatively robust in many countries</s>
<s>so it has turned out</s>
<s>in the dark days of the slump many people would have been amazed if chinas growth in 2009 proved to be as vigorous as the 8 we forecast</s>
<s>yet it has</s>

<p>
<s>no great skill was required to point to a coming surge in bankruptcies or a shakeup in finance</s>
<s>better we identified goldman sachs jpmorgan chase and banco santander as three banks likely to emerge as winners from the crisis</s>
<s>and amid the market gloom a year ago we suggested that bulls might be ready to charge again in 2009</s>

<s>in politics too several of our main prognostications came true barack obamas difficulties in living up to unrealistic expectations of him the wests deepening troubles in afghanistan big emerging economies seeking a greater say in running the world</s>
<s>we gave notice that talk of abolishing nuclear weapons would grow louder in prague in april mr obama duly ratcheted up the rhetoric with his call for a nuclearfree world</s>

<p>
<s>perhaps the most precise prediction was on british politics</s>
<s>we pinpointed june 5th —just after the elections for the european parliament—as the day of greatest peril for gordon brown</s>
<s>the knives were indeed out for the prime minister at that time</s>
<s>but as we thought he would he survived lame but unmovable</s>

<s>however where would be the fun in forecasting or the wit in galbraiths jibe if there werent plenty of misses as well as hits</s>

<s>we were confident that the 2016 olympics would be awarded to chicago rio de janeiro triumphantly proved otherwise</s>
<s>we underestimated the strength of the congress partys election victory in india and of the opposition dpjs triumph in japan</s>
<s>our report on the death of the european unions lisbon treaty proved to be greatly exaggerated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>just as important as the sins of commission are those of omission</s>
<s>readers of the world in 2009 had to work hard to find a reference to the increasingly important g20 group of leading economies though thanks to kevin rudd australias prime minister it wasnt completely ignored</s>
<s>they would have found no mention of a scandal over politicians expenses in britain or a bailout of american carmakers</s>
<s>we failed to flag the postelection unrest in iran or the ethnic unrest in chinas xinjiang province</s>
<s>the biggest news story of the year was missing entirely the death of michael jackson</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this should help readers interpret the predictions they find in the current issue</s>
<s>we hope many of these will prove right</s>
<s>no doubt quite a few will turn out to be wrong</s>
<s>and inevitably some of the most important events of the year ahead will be missing altogether</s>
<s>for those really unpredictable things—what donald rumsfeld has called the “unknown unknowns”—you might as well look to the zodiac</s>
