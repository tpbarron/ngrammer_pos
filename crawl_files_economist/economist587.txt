<s>“bronze” is less an art exhibition than an aesthete’s wishlist of treasures</s>
<s>it has no theme the curators advance no theory nor do they make or refute any historic arguments</s>

<s>but “bronze” is a parade of masterpieces a popup museum of some of the finest bronzes in the world</s>
<s>it is thrilling overwhelming and ultimately exhausting</s>
<s>but it is fatigue in a good cause</s>
