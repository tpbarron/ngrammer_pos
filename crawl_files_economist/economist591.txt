<s>in the next decade nearly 1 billion women are likely to enter the global labour force</s>
<s>but their economic potential is largely unrealised</s>
<s>according to a report by booz  company a consultancy if female employment rates matched those of men gdp would increase by 5 in america and 9 in japan by 2020</s>
<s>the impact would be even larger for developing countries home to most of the world’s women who lack adequate education and support social and political</s>
<s>increasing female employment would increase gdp significantly in countries like india and egypt where female labourparticipation rates are below 30</s>
<s>these countries rank low in booz’s index of women’s economic empowerment</s>
