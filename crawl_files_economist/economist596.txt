<s>on november 6th sri lanka’s parliament tabled the impeachment of the chief justice</s>
<s>the speaker who happens to be the president’s eldest brother now appoints a committee of mps to investigate the allegations against shirani bandaranayake</s>
<s>among the 14 charges is that she failed to declare money in 20odd bank accounts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the state media call the charges damning</s>
<s>yet it is curious that the government and not the police is investigating the chief justice</s>
<s>america’s state department worries aloud about the independence of sri lanka’s judiciary</s>
<s>a veteran newspaper editor says that the showdown between the government and the supreme court is unlikely to produce any victors “the first casualty will be the country’s stability”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the president had hinted for some time that the chief justice had got too big for her boots</s>
<s>in september the judicial services commission jsc which she chairs turned down a summons to meet mr mahinda rajapaksa</s>
<s>when the president’s secretary telephoned the commission he was told to send a written invitation giving reasons for the discussion</s>
<s>then manjula tilakaratne the jsc secretary issued a press statement alleging unspecified efforts afoot to destroy the judiciary’s independence—the aspersions were clear enough</s>
<s>in october four unidentified men assaulted mr tilakaratne in colombo the capital</s>
<s>the attack was roundly condemned</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some personal disagreement seems to lie between mrs bandaranayake and the president</s>
<s>once they had got along just fine</s>
<s>mr rajapaksa appointed her as chief justice a year after he made her husband pradeed kariyawasam chairman of the national savings bank nsb</s>
<s>mr kariyawasam resigned in may over a questionable share transaction</s>
<s>the bribery commission appointed by the president fasttracked the investigation</s>
<s>on october 25th the commission filed an action in court accusing mr kariyawasam of having caused the government tens of thousands of dollars in losses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>curiously the impeachment comes just as the supreme court ruled on a sweeping and controversial povertyalleviation bill</s>
<s>the ruling handed down by a bench headed by mrs bandaranayake held that parts of the government’s draft legislation were inconsistent with the constitution</s>
<s>it said that one clause unless amended required the approval of a national referendum</s>
<s>it was the second time the supreme court had blocked the bill</s>
<s>in september the court ruled that the country’s nine provincial councils needed to approve the bill before its enactment</s>
<s>mr rajapaksa was said to have been furious at such impudence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the bill known as the divineguma act has some alarming features</s>
<s>it vests the minister for economic development—who in this case is the president’s youngest brother basil—with sweeping powers</s>
<s>he would choose how monies in a big divineguma development fund are used with no parliamentary or public oversight</s>
<s>he would also control new banks and banking societies set up under the bill</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is far from evident that this is the right approach to poverty alleviation</s>
<s>rather such measures would grant basil rajapaksa much political influence over the country’s rural population</s>
<s>among other things implementation would draw back to the centre powers devolved to the provinces 25 years ago in an effort to solve ethnic conflict</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now that the supreme court has upheld the main arguments against the bill the ruling party’s general secretary says it will amend the bill to avert the referendum the court called for</s>
<s>but he did not lay out what the proposed changes would be</s>
<s>few are persuaded that it represents an aboutface</s>
<s>the government’s priority has always been the centralisation of power</s>
<s>that is hardly likely to change—especially with the chief justice now in the dock</s>
