<s>jackie baptiste’s working day begins at seven o’clock when she goes to a council house drags someone else’s children out of bed and packs them off to school</s>
<s>the social worker is not a woman to be trifled with</s>
<s>“they might tell me to foff but it’s only words” she shrugs</s>
<s>sometimes she films the desperate attempts of a mother to control her brood then plays the recording back offering tips on how to do it right</s>
<s>she attends parentteacher meetings appointments with doctors and counselling for alcoholism and domestic violence all the while holding the hands of her adult charges</s>
<s>in a typical week she will see the same family five or six times as part of westminster council’s family recovery programme</s>
<s>she is part of a growing movement and the product of a remarkable political consensus</s>

<s>the state has long meddled with poor families</s>
<s>in his autobiography charlie chaplin recalls that on entering a london workhouse he and his brother sydney were sent off to the children’s wing while his mother went to the women’s wing a separation that had been routine since the poor law of 1834</s>
<s>there were still several thousand children living in such places when the last ones were abolished in the 1940s and britain began building a comprehensive welfare state</s>
<s>in the decades since the government has acquired many more children though it houses them differently</s>
<s>there are currently 66000 children in care meaning they have been removed voluntarily or otherwise from their biological parents</s>
<s>the majority are shuffled between shortterm placements with foster families</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is where the new scheme comes in</s>
<s>for although taking children from their parents may sometimes be the least bad thing to do the government is in aggregate a deadbeat feckless parent</s>
<s>children who have been in care are 50 times more likely to go to prison than those who have not according to calculations by policy exchange a thinktank</s>
<s>they are also 66 times more likely to see their own children taken into care</s>
<s>this is not for lack of money the average bill for taking a child under the state’s wing is £38000 $61400 per year</s>
<s>better then to employ a latterday mary poppins to nanny a family into staying together</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>parents who are at risk of losing their children their liberty and their housing can choose to enroll in westminster’s programme</s>
<s>most of those eligible have decided to do so</s>
<s>“we say ‘those people over there want to take your house and your child away</s>
<s>we want to work with you to make sure that does not happen’” explains natasha bishopp who is in charge of the scheme</s>
<s>each family signs a contract</s>
<s>if its terms are broken the council does what it would have done anyway</s>
<s>so far that has happened to just 15 of the 210 contracts signed since 2008</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>part of the reason for this success ms bishopp argues is that people who are constantly pestered by the government’s agencies tend to experience its sanctions either as empty threats or as sudden and mystifying</s>
<s>the contract helps overcome that as does embodying the state in the form of a single smiling individual</s>
<s>gail porter who runs similar schemes for lancashire council reports one of the families her team works with had previously received visits from 21 separate agencies</s>
<s>the results of these programmes and others like them have encouraged the government to launch a national troubled families programme</s>
<s>central government will provide £4000 per family and local authorities a further £6000 in the hope of improving the lives of 120000 families between now and 2015</s>

<s>this points to an interesting convergence in british politics</s>
<s>for all that labour likes to paint the tories as a heartless bunch intent on slashing welfare and the conservatives retort that labour would trap the poor on state benefits for ever—lines of argument that were on display throughout this year’s party conferences—the two parties have come to startlingly similar conclusions on how to help the poorest and most dysfunctional families</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the culture pause</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>british policy wonks go through cycles of treating poor people as an income problem and as a culture problem</s>
<s>at the moment they are in a culture phase</s>
<s>this is mainly because the income thesis which had the upper hand for most of the past few decades was tested and found inadequate under the previous government</s>
<s>a huge expansion of tax credits did not do much for what charles booth called the “submerged tenth” of society</s>
<s>besides under the relativeincome measure of child poverty that the previous government judged itself on the number of poor children in britain has gone down since the financial crisis which cut median incomes</s>
<s>arrange for a lehman brothers to fail every year and the problem would be solved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the end of its tenure labour had decided that culture mattered more</s>
<s>the results of sure start a network of optional parenting classes created under labour were and still are disappointing</s>
<s>tony blair’s government began to experiment with familyintervention projects</s>
<s>gordon brown was keen on them too visiting one in dundee before he became prime minister</s>
<s>louise casey a civil servant who ran this effort for mr blair is in charge of the present scheme</s>
<s>labour seems reluctant to attack an approach it pushed when in government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for conservatives the promise of keeping families together trumps traditional concerns about an interfering state</s>
<s>tories also like the programme’s focus on teaching people how to take responsibility for their own lives and its promise of saving money in the long term</s>
<s>the party that rails against the nanny state has come to embrace state nannying</s>
<s>ms baptiste thus enjoys crossparty support for her afternoon task taking a pair of marigold gloves from her bottomless bag and helping one of her families to tidy up its messy flat</s>
