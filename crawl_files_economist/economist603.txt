<s>“what does not kill me will make me stronger” that should be the motto of the alternativeenergy industry in 2010</s>
<s>the past year has been a rough one</s>
<s>people are less disposed to make costly gestures towards environmental protection in a slump</s>
<s>but for the bold there is opportunity</s>
<s>in particular solarenergy researchers will chase the hithertomythical beast called “cheaper than coal” which will enable them to compete in the electricitygeneration market without subsidies while battery engineers will chase that equally elusive creature the vehicle cellpack which can be recharged as rapidly as a petrol tank</s>

<s>they will be assisted in their quests by the activities of steven chu barack obamas energy secretary</s>
<s>dr chu a physicist with a lot of experience in energy research has been sowing the ground with money in 2009 and in 2010 will expect to start reaping</s>
<s>a world that has lived for more than two centuries on cheap fossil fuels has seen little need to spend heavily on basic research into alternatives but that means a lot of potentially fruitful lines of investigation remain unpursued</s>
<s>now the antirecession fiscal stimulus should uncover via dr chus largesse to the laboratories of americas universities a host of ideas that venture capitalists may turn their attention to when the economy rebounds</s>

<s>even commercially though the news is not all bad</s>
<s>china for example is often portrayed in western media as the uncaring überpolluter of the future because of its massive coalfired powerstation programme</s>
<s>but it also has one of the worlds biggest windpower programmes</s>
<s>by the end of 2010 the countrys windgenerating capacity will be about 20 gigawatts—equal to spains and only slightly behind germanys and americas</s>
<s>the aim is to have 100 gigawatts by 2020</s>
<s>that is an eighth of chinas present electricitygenerating capacity</s>
<s>it must of course be remembered that wind turbines do not turn all the time</s>
<s>nevertheless a study published in science reckons that at current prices which are guaranteed into the future by the government when a wind farm is built wind could replace a quarter of chinas coalfired power stations</s>

<s>the coming year will also see the opening shots in an intergreen war</s>
<s>this will be caused by the introduction of the first massmarket or so their manufacturers hope electric saloon cars in america and japan</s>
<s>chinas attempt to be first in the form of byd autos f3dm has not gone well</s>
<s>sales are pitiful</s>
<s>but the chevrolet volt and nissans leaf are built to much higher standards by wellestablished companies</s>
<s>none of these cars relies solely on its batteries for power</s>
<s>all have petroldriven generators to keep the wheels turning if the batteries run flat</s>
<s>but unlike existing hybrids such as the toyota prius in which the petrol engine drives the car directly these socalled plugin hybrids are pureelectric vehicles when it comes to turning the wheels</s>

<s>the war will be between supporters of electric vehicles and those of biofuels for these too will begin to leap forward</s>
<s>at the moment “biofuel” means either ethanol made by the fermentation of sugars from cane or maize or biodiesel from processed plant oils</s>
<s>in 2010 “advanced” ethanol—made from straw wood chippings and suchlike using new technological tricks such as genetically engineered bacteria to do the fermenting—will start coming out of pilot plants</s>
<s>so too will “designer” biodiesel made from sugar but turned into hydrocarbons that should be even better than fuels from oil</s>

<s>greens who accept the need for personal motorised transport at all may thus have difficulty choosing</s>
<s>electric cars themselves are zeroemission but their overall environmental credentials depend on how the electricity is generated in the first place</s>
<s>if it comes from coal they are still better in globalwarming terms than traditional cars—but not by as much as they could be if the power were wind solar or even whisper it not nuclear</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>biofuels meanwhile will remain controversial</s>
<s>their carbon comes via photosynthesis from the atmosphere so they do not contribute directly to global warming when they are burned</s>
<s>but their indirect environmental “bads”—competition with food crops the need to clear virgin land to grow them and the energy costs of processing them—all cause anguish</s>
<s>tricky</s>
