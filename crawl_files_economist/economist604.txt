<s>it is tempting to think of the process of evolution as one of continuous stately progress towards betterdesigned organisms</s>
<s>in fact it is full of blind alleys—as a fossil called microraptor shows</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at some point during the jurassic period a group of dinosaurs evolved feathers</s>
<s>these may have been for warmth for display or for both</s>
<s>they were certainly not at the beginning for flight</s>
<s>but in one line of these dinosaurs evolution modified them for precisely that purpose</s>
<s>this modification led via archaeopteryx a species that lived 150m years ago to birds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>feathered dinosaurs did not go away just because they had spun off the birds though</s>
<s>they persisted right up until the end of the cretaceous period 65m years ago when all nonavian dinosaurs met their ends</s>
<s>and well before that in a part of the cretaceous called the aptian 120m years ago the whole thing happened again in the form of microraptor</s>
<s>except that this time the flying animal in question had four wings rather than two</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microraptor’s existence raises two questions exactly how did it deploy its four wings and why does it have no living descendants</s>
<s>the answers according to michael habib and justin hall of the university of southern california are linked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>until recently there were two schools of thought about how microraptor carried its wings when in flight</s>
<s>one school proposed that it looked like a biplane holding one set of wings above the other when it flew</s>
<s>the second school suggested that all four wings were coplanar</s>
<s>dr habib and mr hall however think both are wrong</s>
<s>they see a division of labour between the two sets of wings</s>
<s>the front pair they agree provided lift</s>
<s>but they believe that the back pair were for steering</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microraptor’s hindwings were radically different in shape from its forewings</s>
<s>rather than being lithe and graceful they were short and stubby</s>
<s>but they would have made good rudders as dr habib and mr hall have demonstrated using a computer model of them</s>
<s>this suggests they would have allowed the animal to reduce the radius of its turning circle by 40 and almost triple the speed of a turn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that makes sense</s>
<s>the rocks microraptor fossils are found in are also full of trees</s>
<s>clearly it was a forest animal</s>
<s>predatory birds that dwell in modern forests such as the sharpshinned hawk are masters of making tight quick turns around trunks and over branches as they pursue their prey</s>
<s>that microraptor was a predator is known because one specimen has a bird in its belly</s>
<s>it would surely have benefited from a similar capability</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>why then was such an aerial paragon not ancestral to any modern creature</s>
<s>one possibility is bad luck</s>
<s>the mass extinction at the end of the cretaceous was caused by a collision between earth and an asteroid or comet</s>
<s>though some groups of animals did better than others survival was often at random</s>
<s>however the fossil record does not prove that any microraptor–like animal actually made it to the end of the cretaceous</s>
<s>they probably become extinct well before that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr habib proposes that what actually did for microraptor was what he calls a drag tax</s>
<s>his model suggests the manoeuvrability that its hind wings granted the animal came at the expense of increased drag</s>
<s>modern birds do not pay the drag tax because their manoeuvrability results from a single pair of wings that are better able to cope with stress than microraptor’s forewings were</s>
<s>that stressresistance is provided by muscles which are attached to a keellike extension of the sternum</s>
<s>microraptor lacked this keel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>according to dr habib birds adapted for forest flight are able to make the same turns that microraptor made but without losing nearly as much energy to drag</s>
<s>this he argues made bird flight more efficient—and that would have made it impossible for microraptor to compete</s>
