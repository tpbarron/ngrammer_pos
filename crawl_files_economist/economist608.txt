<s>tarzan a wild child raised in the jungle came back to polite society and hurled around uncouth ideas</s>
<s>it is fitting then that lord heseltine the blondmopped former conservative cabinet minister who on october 31st published a report demanding a new industrial policy bears the nickname</s>
<s>his recipe for restoring growth links together localism economic interventionism and radical whitehall reform</s>
<s>call it tarzanomics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 79yearold peer a boris johnson of his day in flamboyance and verbal flair has been touring the regions and is determined to smash london’s dominance of britain’s industrial landscape</s>
<s>westminster is thus reverberating to echoes of the 1980s when as a cabinet big beast michael heseltine as he then was challenged margaret thatcher’s approach to reforming the economy</s>
<s>although he lost that battle he caused much political drama in the process—and came to embody a divide between taxcutting centrists and regional devolvers which persists to this day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>david cameron commissioned lord heseltine’s review</s>
<s>it was a bold—some might say risky—appointment by the prime minister</s>
<s>last year the tory tarzan had bashed the government for replacing labour’s regional development agencies which doled out cash to businesses with weaker local enterprise partnerships leps offering merely advice</s>
<s>his central role in mrs thatcher’s downfall and his proeuropean interventionist outlook put him at odds with many tory backbenchers</s>
<s>given his history of making mischief it isn’t so surprising that many enthusiastic heseltinians are in the labour party</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the bullish businessman lord heseltine is also a successful publisher who has devoted much of his career to boosting britain’s struggling industrial cities has pinpointed a problem with the country’s uneven economic development</s>
<s>london and the south east have had lots of privatesector growth while the formerly industrial regions in the north and midlands haven’t</s>
<s>between 1990 and 2010 gross value added—a measure of income—grew by 127 in the northern and midlands regions see chart</s>
<s>in the south east and london it grew by 197</s>
<s>several cities such as birmingham and nottingham actually lost privatesector jobs in the decade before the 2008 recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his report draws attention to one of the main reasons for this</s>
<s>power he claims has become too centralised in whitehall which is inefficient and bureaucratic</s>
<s>although the coalition trumpets its devolution agenda and in particular the “city deals” intended to give more power and cash to local authorities its localism measures are tepid</s>
<s>one flagship policy to introduce elected mayors in several larger cities was mostly trounced in referendums in may</s>
<s>sway over local economies such as the west midlands conurbation is split between too many local authorities none of which is strong enough to push through big reforms or infrastructure projects</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some of lord heseltine’s suggestions here are helpful</s>
<s>the new leps are unpopular with many businesses and many do not work well with local authorities</s>
<s>boosting their resources with cash seized from whitehall might make the new city regions work more efficiently</s>
<s>making it easier for small councils to merge into bigger unitary authorities would aid that too</s>
<s>his asides on the negative effects of immigration policy he wants mr cameron to allow in more skilled workers and the impact of unsatisfactory airport capacity in london are invigorating</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but of the 89 recommendations in the report many others fail to convince</s>
<s>politicians hardly need to be told that schools need to improve or that planning should be “strategic”</s>
<s>lord heseltine also sets too much store by business associations which are often too keen to defend the stagnant firms he is worried about</s>
<s>and suggestions that the government should be more sceptical towards foreign takeovers risk conflating nonbritish ownership with predatory shorttermist behaviour</s>
<s>the encouraging comeback of the british car industry under japanese german and indian management shows that this is unfair</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover the report’s central premise—that local and central government bodies need to intervene to support business—is dated</s>
<s>successive postwar administrations dazzled by the resurgence of germany’s postwar “socialmarket economy” dabbled with corporatist support for key industries and even companies see article</s>
<s>but dirigisme created a mess in the 1970s prime ministers from margaret thatcher onwards preferred to let the market do its thing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it’s a jungle out there tarzan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the interventionist idea has experienced two modest revivals one under lord heseltine as president of the board of trade in the 1990s and another under lord mandelson labour’s business secretary in 200810 buffeted by the economic crisis his party reassessed its handsoff economic credo</s>
<s>but the coalition government swiftly ended much of this in 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>back in march when lord heseltine was called upon the country was in recession and the coalition was prepared to seek salvation from any quarter</s>
<s>now the tory leadership feels more constrained by thatcherite rebels</s>
<s>some of his decentralising proposals might yet receive a positive reception says an ally of mr cameron</s>
<s>but more drastic industrial measures which may appeal to liberal democrats will meet with “deep scepticism” from the chancellor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>complicating matters further are the internal politics of the department for business innovation and skills</s>
<s>here lord heseltine has an additional role focused on regional growth</s>
<s>his colleagues at the department today are a microcosm of the wider coalition ranging from a sympathetic liberal democrat business secretary vince cable via a receptive universities minister david willetts a conservative to a thatcherite minister for business and enterprise michael fallon</s>
<s>these divisions suit the chancellor who will probably reject much of the report just fine</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the most likely outcome is that lord heseltine will have only patchy influence on real decisions</s>
<s>as he notes britain now faces the competition of “emerging economies that want our jobs and our wealth”</s>
<s>alas tarzanomics doesn’t look like a solution to this headache—at least not one that can thrive in the coalition jungle</s>
