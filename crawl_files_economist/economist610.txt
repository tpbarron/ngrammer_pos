<p>
<s>an unexpected end fits neatly with the oddness of mr pandit’s citi career</s>

<s>citi’s recovery is far from complete and the bank’s longterm earnings power is unclear</s>
<s>mike mayo an analyst at clsa a broker faults him for misjudging the severity of citi’s problems and not pruning the scope of its businesses sufficiently hard</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr pandit did not manage to rid citi of its historic propensity to slip up either</s>
<s>a request in march to provide a multibilliondollar dividend payment to shareholders was embarrassingly rejected by citi’s regulators as imprudent</s>

<s>he needs to appoint an executive team</s>
<s>he needs to make difficult decisions about asset sales while preserving the institution’s morale</s>

<s>mr o’neill who was an industry star in the 1990s at bank of america and barclays before stepping away because of health problems was unable to offer a clear explanation for mr pandit’s exit</s>
<s>if mr corbat staggers the question will not be about how to end the new chief executive’s tenure but rather after so many surprises and suspect decisions that of the board</s>
