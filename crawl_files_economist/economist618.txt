<s>since april 2009 journalists have been writing of green shoots economists have been reporting rising output and investors have gleefully pocketed big gains on their equity portfolios</s>
<s>but for many households the good news seemed to pass them by</s>
<s>millions of jobs disappeared homeloan defaults mounted and corporate restructuring made the workplace distinctly unsettling</s>
<s>will the recovery that started in the final months of 2009 bring wider relief in the year ahead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>perhaps not</s>
<s>much of the lift in 2009 came from two sources</s>
<s>first factories that shut down when global demand slumped reopened to restock nearlyempty shelves</s>
<s>second massive publicspending programmes began to feed through taxes were cut and central banks slashed interest rates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but what happens in 2010 when the warehouses are full again</s>
<s>production could grind to a halt unless sales of fridges cars and clothing pick up</s>
<s>there is little chance of that happening until battered consumers shed debt and recover their nerve and that seems unlikely as long as unemployment remains high</s>
<s>governments meanwhile cant fund the recovery for ever</s>
<s>most central banks have cut interest rates as much as they can and flooded the financial system with cash</s>
<s>public spending can stay high but further increases would be unaffordable in most countries</s>
<s>so 2010 could be a disappointment</s>
<s>the recovery will be a longer slog than many expect</s>

<p>
<s>as usual the story is brighter in the emerging world although even here there are nuances</s>
<s>china remains the place to watch</s>
<s>the collapsing american and european economies flattened chinas exports but the government produced the mother of all stimulus packages</s>
<s>that combined with a lending boom when chinas bankers are told to lend they lend was enough to keep the economy purring along at 8 slower than before yes but still impressive</s>
<s>unlike most other countries china can afford to do it again in 2010 if necessary</s>
<s>to be sure a statedirected spending boom does not inspire deep confidence and chinas economy remains unbalanced—too much saving too little consumption</s>
<s>but those longterm problems will not prevent another year of 8plus growth in 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plenty of other economies will benefit from chinas success</s>
<s>its statebacked infrastructure projects are boosting demand for the exports of other asian countries and commodity producers from australia to brazil will be dragged along by the dragons tail</s>
<s>india should also pick up assuming a better harvest than in 2009</s>
<s>eastern europe is a real worry burdened with too much debt and with too few solvent customers in their west european export markets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two things will become clearer in 2010</s>
<s>first in the rich world hopes of a vshaped recovery will be laid to rest the excesses of the past seven years will take more than a few good months to fix</s>
<s>second in the developing world government spending will keep the factories churning while policymakers try to rebalance their economies for longterm growth</s>
<s>in china that means more pressure for reforms that will help persuade consumers to start spending their hardearned savings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>policymakers in the west will mostly have to content themselves with not making the situation worse</s>
<s>take trade the global economy would benefit from a tradeliberalising doha deal but as unemployment rises governments will have their work cut out just to keep protectionism at bay</s>
<s>similarly with public spending much as governments might love to pump more cash into their fragile economies ballooning national debts will make that hard</s>
<s>and central bankers will struggle to do more than raise interest rates modestly as worries about recovery trump fears of inflation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so after hectic crisismanagement 2010 will be a quieter time for policy</s>
<s>with luck that will allow governments to focus on their next big task—drawing up credible plans for bringing their bloated budget deficits under control</s>
