<s>between his first inauguration and the presidential election of 2004 george w bush paid no fewer than 44 visits to pennsylvania a battleground state that he was determined to deny to his democratic opponent john kerry</s>
<s>so fierce was his ardour that late in the campaign he found time to fly to rural lancaster county there to meet and woo the strawhatted horseandbuggydriving amish</s>
<s>in vain mr kerry won pennsylvania albeit by only 144000 votes out of almost 58m cast</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the last republican presidential candidate to win pennsylvania was the elder george bush in 1988</s>
<s>yet the state with its 20 electoral college votes is more finely balanced than that record would suggest</s>
<s>reasons include population shifts out of the big cities a hardening of conservative views among workingclass “reagan democrats” in the state’s southwest and a history of ticketsplitting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>barack obama won pennsylvania by some 620000 votes four years ago and is five points ahead in opinion polls there this time</s>
<s>but he won almost 600000 of his votes in philadelphia the rambunctious mostly nonwhite overwhelmingly democratic city that dominates the state’s southeast</s>
<s>narrower victories in the philadelphia suburbs as well as in the western city of pittsburgh and a small handful of bluecollar unionheavy counties then carried him across the line</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to win mr obama will need another whopping turnout among core supporters to counter republican strength in the “t” a treeshaped zone with a trunk and canopy of white rural districts whose fierce views on guns god and government are reminiscent of regions farther south earning it the nickname “pennsyltucky”</s>
<s>in the state’s southwestern corner the picture is completed by bluecollar increasingly conservative communities built on such gritty industries as coal and steel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet mitt romney has given the state only fitful attention</s>
<s>in part says a local republican bigwig the romney campaign has suffered from tactical blunders as when it failed to spot that the obama camp was snapping up cheap cable tv spots to attack mr romney in the state’s west</s>
<s>it does not help that the republican governor tom corbett has poor approval ratings so that in the gleeful words of mary isenhour a democratic strategist he “couldn’t deliver a newspaper in this state for mitt romney” let alone hauls of votes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>most notably state republicans expended political capital on a contentious voteridentity law obliging voters to show official uptodate photo id cards to cast ballots</s>
<s>the law was attacked by democrats as a ploy to disenfranchise poor urban or elderly obama voters who lack driving licences and who found it hard to get alternative identity papers</s>
<s>republicans said they were fighting voter fraud</s>
<s>however nonpartisan groups such as the committee of seventy a venerable cleangovernment watchdog in philadelphia declared that voter impersonation was not a serious problem though the committee notes the existence of other shenanigans including the payment of “street money” to local activists at election time ostensibly to cover expenses</s>
<s>the law’s republican sponsor in the state legislature unhelpfully said it was not the authorities’ fault if voters were too “lazy” to obtain the right papers</s>
<s>then on october 2nd a state judge put enforcement of the law on hold until after the elections leaving republicans with the worst of all outcomes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet pennsylvania democrats have no room for complacency</s>
<s>a senate race—pitting a oneterm incumbent bob casey against tom smith a teapartybacked coal magnate—has tightened in recent weeks</s>
<s>though mr casey is the son of a popular former governor mr smith has vowed to spend millions of dollars of his own fortune on the campaign lashing mr casey as a donothing proxy for mr obama</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the republicans are hoping to hold congressional seats too thanks not least to a shameless redrawing of house of representative districts by the republicancontrolled state legislature creating bizarre amoebalike districts that twist and turn through multiple counties to take in pockets of republican voters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for what it is worth the amish though a theologically unbending bunch have no objection to mr romney’s religion</s>
<s>mormons do not have the same biblical principles as other christians says an amish carpenter at his family workshop in lancaster county</s>
<s>but the amish know mormons as “fair and square businessmen” and have no problem with them “they’re solid conservatives” the carpenter predicts however that fewer than 1000 of the state’s 60000 amish will vote at all</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>final election results—both for the white house and the senate—will probably turn on vital “collar” counties around philadelphia</s>
<s>these suburbs have drifted from solidly republican to undecided in recent years</s>
<s>in part that is thanks to liberals fleeing the big city in search of better schools and greenery</s>
<s>in part there is a growing gulf between a rockribbed state republican party and middleclass suburban republicans who may be fiscally conservative but are socially moderate</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ironically says zack stalberg a longtime philadelphia newspaper editor who now runs the committee of seventy if republicans had expended the same energy selling their presidential candidate in the suburbs as they devoted to their doomed voterid law it would have done their cause “a lot more good”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not even democrats think mr obama is invulnerable in those suburbs</s>
<s>yet if mr romney hopes to catch up he does not have much time</s>
