<s>the 2009 mps’ expenses scandal cast a long shadow over british politics</s>
<s>it also led to the creation of an independent parliamentary standards authority ipsa tasked with cleaning up the system</s>

<s>despite their public reputation for caligulan excess westminster legislators are rather modestly remunerated by international standards</s>
<s>and for the past century their pay has stagnated relative to that of their constituents</s>
<s>ipsa suggests indexing it to national average earnings at a ratio of between 15 and 4</s>
<s>currently the ratio hovers between 25 and 29 so—controversially—a rise could be on the cards</s>
<s>mps may need the cash</s>
<s>it has been made harder to file creative expenses claims</s>
<s>and politicians will probably be asked to contribute more to their extremely generous pension schemes in future</s>
