<s>at a time when financial firms will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to settle legal claims as a matter of expedience deutsche bank has done the unthinkable</s>
<s>in response to an order in september from the enforcement division of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc demanding $16m in fines and disgorgement for alleged powermarket manipulation the bank has drawn a line in the sand</s>
<s>on november 5th it submitted an 83page response and vowed to fight the charges even though it says the cost of the legal defence will probably exceed the cost of the proposed penalty</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>deutsche’s intransigence is set to be copied by barclays</s>
<s>on october 31st ferc filed an “order to show cause” demanding that the british bank pay a fine of $470m for its own alleged efforts to manipulate energy markets it also levied $18m in fines on four of its traders</s>
<s>barclays promised to fight the charges and issue its own deutschelike response within 30 days</s>
<s>another case is said to be in the works against jpmorgan chase and resistance would not be surprising in that one as well</s>
<s>in march ferc achieved its biggest success settling a case against constellation energy a baltimorebased utility for $245m</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the charges against constellation barclays and deutsche all centre on “relatedposition” cases meaning that the companies traded in the actual deliverable market for electricity while simultaneously trading in financial markets tied to electricity</s>
<s>they are accused of distorting prices in one market—even at a loss—to benefit positions in the other</s>
<s>the firms all hotly deny these claims</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed deutsche believes that the ability of firms to trade simultaneously in related markets is under threat from ferc’s actions</s>
<s>“one might wonder why dbet deutsche bank energy trading has not already settled” the bank asked rhetorically in its filing</s>
<s>“the answer comes down to principle” undermining such trading says deutsche is a “radical” proposition that is not only wrong but counterproductive</s>
<s>it would “fracture the foundation of organised power markets”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all the cases involve events that have occurred in the past few years but the core issues go back to the 1990s when america’s power market was substantially deregulated beginning in california</s>
<s>many utilities that previously handled three critical activities—energy generation transmission and distribution—were broken apart</s>
<s>seven regional transmission organisations were created across america each in effect an independent market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at roughly the same time laws prohibiting financial firms from entering the energy business were gradually relaxed at first to allow them into the business of energyrelated derivative contracts and then to help them manage risks better to own the physical products directly</s>
<s>about a dozen large financial firms and scores of small ones make an active market in electricity in america which is priced differently according to when it is required peak demand hours are more expensive and where</s>
<s>deutsche is accused of manipulating the market at a point when california’s supplies were tight barclays of manipulating the price of californian energy to enhance the price of various swap contracts it traded on the intercontinentalexchange ice an electronic market</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the current structure of the energy market is wildly complex</s>
<s>the regulatory filings suggest that insiders were themselves occasionally lost</s>
<s>it is unclear how much the cleverest judge or jury will be able to grasp and whether that will favour the government or the defendants</s>
<s>one lawyer reckons the cases will not go to court for at least a year and maybe as long as three</s>
<s>but if something is rotten about the market the best answer may be a simpler structure not more lawsuits</s>
