<p>
<s>all families have their secrets but this one was toxic—oppressive at home and isolating from everyone else</s>
<s>some suggest that all sons want to kill their fathers but few would care to witness a steady sickly insidious demise</s>
<s>as a thoughtful youth with a literary bent mr roth’s relationship with his father was fraught</s>
<s>in death the man casts an even more troubling shadow</s>
<s>in part this is because the story of his father’s infection may have been hiding an even darker secret a lifetime of subterfuge and sexual frustration</s>
<s>the mystery of the elder roth’s life lies at the heart of “the scientists”</s>

<p>
<s>an anxious child of jewish intellectuals mr roth learned to view love as something like the god of the old testament aggressive and impatient both demanding and remote</s>
<s>like a millstone he has carried his father’s temper and contempt into his own botched projects—a failed marriage and an abandoned phd a lifetime of discomfort and dislocation</s>
<s>with the patience of the literary scholar he almost became he pores over his father’s favourite novels a “canon of disappointment and unhappiness” in search of clues about the man</s>
<s>some of the book’s richest moments are when mr roth uses the works of franz kafka and thomas mann to grasp sadly and lovingly at his father’s cryptic ghost</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all memoirs are in their way works of therapy opportunities to air grievances and cauterise wounds</s>
<s>so it is with this sentimental and confused journey which offers no big revelations or pat conclusions</s>
<s>but with the wisdom of a good reader and the humility of a lost soul mr roth sorts through the mess of his past—in order to plot his escape from it</s>
