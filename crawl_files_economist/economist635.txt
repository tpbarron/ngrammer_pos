<s>for 3000 years it was unknown—and that is what kept it safe</s>
<s>but so many people have visited the tomb of tutankhamun since howard carter a british archaeologist unearthed the steps leading down to the royal burialchamber in november 1922 that it is now in critical condition</s>
<s>shifting temperatures and humidity are affecting the delicate painted surfaces and conservation of the plasterwork has led to a buildup of salts under the plaster pushing it off the walls</s>
<s>in january 2011 zahi hawass then secretarygeneral of egypt’s supreme council of antiquities announced that the tomb would soon have to close until a solution was found</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr hawass lost his job soon after in the tumult that followed the overthrow of president hosni mubarak but a solution to the problem of egypt’s tombs and tourists may be at hand</s>
<s>ninety years after carter’s discovery on november 13th an exact facsimile of the royal tomb will be unveiled in cairo</s>
<s>replicas of delicate historic sites are becoming increasingly common facsimiles of the painted caves at lascaux in france and altamira in northern spain between them attract nearly 5000 visitors a day</s>
<s>and the digital technology used in creating threedimensional replicas is improving all the time see comparisons pictured</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tutankhamun facsimile is the most ambitious yet and is the work—and gift—of a madridbased artists’ workshop factum arte and a swiss philanthropic foundation</s>
<s>the workshop made its name in 2007 with a facsimile of veronese’s giant painting “the wedding at cana” which has been placed in its original location the palladian refectory of the church of san giorgio maggiore in venice</s>
<s>if making an exact colour reproduction of a painting is technically difficult copying a threedimensional object poses even more of a challenge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2009 factum arte’s founder adam lowe and his team spent five weeks in egypt making a forensic study of the tomb walls and sarcophagus</s>
<s>without touching the surface they made three different kinds of recordings laser scanning—which operates like a bar code reading—to record the surface detail whitelight scanning to capture the relief and a close examination of the decoration to match up the colours</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is a plan to erect the facsimile which weighs nearly four tonnes permanently in the valley of the kings</s>
<s>others may follow</s>
<s>factum arte’s first egyptian facsimile of the burialchamber of tuthmosis iii unveiled in 2003 has already had more than 3m visitors</s>
