<s>kevin rudds “community” cabinet meetings reveal the man who will dominate australias politics in 2010 as he leads the country to a general election</s>
<s>since he steered the labor party to power in 2007 mr rudd has held many such meetings in town halls schools and makeshift tents across the country</s>
<s>standing on stage his ministers seated on either side mr rudd warms locals with a personal story about their region then fields questions on almost any subject—from mental health to cyberbullying—like a sharpwitted circus ringmaster</s>

<s>australia was one of the few rich countries to weather the global downturn without slipping into recession in 2009</s>
<s>this will enable mr rudd to argue that labor and not the opposition is the safer bet through uncertain times ahead</s>

<p>
<s>then there is the symbolic kevin rudd who formally apologised to australias indigenous people in early 2008</s>
<s>it is just possible that mr rudd may end his first term in 2010 by plucking out another labor policy australias campaign to become a republic</s>
