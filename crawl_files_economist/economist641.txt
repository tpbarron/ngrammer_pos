<s>many say they now realise it has taken a 14yearold schoolgirl to teach pakistan the meaning of courage</s>
<s>back in 2009 malala yousafzai began chronicling the dark grip of the pakistani taliban on her homeland the pretty swat valley in the country’s north</s>
<s>she had a cleareyed conviction that girls had a right to an education something the taliban did their best to prevent even after their local rule was broken in an army offensive</s>
<s>she called the taliban “barbarians”</s>
<s>on october 9th the barbarians took their revenge shooting her in the head</s>
<s>she is now in a british hospital in birmingham with a specialist unit for war injuries</s>
<s>doctors are impressed by her resilience</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>back home says nusrat javed host of a popular political show “malala has liberated pakistan” pakistanis have voiced unprecedented anger against the pakistani taliban calling for the peaceful majority to reclaim the country’s destiny from guntoting headchopping extremists</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the question is whether political military and religious leaders have malala’s gumption</s>
<s>most condemned the attack without condemning the pakistani taliban</s>
<s>a few went further</s>
<s>the army chief general ashfaq kayani who had already taken a more aggressive stance against extremists in recent months sounded ready for action</s>
<s>after visiting malala in hospital in pakistan he said “we refuse to bow before terror</s>
<s>we will fight regardless of the cost</s>
<s>we will prevail”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the obvious military response would be to go after the pakistani taliban in their stronghold of north waziristan part of the lawless tribal areas that border afghanistan</s>
<s>the united states has long urged the army to go after extremists there</s>
<s>the government coalition led by president asif ali zardari’s pakistan peoples party ppp also proposed a resolution calling for presumably military “practical measures” in response to the attack on malala</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is all starting to look like the highwater mark of courage</s>
<s>no national consensus exists about whether to fight the homegrown taliban or in some unexplained way to make peace with them</s>
<s>on october 16th the main opposition party led by a former prime minister nawaz sharif opposed the government’s resolution demanding proof that earlier military operations had not weakened the country rather than strengthened it</s>
<s>the ppp balked and dropped its proposal</s>
<s>with an election due in the next few months politicians of all stripes are cautious about advocating operations against extremists that could result in a violent blowback across pakistan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>besides the army appears not to have a plan and rationale for going into north waziristan</s>
<s>past military operations in the tribal areas including in swat have not cleared them of extremists</s>
<s>the operations were often halfhearted leaving the tribal people deeply cynical of the army’s intentions</s>
<s>after all the army has long used jihadists as its proxy warriors</s>
<s>awkwardly the leadership of the swat branch of the pakistani taliban is based not in north waziristan but in afghanistan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and now stung by the opprobrium the taliban is lashing out</s>
<s>pakistani journalists are under serious threat while international news organisations are lying low or scaling back their operations in islamabad the capital</s>
<s>a smear campaign by religious conservatives has begun against malala painting her as some kind of “american agent”</s>
<s>and on october 15th over 100 taliban attacked a police station near the northwestern city of peshawar</s>
<s>after killing the local police chief and five of his men they sliced off his head and took it away as a trophy</s>
