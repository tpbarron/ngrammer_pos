<s>in tokyo last week the bigwigs of international finance paid close attention to a speech by ben bernanke chairman of america’s federal reserve</s>
<s>his speech urged them in effect to pay less attention</s>
<s>many policymakers in emerging markets complain that fed easing destabilises their economies contributing to higher inflation and asset prices</s>
<s>mr bernanke pointed out that emerging economies can insulate themselves from his decisions by simply decoupling their currencies from the dollar</s>
<s>it is their habit of shadowing america’s currency however loosely that obliges emerging economies to ease monetary policy whenever he does</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>policymakers may heed mr bernanke’s words—freeing them to ignore his decisions—sooner than he thinks</s>
<s>in a more thinly attended speech on the same day a deputy governor of china’s central bank pointed out that china no longer hoovers up dollar reserves with its past abandon</s>
<s>and according to a new study by arvind subramanian and martin kessler of the peterson institute for international economics in washington dc the dollar’s influence is waning in the emerging world</s>
<s>currencies that used to shadow the greenback are no longer following it so closely</s>
<s>some are floating more freely</s>
<s>but in other cases they are steadily falling under the spell of a different currency the yuan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some inflationprone emerging economies such as ecuador have adopted the dollar as their official currency</s>
<s>others such as jordan peg their exchange rate to it</s>
<s>these official policies are one measure of the dollar’s international role</s>
<s>messrs subramanian and kessler use a different measure based on the way exchange rates behave in the market</s>
<s>they identify currencies that tend to move in sympathy with the dollar in its daily fluctuations against a third currency such as the swiss franc</s>
<s>this “comovement” could reflect market forces not official policies</s>
<s>it need not be a perfect correlation</s>
<s>it need only be close enough to rule out coincidence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>based on this measure the dollar still exerts a significant pull over 31 of the 52 emergingmarket currencies in their study</s>
<s>but a number of countries including india malaysia the philippines and russia appear to have slipped anchor since the financial crisis</s>
<s>comparing the past two years with the precrisis years from july 2005 to july 2008 they show that the dollar’s influence has declined in 38 cases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the greenback has in the past played a dominant role in east asia</s>
<s>but if anything the region is now on a yuan standard</s>
<s>seven currencies in the region now follow the yuan or redback more closely than the green see chart</s>
<s>when the dollar moves by 1 east asia’s currencies move in the same direction by 038 on average</s>
<s>when the yuan moves they shift by 053</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course the yuan does not yet float freely itself</s>
<s>since june 2010 it has climbed by about 9 against the dollar fluctuating within narrow daily bands</s>
<s>its close relationship with the greenback poses a statistical conundrum for messrs subramanian and kessler</s>
<s>how can they tell if a currency is following in the dollar’s footsteps or the yuan’s if those two currencies are moving in close step with each other</s>
<s>in previous studies wherever this ambiguity arose currencies were assumed to be following the dollar</s>
<s>the authors relax this assumption arguing that the yuan now moves independently enough to allow them to distinguish its influence</s>
<s>but some of the yuan’s apparent prominence may still be the dollar’s reflected glory</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>outside east asia the redback’s influence is still limited</s>
<s>when the dollar moves by 1 emergingmarket currencies move by 045 on average</s>
<s>in response to the yuan they move by only 019</s>
<s>but china’s currency will continue to grow in stature as its economy and trading activity grow in size</s>
<s>based on these two forces alone china’s currency should surpass the dollar as a key currency some time around 2035 mr subramanian guesses</s>
<s>by that point the fed chairman will be the one pulling in the smaller audiences</s>
