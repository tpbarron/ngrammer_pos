<s>“boris boris” chanted the throng of 60000 corralled into hyde park celebrating the start of the olympics as if it were pompey’s triumph after thwacking king hiarbas of numidia</s>
<s>“zoink” said boris johnson london’s mayor before launching an encomium to his city punctuated with a gag about bankrupt europeans and a dig at another conservative</s>
<s>“i hear there’s a guy called mitt romney who wants to know whether we’re ready” he said playing out a scene from “love actually” a schmaltzy film in which a british prime minister says boo to an american president</s>
<s>“yes we are” boris answered himself misquoting another president</s>
<s>as often with mr johnson it was hard to tell how serious he was being</s>
<s>for just as mr romney is auditioning for a nonfictional role as president so boris is trying out for the part of prime minister</s>
<s>it is going rather well</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>betting markets have mr johnson joint favourite with the chancellor george osborne to be the next tory leader</s>
<s>those odds probably flatter mr osborne who is about as popular as a chancellor trying to force through spending cuts in the midst of a recession can expect to be</s>
<s>a survey published this week on conservative home a website for fanatics put mr johnson miles ahead of anyone else when it asked readers who they would like to lead the party after david cameron</s>
<s>this question is not as theoretical as it might seem</s>
<s>if he loses the next election mr cameron is likely to resign</s>
<s>if he wins his departure would be delayed only by a couple of years mr cameron has repeatedly said that he does not want to serve more than two terms</s>
<s>and then</s>
<s>boris could be handed the power to send the tanks into persia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>given this mr johnson’s political beliefs are more interesting today than they were in 2001 when he became mp for henley a corner of oxfordshire where the conundrum over whether or not to take off jacket and tie in hot weather counts as a social problem or in 2008 when he became mayor of london where his power is mostly limited to transport and policing</s>
<s>the difficulty here is not that mr johnson has been coy about what he thinks but that in 25 years as a journalist and frequent public speaker he has collected so many enthusiasms</s>
<s>it is also easy to confuse a conviction with what is merely a good setup for a joke</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>through thousands of pages of newspaper columns a novel a couple of history books and a sortof memoir runs a thread of ideas that make mr johnson an unlikely favourite for grassroots conservatives</s>
<s>true it is hard to find a single instance in the johnson oeuvre in which the author favours a bigger state</s>
<s>on economic matters he is a true thatcherite</s>
<s>but on many other things his views are closer to those found in liberal urban britain and the offices of the economist than in south oxfordshire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>like mr cameron mr johnson spent his teenage years wandering around eton in a white bow tie</s>
<s>but before that he went to the same staterun primary school as ed miliband the labour leader</s>
<s>in a country where schooling is the most legible mark of privilege that matters</s>
<s>mr johnson is also cosmopolitan</s>
<s>he talks often about his turkish grandfather and slightly less often about his father’s work at the european commission and his grandfather’s tenure as president of the european commission of human rights</s>
<s>an enthusiasm for immigration which has included advocating an amnesty for some illegal migrants stems as much from his family tree as from his position as mayor of london</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even on europe the issue dearest to the tory right mr johnson is not quite what he seems</s>
<s>his inner columnist enjoys lampooning the absurdities of brussels bureaucracy and scorning dreams of further european integration</s>
<s>he has signed a pledge in favour of granting a simple inorout referendum on britain’s relationship with europe devised by people who want to get out</s>
<s>yet in “friends voters countrymen” an account of his henley campaign mr johnson writes that eu membership “has brought palpable benefits to britain” and that withdrawal would mean “a potentially worrying loss of influence”</s>
<s>boris makes europhobic tories laugh so hard that they assume he must be one of them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it’s morning in islington</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an ability to persuade a party that you belong to its tribe while saying things it disagrees with is a useful skill</s>
<s>both ronald reagan and tony blair had it to burn</s>
<s>mr johnson has some too</s>
<s>he is also a good campaigner winning reelection this may in london a place with an inbuilt labour majority at a time when the conservatives were trailing in national polls</s>
<s>it is easy enjoyable even to imagine him as leader of the conservative party</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>prime minister is a stretch</s>
<s>this is partly a question of electoral maths</s>
<s>mr johnson can charm labourleaning londoners but is likely to struggle in the less freewheeling north</s>
<s>he seems too chaotic to be at the centre of power</s>
<s>the people who want to have their pictures taken with him may not want him in charge of the nhs</s>
<s>he is not immune to fibbing when cornered</s>
<s>michael howard then the conservative leader sacked him from the shadow cabinet for lying about an affair</s>
<s>yet some of these objections were made before he won his first term as mayor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>voters think of mr johnson as the opposite of the modern politician who carefully calibrates what he says to please each audience</s>
<s>this gives him permission to do things that other politicos cannot and to laugh off setbacks</s>
<s>sometimes the bluster fails his walkabouts after the london riots last year were hard to watch</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but mr johnson is broadly brilliant at shaping how people think of him</s>
<s>orwell wrote that autobiography is only to be trusted if it reveals something disgraceful about the author</s>
<s>in all his writing mr johnson has never disgraced himself despite an abundance of material</s>
<s>the peculiar lexicon and tousled persona is as artificial in its way as anything mitt romney has to offer</s>
<s>which suggests boris can take it in any direction he likes</s>
