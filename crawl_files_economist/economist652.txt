<s>in the 1930s the federal reserve stood by as the economy sank into depression</s>
<s>retribution followed as franklin roosevelt concentrated more of its governance in washington dc</s>
<s>todays fed under its chairman ben bernanke has been hyperactive in preventing another depression yet again faces political peril</s>
<s>in 2010 critics in congress will seek to rein in its independence even as its defenders in the obama administration push to expand its regulatory powers</s>

<s>though its battle against the financial crisis and recession was heroic the fed is blamed for two previous blunders</s>
<s>first its easy monetary policy in 200304 arguably inflated a housing bubble</s>
<s>second and less debatable the fed was at best an intermittent at worst a negligent regulator it did too little to restrain reckless mortgage lending and allowed financial giants such as citigroup to acquire nearly fatal levels of poorly understood risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>no one has a coherent solution for preventing bubbles with monetary policy</s>
<s>but on the second point many in congress would like to strip the fed of oversight of banks</s>
<s>timothy geithner the treasury secretary and a former fed official wont let that happen</s>
<s>but nor will he succeed in extending the feds reach beyond banks to any big risky firm unless it shares that power with other regulators</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile ron paul a texas republican and strident critic of the fed will succeed in opening the feds lending and monetarypolicy decisions to congressional oversight</s>
<s>but he will compromise on the details so that the feds effectiveness wont be hurt much</s>
<s>some would like to go further by changing fed governance in particular reducing the relative independence of its 12 reserve banks</s>
<s>this is so politically explosive one must hope and assume that it will not happen</s>
