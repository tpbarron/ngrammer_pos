<s>it is too early to declare victory against somali piracy which cost the shipping industry and governments as much as $7 billion last year</s>
<s>but the fall in the number of successful hijackings since the peak of 200911 has been dramatic</s>
<s>the international maritime bureau a body that fights shipping crime counted 219 cases of pirates trying to board a vessel in 2010 and 236 in 2011</s>
<s>this year’s total is just 71 against 199 for the same period last year</s>
<s>successful seizures are down from 49 in 2010 to 28 in 2011 and only 13 this year</s>

<s>pirate activity normally wanes between the end of may and late september when the southwest monsoon is lashing the arabian sea and this year’s storms were particularly severe</s>
<s>the light skiffs launched from bigger “mother ships” that the pirates use to close on their prey can only operate in benign sea conditions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the pirate lairs along the somali coast show little sign of preparing for a new hunting season</s>
<s>associated press reporters who reached one of them hobyo found that the pirates’ flashy cars booze and prostitutes had disappeared and the cash for new raids had dried up</s>
<s>some think the pirate “kingpins” may just be stocktaking before reinvesting</s>
<s>but the “stock” of hijacked vessels and hostages has shrunk from 33 ships and 758 hostages in early 2011 to just nine ships and 154 hostages now</s>
<s>some of these have proved hard to ransom and have been there a long time</s>

<p>
<s>tom patterson a maritimesecurity expert at control risks a consultancy points to three factors that have made piracy a lot riskier and less profitable</s>
<s>the first is that soaring insurance premiums and the threat to crews have forced shipowners to change their ways</s>
<s>ships have been made harder to attack by a range of measures known as bmp or best management practice</s>
<s>they cruise faster and practise evasive manoeuvres</s>
<s>physical barriers such as razor wire are now fitted</s>
<s>many have secure “citadels” on board for the crews to retreat to if all else fails</s>
<s>they also follow the reporting protocols established by the european union’s naval taskforce eu navfor when crossing dangerous waters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second factor he cites is better coordination by the international naval taskforces</s>
<s>these include the eu flotilla a similar one provided by nato an americanled coalition and warships under national commands from china japan india iran russia and saudi arabia</s>
<s>these all meet four times a year to discuss tactics and make better use of the intelligence coming from surveillance aircraft and somalis who want to be rid of the pirates</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the legal issues around fighting pirates are still tricky</s>
<s>but the foreign naval forces have become more assertive</s>
<s>on october 11th an eu vessel arrested seven pirates because their dhow was carrying ladders and a large quantity of fuel and water drums</s>
<s>pirate mother ships now face preemptive boarding and skiffs are destroyed rather than ordered home as happened in the past</s>
<s>mr patterson highlights the psychological importance of a strike in may by helicopters from eu navfor on targets near haradheere a pirate haven</s>
<s>it destroyed fuel outboards and speedboats</s>
<s>the force’s spokesperson lieutenant commander jacqueline sherrif says that disrupting logistics on land “sends a strong message” to the pirates and their investors who now know “they will no longer have impunity on the beaches”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>however both mr patterson and rear admiral anthony rix now of salamanca risk management say that the biggest game changer of all is probably a third factor</s>
<s>mr patterson reckons that more than a quarter of vessels now carry armed security guards</s>
<s>the shipping industry used to oppose this fearing that armed guards would escalate violence</s>
<s>but not a single vessel with guards has been boarded</s>
<s>usually a warning shot is enough to deter the pirates</s>
<s>lieutcommander sherrif says “the pirates go to sea to make money not die in a firefight” bimco the biggest international shipping organisation has recently produced a standard contract for the industry known as guardcon</s>
<s>most of the security firms supplying guards are british</s>
<s>admiral rix says that his company hires mostly former royal marines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nobody in the antipiracy effort believes that a return to the epidemic levels of the past is likely but some worry that complacency could allow the pirates to make a limited comeback</s>
<s>the shipping industry is in recession and under huge cost pressure</s>
<s>defence budgets are under strain too the political will to support constant naval patrolling in the indian ocean may weaken</s>
<s>as admiral rix notes “the pirates’ business model is still attractive</s>
<s>it would be naive to think that the current low level of activity suggests that they have found something else to do”</s>
