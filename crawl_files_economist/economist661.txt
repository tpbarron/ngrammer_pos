<s>it is a political truism that incumbents win with a strong economy and lose in tough times</s>
<s>by this measure how does barack obama fare</s>
<s>the economist tracked his performance in terms of growth and unemployment for the 18 months before election day and compared it against all postwar reelection bids</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>looking at gdp first chart the latest growth figure 21 puts mr obama much closer to the records of losing candidates and below their average</s>
<s>only one incumbent dwight eisenhower in 1956 won with an economy growing more slowly</s>
<s>the situation is even grimmer when it comes to joblessness second chart</s>
<s>even at the recently improved rate of 78 mr obama faces the worst rate of any incumbent for more than 50 years</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but mr obama can take a crumb of comfort too</s>
<s>growth may be pretty much flat though at least not falling as with past losers but the unemployment rate has fallen from more than 9 over this period</s>
<s>that is a performance in line with those of incumbents who won</s>
