<s>arriving in birmingham’s moor street station visitors see something odd a grand romancolumned stone building seemingly abandoned in a wasteland of tarmac and grass</s>
<s>this neoclassical remnant curzon street station was the original terminus of the london and birmingham railway opened in 1838</s>
<s>it closed to passengers 55 years later having proved too inconvenient</s>
<s>like many of the 19thcentury buildings in birmingham’s eastside it has been derelict ever since</s>

<p>
<s>despite an efflorescence of striking architecture both old and modern britain’s secondbiggest city is not doing well</s>
<s>some 14 of the population is unemployed the highest level in any big city in the country</s>
<s>in the innercity wards of aston and washwood heath the figure is higher than 30</s>
<s>twofifths of birmingham’s population live in areas classified as in the 10 most deprived parts of england</s>
<s>the city’s infant mortality rate is strikingly high around 60 worse than the national average</s>

<p>
<s>birmingham has had lots of bad luck</s>
<s>german bombs destroyed much of the old city centre disastrous postwar planning strangled it with a concrete ring road</s>
<s>then came deindustrialisation</s>
<s>by 1971 “the city of a thousand trades” had become a sort of british detroit employing tens of thousands of car workers</s>
<s>when militant unions and incompetent management destroyed the auto industry birmingham was hit brutally</s>
<s>carmaking in britain is now thriving again—but much less of it is in birmingham</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the city has tried to reinvent itself as a business and tourism hub</s>
<s>it has built a convention centre an opera house and a spectacular shopping mall</s>
<s>that has made the city a more pleasant place to live but it has not replaced lost manufacturing jobs</s>
<s>between 1998 and 2008 the city lost some 61000 privatesector jobs according to the centre for cities a thinktank</s>
<s>since around 2004 gross valueadded—a measure of output—has lagged see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>demography is a structural challenge</s>
<s>some 22 of birmingham’s population is under the age of 15 which puts the city on a par with vietnam</s>
<s>though that may become an asset it puts pressure on public services</s>
<s>only 25 of the workingage population have degreelevel qualifications in contrast to the 38 who do in manchester</s>
<s>thanks primarily to the city’s conservative pakistani population just 49 of women have jobs against 65 nationally</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the real cause of birmingham’s secondclass status is a history of indifferent management</s>
<s>the city’s government was once mighty and dynamic enough to produce joseph chamberlain a mayor who went on to become one of victorian britain’s most powerful men</s>
<s>over the years westminster power grabs have diluted the power and legitimacy of britain’s provincial councils</s>
<s>in manchester where the council has been led by the same two men since 1998 this trend has been partly resisted</s>
<s>birmingham’s more changeable government has proved less capable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>take the city’s shoddy publictransport system which is mostly provided by private bus companies</s>
<s>unlike london and manchester the city has been slow to organise its transport investment on a cityregion level</s>
<s>as a result it can be quicker to get to london than around birmingham’s suburbs</s>
<s>many of the bestpaid workers live in dormitory towns like bromsgrove or lichfield from where they can at least get to work by train</s>
<s>others such as sir albert bore the new labour council leader face grinding daily commutes by car</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>birmingham is bad at getting its message across</s>
<s>many british people now seem to think that manchester is britain’s secondbiggest city</s>
<s>the decision by the bbc to close pebble mill a big production centre even as it expanded in salford near manchester has not helped</s>
<s>embarrassingly the city has repeatedly failed to win competitions to become a “capital of culture”—most recently losing to derry londonderry to the unionists a small city in northern ireland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>reviving birmingham’s fortunes will require a sharp change in direction says gisela stuart a local mp</s>
<s>she argues that the city missed an opportunity when it rejected an elected mayor in a referendum in may</s>
<s>such a highprofile figure could have pushed through radical reforms</s>
<s>the council by contrast is hamstrung by the need to cut £600m $960m from its £35 billion budget—a necessity forced onto it by a government formula which is hard on big deprived cities</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are hopeful signs including birmingham’s improving schools</s>
<s>several academies—independent of the local authority—have opened including one run by the king edward vi foundation which manages the city’s remaining grammar schools</s>
<s>schools still under council control are busy forging links with local firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in manchester a second airport runway helped attract privatesector investment in the 1990s</s>
<s>birmingham is finally catching up</s>
<s>a longer runway will allow the city’s airport to offer direct flights to east asia</s>
<s>when a planned highspeed rail link opens in 2026 the airport will be just 40 minutes from london by train says paul kehoe its chief executive</s>
<s>eventually he hopes the annual passenger flow could increase from 9m now to as much as 36m</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>new plans could help birmingham’s eastside too</s>
<s>after passing through the airport the highspeed link is to terminate at a reopened curzon street station</s>
<s>the city’s leaders hope that will be the final touch to their “big city plan” to regenerate the eastside</s>
<s>a new park is to be built on the wasteland while the crumbling station at new street is to be overhauled</s>
<s>an entire quarter of the city has been designated an “enterprise zone” with tax relief and simplified planning to lure investment</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>when curzon street opened the railway allowed birmingham to sell its products to the world</s>
<s>later under chamberlain’s leadership it harnessed private capital to build the city’s infrastructure</s>
<s>the current leadership wants to repeat the trick but without anywhere near the resources or the power</s>
<s>it’s a tall order</s>
