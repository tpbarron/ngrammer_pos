<s>a curious paradox will reveal itself during 2010 in france</s>
<s>as he enters the second half of his fiveyear term president nicolas sarkozy will remain unpopular in the polls</s>
<s>his critics and the leftwing media will demonise him</s>
<s>the slightest faux pas will be derided</s>
<s>joblessness and social tension will rise</s>
<s>all will contribute to a sense of a president under pressure</s>
<s>and yet mr sarkozy will emerge stronger than ever</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how so</s>
<s>the centreright leader will put the finishing touches to a project that for the first time under the fifth republic has united the political right under a single umbrella</s>
<s>barring the farright national front which mr sarkozy has in effect crushed this movement will reach from rightwing nationalists to socialist defectors from the moderate left</s>
<s>within this broad church he will face not a single credible rival</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by occupying such a wide political space and borrowing both ideas and manpower from the opposition mr sarkozy will deny his opponents breathing room</s>
<s>the socialists will be marginalised by their internal rivalry</s>
<s>ever flakier ségolène royal who is not the partys leader will behave as if she is already its candidate for the 2012 presidential election</s>
<s>torpedoing her own party bosses to project an outsiderish quality ms royal will establish herself as mr sarkozys foremost opponent—but will not be an immediate threat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to curb the rise of the ecologists mr sarkozy will apply his suffocation tactics to them too</s>
<s>his carbon tax will come into effect and he will press for a similar tax at europes borders prompting cries of protectionism from freetraders</s>
<s>he will push the development of the electric car and nonbiodegradable plastic bags will be banned from supermarkets from january</s>
<s>four new tgv highspeed rail lines will be under construction at the same time</s>
<s>the government will launch a “super bond” to retail investors with investment in the carbonfree economy as one of its themes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a test of mr sarkozys strength will be elections in frances 22 regions in march</s>
<s>the socialists who swept the board last time are set to lose control of several regions—though ms royal is likely to hang on to hers</s>
<s>if mr sarkozys party can win back even half of them that would be a strong springboard from which to plan for 2012</s>
<s>unless françois fillon gets a big european job mr sarkozy may not need to change his prime minister mr fillons patrician discretion complements the presidents showmanship</s>
<s>if a new prime minister were needed candidates could include surprises such as christine lagarde the finance minister or even eric besson a socialist defector as well as oldtime sarkozy chums such as brice hortefeux</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although the economy will start to revive mr sarkozy will not return to his onetime liberal discourse in a hurry</s>
<s>this will disappoint those including his own business friends who thought they had elected a liberal reformer</s>
<s>he will clash with european friends over running a high budget deficit</s>
<s>but he will try to make some structural changes</s>
<s>the retirement age will be raised</s>
<s>hospital charges will increase</s>
<s>a big administrative reform will halve the number of elected departmental and regional representatives</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>sharm offensive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there will be further scattered unrest at the factory gate yet frances generous welfare provision will keep spending buoyant and café trade brisk</s>
<s>the unions will find it harder than in the past to draw vast numbers onto the streets</s>
<s>more unpredictable are the heavily muslim immigrant neighbourhoods where drugs and gangs create a toxic mix</s>
<s>on grounds of security as well as secularism the french may well go ahead and ban the burqa the facecovering islamic garment in public places</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fifty years after france first granted its african colonies independence mr sarkozy will celebrate “africa year” convening a grand franceafrica summit in sharm elsheikh</s>
<s>but he will all the same shrink frances military presence in subsaharan africa and reorient it towards the horn of africa and the gulf</s>
<s>more generally mr sarkozy will veer between atlanticism and more gaullist reflexes as france marks the 70th anniversary of de gaulles london appeal for wartime resistance</s>
<s>he will push his ideas on financial regulation climate change iran and the middle east</s>
<s>but relations with america will be pricklier than expected partly because his pretensions to bigpower status irk washington</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by the end of the year the chameleonlike mr sarkozy will face hard questions</s>
<s>his promises to get the french to work more and the state to do less have gone untested during the recession</s>
<s>the more the economy recovers the fewer excuses mr sarkozy will have for not adopting the reformist agenda that got him elected</s>
