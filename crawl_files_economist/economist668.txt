<s>the arguments had been rumbling on for months</s>
<s>but negotiations between the city of chicago and its teachers’ union finally came to an end on september 9th</s>
<s>just a week after the city’s children returned from their long summer break their teachers began their first strike in chicago for 25 years</s>
<s>about 25000 teachers have stopped work keeping 350000 pupils out of school</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mayor rahm emanuel is now in an unenviable position</s>
<s>improving chicago’s disastrous school system where four in ten children fail to graduate is one of his main priorities</s>
<s>in negotiations over a new contract for teachers his demands have been reasonable</s>
<s>he wants the school day lengthened to seven hours for elementary children for teachers to work 38 weeks a year and to be able to introduce differentiated pay</s>
<s>this is a mix of performancebased pay and extra pay for working in jobs that are hard to fill and for taking leadership roles</s>
<s>in return for all this teachers have been offered an average salary increase of 16 costing $320m over the next four years</s>
<s>which given the state of city finances and a deficit in the school system of $1 billion will be a squeeze</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>over the past eight years chicago teachers have done well securing raises averaging 7 a year with no changes to their terms</s>
<s>the main sticking points now are teacher evaluations compensation and the rehiring of teachers who have been laid off</s>
<s>these last two issues are the most significant hurdles mr emanuel would like schools to be able to hire the best teachers not the most recentlyfired ones</s>
<s>but to keep the strike legal the unions must insist that it is about nothing more than pay and benefits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the timing could hardly be worse politically speaking</s>
<s>the strike is awkward for mr emanuel’s former boss barack obama whom he served as chief of staff</s>
<s>chicago a stronghold for unions is both the hometown of the president as well as the base of his reelection campaign</s>
<s>mr obama has sought exactly the same kind of reforms nationally but union support is also crucial to his reelection providing donations and grassroots activists</s>
<s>so cautiously he has declined to take a position</s>
<s>mr emanuel has some ammunition left including the prospect of school closures and increased numbers of charter schools</s>
<s>introducing vouchers though would be too much of a hot potato even for him</s>
