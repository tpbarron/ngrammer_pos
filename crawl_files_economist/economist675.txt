<s>in his singsong praise for england’s trees rudyard kipling declared that the ash would grace the country “till judgment tide”</s>
<s>britain’s 80m ash trees may not last so long</s>
<s>a fungal disease chalara fraxinea is spreading through the land having laid waste to ash trees in pockets of continental europe</s>
<s>as the number of affected sites climbs the government has declared a crisis destroying contaminated trees banning imports and calling emergency summits</s>
<s>but scientists are pessimistic</s>
<s>the disease lacks a vaccine or a cure</s>

<p>
<s>the fingerpointing has begun</s>
<s>forestry groups say the government was notified of the fungus as early as 2009 when disease broke out in france having spread through the baltics scandinavia and eastern europe</s>
<s>a domestic epidemic should have seemed inevitable</s>
<s>the horticultural trades association which represents the gardening industry is demanding that the taxpayer compensates growers for an ash crop once worth millions of pounds that is now useless</s>

<s>owen paterson the environment secretary retorts that the government has “taken the right action at the right time”</s>
<s>civil servants blame eu trade rules which prevent bans on agricultural imports if the offending pathogen is already widespread at home</s>
<s>the fatal disease was originally presumed to be an organism that had long been benign in britain</s>
<s>scientists discovered that the fungus was unique as early as 2010 so the ban introduced on october 30th seems overdue</s>
<s>and yet because the disease travels by airborne spores a strong wind from the continent would have put eastcoast forests at risk regardless</s>

<s>the problem goes beyond ash trees</s>
<s>imports of “instant landscapes” are on the rise such as the birch orchard that suddenly took root near heathrow’s terminal 3 international trade in plants—and a taste for exotic and mature species—is putting local greenery at risk says joan webber the head of tree health at the forestry commission</s>
<s>eleven new diseases have come ashore since 2000 compared with five during the whole of the previous century</s>
<s>earlier this year scientists discovered a fungus that afflicts sweet chestnut trees in orchards sourced from france</s>
<s>a new and undiagnosed pathogen appears to be terrorising the scots pine</s>

<p>
<s>all this comes at a time of dwindling national expertise in plant diseases</s>
<s>britain counts fewer than ten plantpathology experts who specialise in trees and universities offer ever fewer classes on the subject according to the british society for plant pathology bspp</s>
<s>the slow painstaking work of fungus testing lacks both the funding and the sex appeal of say genomics says michael shaw a plant pathologist at reading university and presidentelect of the bspp</s>
<s>this makes it hard to move quickly in the case of new diseases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on november 9th after another crisis meeting the government will call for more landscape surveys more volunteers and more awareness</s>
<s>but without a new crop of trained plant pathologists it will be hard to control what will surely be a rise in new pests and diseases</s>
<s>in the meantime the future looks bleak for the tree of life of nordic myth</s>
