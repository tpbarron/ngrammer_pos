<s>this week police in kudankulam in southern tamil nadu fired at thousands of antinuclear protesters on the beach killing a fisherman</s>
<s>the locals were opposing a new russiandesigned 2000mw nuclear plant india’s biggest which is now being filled with fuel</s>
<s>the 2004 indian ocean tsunami killed over 10000 indians</s>
<s>now fears grow of another big wave that could bring a fukushimastyle disaster</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>protesters also claim harassment saying officials have slapped sedition notices against 8000 who have dared speak out</s>
<s>opposition has flared before</s>
<s>the state’s chief minister jayaram jayalalitha once backed the protests but has now swung in favour of the plant—perhaps betting that anger over power shortages trumps antinuclear outbursts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the reaction of the national government under the prime minister manmohan singh has been mixed</s>
<s>committees of investigation called the plant safe</s>
<s>the high court in chennai heard and ruled against a petition by locals over safety</s>
<s>the supreme court will hear an appeal</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the government’s argument that politicians not protesters should decide the country’s energy mix is reasonable</s>
<s>but twitchy at criticism it veered off in suggesting opponents merely did the bidding of a foreign hand</s>
<s>mr singh in an interview with a science magazine in february blamed protests on ngos “mostly i think based in the united states”</s>
<s>a tough new law is in force severely restricting foreign money going to local ngos</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr singh’s frostiness is best understood in the context of america’s moans that a civilnuclear deal signed with india has not led to american investors getting energy contracts</s>
<s>strict liability laws scare its private investors whereas governmentbacked ones such as russians feel more secure</s>
<s>could mr singh be implying that american activists are stirring the trouble in kudankulam because the plant is russianbuilt</s>
