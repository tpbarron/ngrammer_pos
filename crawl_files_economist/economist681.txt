<s>america seems to have a twosizefitsall view of business</s>
<s>the country is home to many of the world’s biggest firms which increasingly look abroad for growth</s>
<s>meanwhile the engines of growth at home according to a new conventional wisdom are the hundreds of thousands of small businesses whose struggles in recent years have become a focus for policymakers</s>
<s>yet this binary bigorsmall discussion leaves out an important third party midsized firms which even in the difficult past few years have performed impressively creating lots of new jobs see chart</s>

<s>america has around 197000 mediumsized firms defined as those with annual revenues between $10m and $1 billion according to data from the national centre for the middle market at ohio state university</s>
<s>together they employ over 40m people in the country and account for around onethird of privatesector gdp equivalent to the economies of india and russia combined</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some 82 of mediumsized firms survived the dark years of 200710 compared with 57 of small firms</s>
<s>and although the survival rate among the 2100 big firms with revenue over $1 billion was 97 these giants shed 37m jobs during those years</s>
<s>midsized companies by contrast added 22m jobs</s>
<s>this trend has continued as the economy has struggled back to its feet</s>
<s>in 201011 mediumsized firms increased employment by 38 compared with growth of 25 by small firms and 08 by big business</s>

<s>america’s midsized firms have much in common with the mittelstand businesses that are admired see article as the engine of germany’s economy</s>
<s>they are concentrated in the industrial heartland rather as mittelstand firms are in southern germany</s>
<s>they have typically been around a while the average age is 31 years</s>
<s>and they tend to be privately owned 31 by a family and a further 40 by some combination of private equity and family</s>
<s>only 14 are traded on a stockmarket</s>
<s>by contrast twothirds of big firms are publicly owned</s>
<s>the freedom from shortterm stockmarket pressures is one reason why middling firms have been more willing to invest for the long term despite the tough economy says anil makhija who runs the national centre for the middle market</s>

<s>lately they have done strikingly well in industries where a dominant big firm has run into trouble</s>
<s>in the motorvehicle parts industry in 201011 after lear corp filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection its mediumsized competitors such as standard motor products in long island city increased their combined revenue by 13 and their employment from 106000 to 147000</s>
<s>after borders was liquidated in 2011 mediumsized booksellers such as books a million from alabama and half price books a texan chain have together increased employment by 41 to 49150</s>

<p>
<s>mr makhija has studied the fastestgrowing midsized firms to see what they were doing differently</s>
<s>they turn out to be more focused on what their customers want those with socialmedia strategies did especially well and to use more stateoftheart management methods</s>
<s>they also tend to be remarkably globalised again like mittelstand firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the biggest concerns of the executives surveyed quarterly by the national centre are regulation and access to growth capital they have plenty of working capital for ongoing operations having built up cash reserves just like their bigger corporate brethren</s>
<s>midsized firms tend to bear the heaviest burden of new regulations since smaller firms are often given some exemptions initially whereas bigger firms have legions of lawyers to cope with the additional rules</s>
<s>conversation among the 1000 or so middlemarket executives due to attend the national centre’s annual meeting on october 24th is expected to be dominated by worries about the new healthcare system</s>
<s>given the importance of mediumsized firms to the economy politicians might look more carefully at how they are affected by new laws</s>
