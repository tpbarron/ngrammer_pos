<s>britain with its large financial sector and its love of property speculation was supposed to be the big economy most vulnerable to the global financial crisis and in terms of the governments own budget this turned out to be true</s>
<s>but looking at the economy more broadly and especially at the surprising resilience of both consumer spending and business sentiment britains performance has come quite close to the rosier of the two scenarios outlined here a year ago “a commonorgarden recession followed by a decent recovery in the second half of the year driven by ultralow interest rates and a competitive exchange rate”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the four main questions for the year ahead are whether this recovery can continue what policies will be applied to help sustain it what permanent damage has been caused and what damagelimitation policies will be adopted by the new government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a positive answer can be offered to the first question with reasonable confidence because this recession has turned out to be surprisingly similar to previous ones</s>
<s>although the decline in gdp of 59 from peak to trough was much deeper than the 25 dip in 199091 the present downturn was marginally shallower than the 60 fall in 197981 and it has done less damage to employment retail sales business confidence and even inflationadjusted house prices than previous recessions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although unemployment will go on rising as it normally does after recessions are over the jobless figures are unlikely to reach the shockhorror 3m35m considered inevitable by many economists when 2009 began</s>
<s>assuming the jobless rate peaks at around 9 gordon browns recession will have been less painful for the public than the thatcher recession of 197981 after which unemployment more than doubled to 119 or even the major recession of 199091 when it peaked at 107 in 1993 and far more people lost their homes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>economic recoveries once they gain momentum almost always continue unless some external force suddenly intervenes</s>
<s>in fact there has never been a case of recovery spontaneously aborting in britain or america through lack of consumer demand</s>
<s>germany and japan by contrast have experienced several such interrupted recoveries largely because of employment arrangements that stretch out job losses over many years</s>
<s> on the rare occasions when british recoveries have aborted the reason was clear interest rates were drastically increased to ward off inflation or to “defend” sterling</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>which leads to the next question what policies will britain see in 2010</s>
<s>on the monetary side the bank of england has made its intentions unusually clear</s>
<s>interest rates will be kept at exceptionally low levels not just until economic growth is firmly reestablished but until there is significant shrinkage in the very large “output gap”</s>
<s>this is a measure of spare capacity and unemployment—and hence of potential deflationary pressures—favoured by many central banks</s>
<s>since no big reduction of the output gap is likely until 2011 interest rates will remain very low into 2011 and probably beyond</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the main damage done by the crisis the collapse of government finances is ironically another reason why british interest rates will remain at rockbottom levels much longer than businesses and homeowners generally expect</s>
<s>if the new government has the courage to attack the deficit it will expect low interest rates as a quid pro quo—and the bank of england will be happy to oblige since its internal models suggest monetary stimulus really will be needed to offset the deflationary effects of serious budget cuts</s>
<s>moreover such is the size of the hole in government finances that many years of fiscal retrenchment will be required</s>
<s>thus a combination of evertighter fiscal policy with surprisingly low interest rates will dominate british macroeconomic policy until the middle of the new decade</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the imperative of longterm fiscal retrenchment raises the final and most interesting question about britains prospects will politicians dare to undertake the fiscal tightening needed to stabilise public debt at a reasonable level</s>
<s>the retrenchment required can appear impossibly daunting</s>
<s>but the british government remains one of the worlds most creditworthy borrowers so it has the luxury of tackling its budgetary problems over several years</s>
<s>if the directors of any private company sent their department heads an instruction to cut costs by 2 a year without sacrificing customer service this would hardly be considered a managerial nightmare</s>
<s>any leader who could instil privatesector attitudes towards productivity growth and cost control into the management of the public sector would be hailed as the saviour of the british economy</s>
