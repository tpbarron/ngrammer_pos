<s>on october 1st 2009 with a massive display of military hardware the chinese communist party celebrated the 60th anniversary of the founding of the peoples republic</s>
<s>sixtieth birthdays are big ones in chinese culture—the culmination of a complete astrological cycle</s>
<s>so 2010 marks in a sense a new beginning</s>
<s>and for many chinese it is an extremely auspicious one the dawn of a 60year cycle during which china will become the worlds biggest economy and they believe its leading power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is of course gratifying for chinese nationalists</s>
<s>in the past two years that nationalism has acquired a shriller tone</s>
<s>its adherents have seen signs of the one missing factor that would make chinas ascendancy complete the corresponding decline of the west as capitalism has come close to collapse and as nato in afghanistan has looked a paper tiger</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>chinas leaders and officials grumble that some foreigners especially in the old seats of wealth and power in the west fear and resent their countrys resurgence and will do what they can to thwart it</s>
<s>they have a point</s>
<s>but so far their own behaviour as well as the online gloating of an ultranationalist fringe has done too little to reassure the outside world that chinas rise is something to be celebrated everywhere</s>
<s>with luck the coming year when shanghai hosts world expo 2010—“an occasion” runs the publicity “for the world to feel at home in china”—may see that begin to change</s>
<s>it certainly should</s>
<s>china needs to start feeling more at home in the world</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it would be surprising if chinas growing might did not create disquiet</s>
<s>in 2005 a report by americas national intelligence council likened its emergence in the early 21st century alongside that of india to the rise of germany in the 19th and america in the 20th with “impacts potentially as dramatic”</s>
<s>that already looks rather understated</s>
<s>these are after all the worlds two most populous countries</s>
<s>the entry of chinas workforce into the global marketplace has within a generation turned the world economy upside down</s>
<s>the demand of its increasingly wealthy consumers for the worlds resources will be among the biggest determinants of the planets future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the charm of softer power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet instead of seeking to soothe and reassure too often chinas leaders present their country as defensively assertive and angry</s>
<s>there are at least four areas where they should display a softer touch</s>
<s>one is in economic diplomacy</s>
<s>cheering their governments ability to buy sustained growth through an enormous fiscal stimulus they have also recognised that chinas full recovery from the global downturn relies on demand in the west</s>
<s>but they have continued to treat economic negotiation more as competition than collaboration</s>
<s>when in september 2009 america handed them a free pass to the moral high ground by imposing tariffs on tyre imports they risked worsening the damage with a threat of retaliation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>china also needs to accept that the tolerance it demands for different political and cultural standards should be reciprocal</s>
<s>to complain as it does to western governments that they allow their newspapers to print terrible things about china and their protesters to wave the flag of an independent tibet is to display wilful ignorance about western political systems</s>
<s>it is also selfdefeating witness the way in which china turned rebiya kadeer a littleknown exiled activist for the cause of chinas uighur minority into an international celebrity able to draw crowds wherever she travelled</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third chinas army needs to do more to convince the world that its acquisition of all that fearsome capability displayed in beijing in october really is not meant to threaten or intimidate</s>
<s>that requires much greater openness as well as refraining from provocations in space or cyberspace or on the high seas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>finally china seems also to have realised that helping to tackle climate change is in its interests</s>
<s>heavily populated and short of water northern china is in the frontline</s>
<s>yet china still seems reluctant to submit itself to global rules</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it wants it both ways to be accepted as a global leader—one half with america of the “g2”—and to be spared the costs that such a role entails</s>
<s>its time indeed for a new start</s>
