<s>in the world of technology it will feel like 1995 all over again</s>
<s>back then netscape the creator of a web browser staged an initial public offering ipo starting a fashion for flotations and a stockmarket bubble that eventually burst in 2000</s>
<s>in 2012 facebook will launch its own ipo</s>
<s>the flotation of the giant social network which pioneered “poking” as a way of saying hello to friends online will set off another rush to market by fledgling internet firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it wont just be facebook which now boasts over 800m users that excites investors</s>
<s>more big chinese web firms will seek listings in china in 2012</s>
<s>some of them will follow in the footsteps of outfits such as youku a youtube lookalike and renren a social network which have listed their shares in america</s>
<s>one company that could seek a flotation in the united states next year is jingdong mall an online retailing behemoth and dailydeals site that is also known as 360buycom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of course the state of the ipo market will depend heavily on the health of financial markets in general</s>
<s>a bumper global crop of internet ipos seemed in prospect in 2011 as before the summer mutual funds privateequity firms and other investors hungry for juicy returns drooled over web companies prospectuses</s>
<s>but only a few big web firms including linkedin a social network for professionals and pandora an internetradio company managed to go public as turmoil in the world economy scuppered other flotations</s>
<s>a fuss over questionable accounting practices at several chinese web companies listed on exchanges in america also dented confidence in their shares</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one of the things that has reduced the pressure on tech firms to stage swift ipos has been the growth of secondary markets in the shares of private companies such as facebook and twitter a microblogging service</s>
<s>these have allowed employees to sell equity stakes to wealthy investors without their employers having to stage a public offering</s>
<s>the snag with such trades is that they can distort the value of firms because buyers often do not have a full picture of a companys finances</s>
<s>moreover many tech investors and web entrepreneurs believe they are more likely to get the best price for their equity from public offerings rather than private deals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are other reasons why facebook will go public in 2012</s>
<s>one is that private trading in the firms equity has expanded the number of its shareholders to a point where in order to comply with american regulations facebook will have to publish detailed data about its financial performance</s>
<s>another is that it faces growing competition from the likes of google which has launched a rival service called google</s>
<s>facebook will want to seek a listing before rivals erode its lead in the socialnetworking sphere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cash call</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebook may well want to top the record of google which walked away with $17 billion when it went public in 2004 in a transaction valuing the search giant at more than $23 billion</s>
<s>as well as giving facebook mountains of cash to invest an epochmaking ipo will also have wider repercussions</s>
<s>it will give investors even more appetite for the shares of web companies that produce apps for social networks</s>
<s>it will encourage more startups to aim for ipos though sales to corporate buyers will remain the most popular way for venture capitalists to get their money back</s>
<s>and it will boost the valuations of other socialnetworking firms</s>
<s>all this will reignite a debate about whether the mania for socialnetworking sites is inflating another internet bubble</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>facebooks flotation will also encourage more investment in startups</s>
<s>after googles ipo some of its employees left the firm with croesuslike sums of money raised by selling their stakes</s>
<s>a number of these “xooglers” as former google workers are known have since ploughed back a chunk of their riches into new startups</s>
<s>after 2012 wealthy former facebook staffers—call them “xbookers”—will have an opportunity to do the same thing</s>
<s>they should make the most of it </s>
