<s>in december 2010 the 24 members of the executive committee of fifa world footballs governing body representing all corners of the soccer world will take part in an unprecedented series of votes</s>
<s>unprecedented because the chosen few including fifas swiss president sepp blatter will elect not one but two world cup hosts at the same sitting</s>
<s>after 18 months of lobbying horsetrading and analysis the white smoke will emerge and the hosts for the competitions in 2018 and 2022 will be named</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>competition is intense</s>
<s>australia england indonesia japan russia and the united states have all bid for both championships and there are joint bids from belgium with the netherlands and spain with portugal</s>
<s>qatar and south korea have submitted bids for 2022 only</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>having given up the formal rotation between continents that ushered in south africa and brazil as hosts for 2010 and 2014 respectively fifa faces a big choice</s>
<s>the new voting format should benefit the europeans who have nine members on the committee and who believe that one in every three world cups should be staged on their continent</s>
<s>after germany in 2006 the europeans will be eager to get one of their own installed for 2018</s>
<s>with its established stadiums and the leading global brand of premier league club football as well as the advantage of a simple singlecountry bid england is favourite to take the honour—more than 50 years after it last hosted the event in 1966</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the 2022 tournament is a tougher call</s>
<s>australia now part of the asian federation is a stronger continental challenger than either japan or korea the joint hosts in 2002</s>
<s>to the dismay of other sports notably tennis soccers growth has been rapid in australia which offers fifa an attractive new market</s>
<s>the small gasrich gulf state of qatar has its merits too not least in its plan to use innovative cooling technology for a new generation of stadiums in the desert</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the united states which played host in 1994 should have the edge thanks to its size its impressive array of stadiums and the added glamour of a presidential endorsement</s>
<s>in a letter to fifa barack obama waxed lyrical “as a child i played soccer on a dirt road in jakarta and the game brought the children of my neighbourhood together</s>
<s>as a father i saw that same spirit of unity alive on the fields and sidelines of my own daughters soccer games in chicago” more prosaically fifa will compare americas market size with australias and follow the money</s>
