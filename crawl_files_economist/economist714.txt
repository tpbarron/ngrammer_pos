<s>who would want to be in charge of jakarta</s>
<s>home to 10m the place is polluted floods severely every rainy season is sinking because of groundwater extraction and is the only huge southeast asian city without mass transit</s>
<s>jakarta has little green space and loses around $14 billion in output each year the government says because of its notorious traffic jams</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the other hand jakarta is indonesia’s lifeblood alone accounting for onesixth of the vast country’s gdp</s>
<s>it is the unrivalled political economic and cultural capital</s>
<s>perhaps that is why the city is in the throes of an unusually heated election campaign</s>
<s>the incumbent governor fauzi bowo is fighting for his political life against an upstart joko widodo mayor of solo in central java province</s>
<s>in july mr widodo who is 52 and known as “jokowi” won 43 of the vote in a firstround poll among six candidates mr bowo came in with just 34</s>
<s>the two men face each other in a runoff on september 20th</s>
<s>barring miracles the incumbent looks finished</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the race has turned nasty</s>
<s>mr bowo’s supporters cast ethnic and religious slurs at his challenger and his followers</s>
<s>a celebrity singer in the governor’s camp called on jakartans not to vote for an “infidel”—a clear shot at mr widodo’s running mate for vicegovernor basuki tjahja purnama who is chineseindonesian and a christian</s>
<s>indonesia is the world’s largest muslimmajority nation</s>
<s> leaflets handed out at local mosques and anonymous text messages sent to mobile phones urge much the same thing</s>
<s>on september 11th mr widodo reported mr bowo’s running mate nachrowi ramli to the local election commission for telling voters from the betawi ethnic group which is native to jakarta to pack up and leave if they did not vote for him and the governor who are betawi themselves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for all the headlines the slurs have caused they appear not to have dented mr widodo who well ahead in opinion polls has caught the imagination of ordinary jakartans</s>
<s>in solo he enjoyed a landslide reelection in july 2010 on a platform of improved business conditions and corruptionfree government</s>
<s>he is widely reckoned to be indonesia’s best mayor</s>
<s>wearing the same simple redandblue checked shirt untucked every day he appears untainted</s>
<s>against him the aloof mr bowo seems “yesterday’s man” as a jakarta newspaper had it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a widodo victory would make indonesia’s political establishment squirm</s>
<s>it backs mr bowo and the national leadership shares mr bowo’s air of privilege and drift</s>
<s>a presidential election and parliamentary polls are due in 2014 president susilo bambang yudhoyono in office since 2004 is to step down</s>
<s>not coincidentally mr widodo is being backed by the country’s main opposition parties including the gerindra party of prabowo subianto a former general and leading presidential hopeful</s>
<s>if mr widodo can clean up jakarta city hall as he has done in solo he may be called to even higher office as vicepresidential running mate</s>
<s>mr prabowo’s image abroad as a former general tainted by involvement in abuses under the suharto dictatorship could do with mr widodo’s polishing</s>
