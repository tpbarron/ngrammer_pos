<s>modern warfare involves plenty of new technology from pilotless drones to powerful computer networks and satellite sensors</s>
<s>but the explosives which are used in battle were invented a long time ago</s>
<s>the two most commonly deployed belong to a class of organic chemicals called nitramines</s>
<s>one rdx is also widely used in industrial applications like mining and demolishing buildings</s>
<s>its use as an explosive began in the 1920s</s>
<s>hmx a related compound and one of the most powerful explosives dates back to the second world war</s>
<s>both are sometimes used with trinitrotoluene a different type of compound more commonly known as tnt</s>
<s>it is over 100 years old</s>

<s>a good explosive needs to be extremely powerful but not too sensitive to avoid its being detonated accidentally such as by dropping it</s>
<s>these can be conflicting properties</s>
<s>as alex contini of the centre for defence chemistry at cranfield university in britain points out explosives developed in recent years are either too sensitive or too expensive for largescale use</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one such explosive is cl20</s>
<s>this was developed by the american navy as a rocket propellant a substance which involves the sudden release of energy by rapid oxidisation in effect a controlled explosion</s>
<s>cl20 is more powerful than rdx and hmx but its higher sensitivity means that it also explodes more easily</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the most common way to desensitise an explosive is by mixing it with a nonexplosive material such as wax or paper</s>
<s>although that works it also reduces the amount of bang you get</s>
<s>what if the desensitising material is itself an explosive of lower sensitivity</s>
<s>the problem is that the resulting material is as sensitive as its most sensitive component</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>adam matzger of the university of michigan and his colleagues have discovered a way around that problem by using a process called cocrystallisation which is commonly used by drugmakers to modify the physical properties of a pharmaceutical</s>
<s>they report in crystal growth  design that by mixing cl20 in such a way they have been able to lower its sensitivity but retain most of its explosive power</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at the heart of the process is the formation of crystals an ability endowed to some materials by nature</s>
<s>crystals are the result of molecules arranging themselves in a regular pattern extending in all three dimensions</s>
<s>sometimes two crystalline materials that do not react with each other can be mixed to form a socalled cocrystal</s>
<s>to do that they are both dissolved in a common solvent then left alone to crystallise together</s>
<s>because the arrangement of molecules within the cocrystal is very different from the original crystal it modifies the physical properties of the material—in this case cl20’s sensitivity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dr matzger made a cocrystal consisting of two parts of cl20 and one part hmx</s>
<s>the hybrid explosive has nearly the same explosive power as cl20 but the lower sensitivity of hmx</s>
<s>because the process of crystallisation can be scaled up relatively easily dr matzger whose work was funded by america’s defence threat reduction agency thinks this new explosive could make a bigger bang soon</s>
