<s>the more than 500000 smallscale coffee farmers are restive</s>
<s>last month thousands marched though manizales the capital of the coffeebelt demanding more government help and a shakeup of the federation</s>
<s>although the collapse in the harvest was partly due to unusually heavy rains over the past three years the farmers face other problems</s>
<s>as well as fungal rust a plant disease and insect infestation these include price volatility and the strength of the colombian peso which renders production unprofitable</s>

<s>some relief is at hand</s>
<s>younger diseaseresistant trees are starting to bear fruit the weather is drier this year and the central bank is intervening to drive down the peso</s>
