<s>few companies are as rooted in france as lvmh a luxurygoods group with its vintages harvested from the terroir of champagne its dresses embroidered by parisian seamstresses and its suitcases designed in the belle époque</s>
<s>so it came as a shock when the firm’s founder and chief executive bernard arnault pictured said on september 8th that he had applied for belgian nationality in order to become a dual frenchbelgian citizen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the news came as the new socialist government is preparing to implement a promise from president françois hollande’s election campaign to tax incomes of over €1m $13m at a marginal rate of 75</s>
<s>the government is attacking executive pay railing against layoffs and planning new taxes on companies</s>
<s>many french firms are fearful for the future</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to protect his group’s reputation mr arnault said he will continue to pay tax in france for the moment</s>
<s>his application he said is linked to personal investments in belgium</s>
<s>he has a close association with albert frère a belgian billionaire</s>
<s>lvmh has nothing there apart from a leather tannery</s>
<s>but few doubt that the move is meant to put pressure on the french government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in private lvmh has been one of the most vehement of french firms criticising the socialists’ tax plans</s>
<s>several of the group’s senior managers are foreigners</s>
<s>one result of the tax pledges is that local companies are already finding it hard to recruit top overseas talent</s>
<s>some nonfrench managers in paris are asking their firms to move them offshore</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in june david cameron britain’s prime minister promised to roll out a red carpet for people fleeing high french taxes</s>
<s>that the carpet may turn out to be belgian has caused no less of a fury</s>
<s>this week libération a leftleaning newspaper put mr arnault on its front page with the headline “cassetoi riche con ” which translates roughly as “sod off you rich bastard” echoing an insult that nicolas sarkozy mr hollande’s predecessor as president once directed at a member of a crowd</s>
<s>mr arnault is suing libération</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are already signs that the government is trying to lessen the impact</s>
<s>the 75 rate is likely to be imposed for two years only</s>
<s>current thinking is that those affected will not have to pay other big taxes on top so the wealthy will not as they feared end up with rates of 90 or more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that may not be enough to keep mr arnault</s>
<s>when the socialists came to power in 1981 and began a round of nationalisations he moved to the united states for three years returning only when the government reversed its policies and started privatising</s>
<s>this time at least mr arnault has picked somewhere close and partly frenchspeaking</s>
