<s>leigh fermor lived to the full a charmed life packed with incident and adventure despite its unpropitious beginnings</s>
<s>his parents returned to india shortly after his birth and only when his mother reappeared four years later did he discover that he had been living very happily in someone else’s family</s>
<s>his parents were illsuited and soon parted</s>
<s>leigh fermor was never close to his father an austere distinguished civil servant and he found his mother’s tendency to veer between possessive love and complete neglect destabilising</s>
<s>“a dangerous mixture of sophistication and recklessness” he was repeatedly expelled from school</s>

<s>he explored eastern europe fell in love with a romanian princess and lived with her in a balkan idyll until the outbreak of war</s>
<s>back in england he was commissioned in the intelligence corps and sent to the middle east</s>
<s>after escaping from a defeated greece he returned to crete to help organise the resistance and made his name with the capture and evacuation to egypt of a german general</s>

<s>the affection was mutual and 20 years later he built and settled in a house in the south of the peloponnese</s>
<s>after the war leigh fermor continued to travel widely and he used his facility with languages scholarship and extraordinary memory to good effect as an author</s>
<s>easily distracted and notoriously slow to complete a piece of writing he published fewer than a dozen works</s>

<p>
<s>it is not easy to convey the flavour of a man whose fame to a large extent rests on his ebullient personality and conversation but ms cooper succeeds admirably in this readable and entertaining book</s>
<s>nor is she shy of admitting his shortcomings and his bouts of depression when he would retreat to a trappist monastery in france</s>

<p>
<s>leigh fermor was not to everyone’s taste</s>
<s>some found him insufferably bumptious his enthusiasm and noise could be “wearing”</s>
<s>essentially though he was well loved a man of action and a selftaught intellectual who brightened the lives of his many friends and readers</s>
