<s>from the village of vijay pura in the indian state of rajasthan the global financial crisis seems remote</s>
<s>the downturn is something people here read about in the newspapers according to dhanna singh a member of the mazdoor kisan shakti sangathan mkss a union of activists and farmers</s>
<s>the villages have welcomed back migrant workers from neighbouring states where people no longer find work twisting steel in mumbai or polishing diamonds in surat</s>
<s>but by and large indias rural poor were protected from the crisis by the same things that make them poor</s>
<s>if you never had secure employment or many financial assets you cannot lose them to the crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in rajasthan this resilience is also the result of government policy</s>
<s>the national rural employment guarantee act nrega extended to every rural district in april 2008 is supposed to offer 100 days of work a year at the minimum wage to every rural household that needs it</s>

<s>in a worstcase scenario indias agricultural output could shrink by up to 7 in the fiscal year ending in march 2010 according to citigroup</s>
<s>that would drag indias gdp growth down to 52 slower than in the thick of the financial crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the drought will raise food prices adding to inflation</s>
<s>india is already the only big economy where consumer prices are rising faster now than they were before the crisis</s>

<p>
<s>indias historians often hark back to the glory days of manufacturing in the 18th century when indian artisans produced calicoes and other fabrics of such appeal that britains spinners weavers and printers clamoured successfully for import bans to protect their livelihoods</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>during britains industrial revolution however indian weavers were “thrown back on the soil”</s>
<s>indias first prime minister jawaharlal nehru wrote that indias industrial destiny had been thwarted by imperial economics</s>
<s>in 2010 thanks to a failure of the monsoon and a recovery of the world economy indias agriculture will at last give way to its manufacturing prowess</s>
