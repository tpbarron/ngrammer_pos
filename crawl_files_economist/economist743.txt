<s>it is a seductive idea</s>
<s>as newspapers struggle with declining advertising revenues and the rise of the internet a new technology arrives just in time to save them</s>
<s>ereaders hold out the prospect of allowing newspapers to shut down their expensive printing presses and switch to much cheaper electronic delivery</s>
<s>already people are prepared to pay to receive newspapers and magazines including the economist on the kindle even though they seem reluctant to pay for news on the web</s>
<s>an ereader can be taken anywhere after all and provides a better reading experience than a web browser</s>
<s>might ereaders provide a new model for newspapers in the digital age</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>perhaps they will one day but it will not be any time soon</s>
<s>for one thing ereaders are not yet a mature technology and are still too expensive</s>
<s>in theory a newspaper could ask its readers to sign up for a twoyear electronic subscription say and subsidise the cost of an ereader</s>
<s>several newspapers are said to be considering this model</s>
<s>but newspapers would still have to keep their pricey presses running to serve readers who choose not to go electronic and subsidising the switch to ereaders would require huge upfront investment</s>
<s>given most newspapers parlous finances this seems implausible</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a further problem is that even if the technology were ready today most newspapers would have trouble switching because their oldfashioned technology and processes would stand in the way</s>
<s>firstpaper a secretive startup backed by hearst a media group hopes to address this problem by providing all the technological components from backend software to ereader devices that newspapers need to go electronic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it seems most likely however that people will buy ereaders or more generalpurpose devices such as tablet computers to read ebooks primarily and will then also use them to read enewspapers</s>
<s>getting the news on an ereader will probably become commonplace eventually but it will not happen soon enough to rescue americas troubled newspapers</s>
<s>expect more of them to fold in 2010 ereaders or no</s>
