<s>it is a calm before the storm</s>
<s>as mariano rajoy the prime minister waits for regional elections in galicia and the basque country on october 21st spain is inching towards asking for a “soft” bailout</s>
<s>but officials insist no formal request is imminent</s>
<s>markets are calm but watchful</s>
<s>although standard  poor’s a rating agency has downgraded spain to close to junk yields on tenyear debt have fallen to a sixmonth low of under 55</s>
<s>some say a request for help that unleashes unlimited bondbuying by the european central bank ecb would cut another 15 percentage points making spain’s borrowing costs manageable</s>
<s>indeed they could fall so low that the bailout credit line became redundant and the ecb would not even need to buy bonds officials talk of a “virtual” rescue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so why not put in a request now</s>
<s>one answer is nervousness about a possible germanled “no”</s>
<s>that officials say would destroy the euro overnight better to wait for a green light from berlin</s>
<s>but spanish footdragging cannot all be blamed on northern europeans</s>
<s>the thorniest problems are the deficits and bailout terms</s>
<s>last year’s deficit was 89 of gdp way above the 6 target</s>
<s>this year’s target is 63 and next year’s is 45 requiring more cuts in the teeth of recession</s>
<s>yet unemployment is already 25</s>
<s>fierce austerity has provoked the first signs of social unrest and is fuelling nationalism in catalonia where an election on november 25th could produce a separatist landslide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>deficit hawks in germany finland and elsewhere will insist on spain meeting its targets</s>
<s>but it is sure to miss this year’s</s>
<s>and officials admit that the 2013 budget is based on an optimistic assumption of a 05 fall in gdp</s>
<s>the imf more realistically predicts gdp shrinkage of 13 in 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if spain’s deficit ends up even close to this year’s target madrid will claim to have produced a near miracle</s>
<s>cutting a deficit that much during such a deep recession would be a rare achievement among big oecd countries says a senior official</s>
<s>but although the tax take is on target the socialsecurity system regional governments and a tax amnesty are all going off course</s>
<s>in middecember mr rajoy must decide whether to indexlink pensions adding some €25 billion $33 billion a year to spending</s>
<s>the deficit was running at an annual rate of 84 of gdp in the second quarter and spanish deficits normally widen over the second half of the year according to a study by michele boldrin and j ignacio conderuiz of the fedea thinktank</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover the tide of opinion against excessive fiscal tightening is turning</s>
<s>the imf now says that the fiscal multiplier measuring the impact of deficit cuts on gdp is higher than it previously thought</s>
<s>that explains why spain is happy to see the imf involved in setting conditions for an as yet untried ecbbacked soft bailout</s>
<s>madrid holds up portugal as an example of how rescue programmes can fail by being too harsh see article</s>
<s>it thinks structural reforms to which it claims to be firmly committed matter more than the deficit</s>
<s>officials believe the message is getting through to brussels and frankfurt</s>
<s>spain’s own 2012 deficit target has shifted from 44 to 63 in the past 18 months</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>spaniards do not like the idea of being bossed about by outsiders which explains why mr rajoy is keen to wait until after the galician and basque elections</s>
<s>there are other advantages to delay</s>
<s>the longer spain waits the more the imf’s view may win support bringing softer terms</s>
<s>but there are dangers too</s>
<s>yields have come down from 7 mainly because markets expect a bailout</s>
<s>they may tire of delay—and mr rajoy may find he is asking for help at a time of panic not calm</s>
