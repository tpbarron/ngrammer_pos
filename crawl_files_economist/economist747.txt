<s>greece’s fragile coalition government only narrowly averted disaster on november 7th when it won parliamentary approval for a drastic new austerity package</s>
<s>the package scraped through with 153 votes to 128 in the 300member house</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>antonis samaras the prime minister made the best of it saying that “greece has turned a page” meanwhile furious antiausterity protesters outside parliament hurled stones and molotov cocktails at police in what has become a grim ritual</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the debate over the latest austerity measures the toughest yet had turned angry even before lawmakers studied the 500page “polylaw” before them</s>
<s>presenting the fouryear programme to parliament’s economics committee yannis stournaras the finance minister fended off attacks from syriza the leftist opposition party pointing out that if it were voted down greece would lose a desperately needed €315 billion $40 billion slice of its bailout funding would default on its next debt repayment and would surely then make a disorderly exit from the euro</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr stournaras had gradually given ground over four months of negotiations with the “troika” of the european union the european central bank and the imf on the package to be implemented in 2013 and 2014</s>
<s>greek proposals for cuts in government operating costs were rejected as unrealistic</s>
<s>so they were replaced by “permanent” spending reductions code for slashing salaries and pensions</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many elderly greeks’ worst fears were realised when the law was unveiled</s>
<s>the biggest chunk of savings next year about €46 billion comes from reducing pensions starting with a 5 cut for those on a modest €1000 a month</s>
<s>“it feels as if the troika has selected the old for special punishment” commented constantina athanassakis a 70yearold retired hairdresser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>salaries of betterpaid publicsector workers such as centralbank employees university teachers judges and hospital doctors will also be cut</s>
<s>salaries at publicsector corporations are being reduced by 35 and capped at €5000 a month which means takehome pay of just €2900 for bosses and fewer perks</s>
<s>some cuts will be backdated</s>
<s>next year’s budget assumes the economy will shrink by another 45 but local economists predict that a collapse in spending by cashstrapped consumers could lead to an even bigger fall</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>antonis samaras the centreright prime minister promises this will be the “last and final” round of cuts</s>
<s>but greece’s creditors are not so sure given the poor record of all greek governments on reform</s>
<s>the economy is not expected to start growing again before 2015</s>
<s>few observers expect the government to keep to its new timetable of cutting 110000 civilservice jobs by 2016</s>
<s>the privatisation programme has been disappointing</s>
<s>with greece looking politically unstable and facing two more years of recession it will be hard to attract foreign investors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it does not help that mr samaras’s threeparty coalition is increasingly fragile</s>
<s>his centreright new democracy party is expected to stay loyal at the next parliamentary test approving the 2013 budget this weekend</s>
<s>fotis kouvelis leader of the small democratic left has also pledged to back the government</s>
<s>but his decision to abstain from the vote on november 7th has undermined his credibility with mr samaras</s>
<s>mr kouvelis could soon face a leadership challenge</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many observers also believe that evangelos venizelos leader of the panhellenic socialist movement pasok may be unseated</s>
<s>mr venizelos’s reluctance when serving as finance minister to investigate the socalled lagarde list of 2000 greeks with bank accounts in geneva has annoyed many in his party</s>
<s>several former ministers think they could do a better job of rebuilding pasok’s popularity which is at an alltime low of around 6 according to the polls</s>
<s>yet if pasok fragments the government risks losing its majority—and the prospect of a grexit will loom yet again</s>
