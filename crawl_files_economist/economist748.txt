<s>engines on airliners are highly efficient when they are in flight but not when operating on the ground</s>
<s>when a plane is taxiing under its own power the engines burn vast amounts of fuel</s>
<s>a boeing 747 can consume a tonne of fuel and emit several tonnes of carbon dioxide during an average 17minute taxi to takeoff</s>
<s>and when the aircraft lands there is likely to be another long drive to the passenger gate</s>
<s>which is why there are various methods being developed for aircraft to use other means of propulsion while moving around an airport</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>towing aircraft with a tug similar to how they are pushed back from the gate is one way</s>
<s>but constantly pulling on the front landing gear can lead to mechanical problems</s>
<s>many pilots would also prefer to be in control of the driving once their aircraft is on the taxiway</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one method that addresses both concerns is a semirobotic tug called taxibot developed by israel aerospace industries iai</s>
<s>instead of using a tow bar attached to the aircraft’s nose wheel taxibot employs a mechanism which automatically scoops the wheel up into a rotating turret</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the taxibot also avoids having any complicated links to connect to the cockpit yet still gives the pilots driving control</s>
<s>it does this by accelerating to the speed set for the taxiway using its inbuilt gps map system</s>
<s>the pilots then use their usual controls to steer with the nose wheel which in turn steers the taxibot and to brake with the main landing gear</s>
<s>a safety driver remains in the taxibot and he also drives the vehicle to and from the aircraft</s>

<p>
<s>with the high price of aviation fuel—a tonne can cost more than $1000—the savings at a busy airport could be large</s>
<s>at some airports the passenger gates can be several miles from the runway</s>
<s>all told the world’s airlines spend $7 billion8 billion a year taxiing between passenger gates and the runway says yehoshua eldar who is in charge of business development at iai</s>
<s>the taxibot though uses just 2030 litres of fuel for a typical trip</s>
<s>it also reduces the risk of debris being ingested by the engines and causing damage</s>
<s>germany’s lufthansa will trial the system at frankfurt airport from may 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the future some airliners may be driven to and from the runway with electric power</s>
<s>the german aerospace centre has tested this idea in an aircraft using a fuel cell to power two electric motors built into the hub of an aircraft nose wheel</s>
<s>the centre reckons that up to 19 of current airport emissions could be saved using such a system</s>
<s>and it would also please the neighbours there would be hardly any noise during taxiing</s>
