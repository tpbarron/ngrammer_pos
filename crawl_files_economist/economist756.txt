<s>what would you say about a market that has helped reduce carbon emissions by a billion tonnes in seven years attracted $215 billion of green investments to developing countries more than any private environmental fund and cut the cost of climatechange mitigation by $36 billion</s>
<s>the answer to judge by a united nations panel looking into the workings of the clean development mechanism cdm is you’d say it is a shambles</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the cdm was set up under the kyoto protocol to get developing countries to do their bit to reduce carbon emissions</s>
<s>the mechanism allows projects that reduce greenhousegas emissions in poor countries to earn a carbon credit a “certified emission reduction” or cer for each tonne of carbon dioxide avoided</s>
<s>the credits can be sold to firms in rich countries which are obliged under kyoto to cut their emissions</s>
<s>the idea was to encourage carbon saving where it was cheapest ie in developing countries increasing efficiency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the trouble is that the supply of credits has far outstripped demand</s>
<s>the onebillionth cer was issued on september 7th</s>
<s>but the largest greenhousegas emitters either did not ratify the kyoto protocol america or were not obliged by it to cut emissions china and india</s>
<s>that has left europe as the main source of demand for credits and the cdm has become a sort of annex to europe’s capandtrade scheme the emissions trading system</s>
<s>but the euro crisis has reduced industrial activity cutting pollution and european firms were anyway given overly generous carbon quotas under the capandtrade scheme</s>
<s>so carbon prices have collapsed falling from $20 a tonne in august 2008 to below $5 now see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>an oversupply of permits to pollute is an endemic problem</s>
<s>a recent report by thomson reuters point carbon an information provider found that supplies of a different emissions right under the kyoto protocol called an “assigned amount unit” outstripped estimated demand by over a thousand times</s>
<s>excess supply is not the only problem the cdm faces though the un panel also calls for a clearer separation between the executive board and the operational secretariat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>joan macnaughton the vicechair of the panel says there is a strong case for having something that links the many regional and national carbon markets that are cropping up including in australia new zealand china and from next year california</s>
<s>but for the cdm to provide that link countries will have to reduce their greenhousegas emission targets drastically thus providing a boost to demand</s>
<s>at the moment there is little sign of that happening</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>correction the chart in the print edition of this article includes a righthand scale that is incorrectly scaled in millions—rather than billions—of credits issued</s>
