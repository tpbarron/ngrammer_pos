<s>it is a rite of passage for every new french president to head to frenchspeaking africa and reaffirm faith in la francophonie</s>
<s>so it was with françois hollande who has just visited senegal and the democratic republic of congo</s>
<s>like his predecessor nicolas sarkozy he said “françafrique”—the cosy postcolonial ties of party financing arms contracts and influence—was over and that human rights were paramount</s>
<s>he praised the shared use of french “language of liberty”</s>
<s>but behind the warm words lie grimmer concerns the biggest being the entrenchment of terror networks in the alqaedaheld sahel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>islamist fighters tied to alqaeda in the islamic maghreb aqim have ruled a big swathe of northern mali since march dividing the country in two</s>
<s>in the far north extreme s haria law is being applied</s>
<s>mr hollande spoke in senegal of “a reign of terror” in mali with “hands cut off women raped and an area awash with weapons”</s>
<s>there are also two french hostages in mali whose families the president has just met in paris as well as four in niger</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>despite france’s reluctance to play postcolonial gendarme mr hollande is starting to sound tougher on mali</s>
<s>during his african trip he tried to rally regional leaders to the cause</s>
<s>manuel valls the interior minister visited algeria to narrow differences</s>
<s>france drafted a un security council resolution unanimously adopted on october 12th that authorises the dispatch of an african force to retake rebelheld territory in mali</s>
<s>jeanyves le drian the french defence minister says such a force could be ready “within weeks”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet his enthusiasm may be overdone</s>
<s>the plan is that a force would be made up of troops from mali and other countries in the economic community of west african states ecowas</s>
<s>but even if willing ones can be lined up regional forces do not have the capacity to mount an offensive operation without logistical and intelligence support</s>
<s>the french are ready to contribute but have ruled out sending in ground troops</s>
<s>although the european union says it will send trainers under an eu flag the americans are reluctant to get involved</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>france’s anxiety is that if nothing is done the sahel might become a crucible for islamist terrorism</s>
<s>“what makes people very nervous is the idea that it will become africa’s afghanistan” says françois heisbourg of the foundation for strategic research a thinktank</s>
<s>france with its colonial history and commercial ties is an obvious target</s>
<s>one malian islamist group has explicitly threatened mr hollande since his push for military action and said that french hostages are in greater danger</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as it is france is already fretting about terrorist threats</s>
<s>although there is no direct link to aqim french police dismantled an islamist cell in france earlier this month arresting 12 suspects and shooting one dead</s>
<s>two were wanted in connection with an attack on a kosher grocer in a paris suburb last month which rattled france’s big jewish population</s>
<s>seven have been charged with terrorist offences</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>françois molins the paris public prosecutor called the cell “extremely dangerous”</s>
<s>some suspects were french converts to islam</s>
<s>the threat is “increasingly coming from within” mr valls told the senate adding that radicalisation can take a matter of months</s>
<s>the country was shocked earlier this year when seven people including three jewish children and a rabbi were shot dead in toulouse by a french islamist who claimed to have been trained by alqaeda</s>
<s>the surveillance of radicals has been stepped up</s>
<s>mr valls is putting a law before parliament to give the police new powers to pursue french nationals abroad suspected of links to terrorism or of attending foreign training camps</s>
<s>with or without a frenchbacked operation in mali france is on high alert</s>
