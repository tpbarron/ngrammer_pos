<s>italians in their millions are abstaining from democracy</s>
<s>the turnout in last month’s sicilian regional election was below 50</s>
<s>and those who do vote are looking in evergrowing numbers to protest groups in sicily one founded by a comedian and blogger beppe grillo came top</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to understand why consider lombardy the region of italy’s financial capital milan</s>
<s>the city was once italy’s “moral capital” too—before the premierships of bettino craxi who died an exiled fugitive from justice and of silvio berlusconi another native milanese</s>
<s>but the sober and conscientious mario monti italy’s current prime minister is from lombardy</s>
<s>and the region’s people still see themselves as more industrious and upright than southerners</s>
<s>the northern league stresses lombardy’s supposedly celtic heritage</s>
<s>others point to links with the teutonic world including a stint under the austrian empire</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet since its regional election in 2010 lombardy’s politics has seen a moral collapse</s>
<s>the last straw was the arrest of the head of housing domenico zambetti accused of aiding the calabrian mafia or ’ndrangheta see article</s>
<s>soon afterwards roberto formigoni who has governed lombardy for 17 years dissolved its 80seat assembly</s>
<s>an election is likely in january</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr zambetti brought to 14 the number of regional lawmakers under investigation or arrest on trial or in jail</s>
<s>all but one are members of silvio berlusconi’s people of freedom pdl movement or of the northern league its coalition partner in lombardy</s>
<s>alleged offences include taking bribes illegal party donations fraud embezzlement fraudulent bankruptcy and incitement to violence</s>
<s>nicole minetti a former television showgirl and dental hygienist allegedly supplied women for mr berlusconi’s “bunga bunga” parties aiding and abetting prostitution</s>
<s>more regional parliamentarians are in trouble with the law in lombardy than in campania the region around naples</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what makes this striking is that since 1995 politics in lombardy has been under the sway of a catholic spiritual movement called communion and liberation cl</s>
<s>mr formigoni who is himself under investigation is a leading member of cl a group that grew up in reaction to the student uprisings of 1968</s>
<s>its ventures include an annual meeting in rimini at which speakers have included nobel laureates and mother teresa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr formigoni belongs to the memores domini an association of cl members who are meant to live by the values of fraternal love obedience and poverty</s>
<s>among the accusations levelled at him is that he accepted from a friend and businessman holidays at a luxurious caribbean resort popular with hollywood stars</s>
<s>mr formigoni denies this claiming to have paid for the holidays himself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the chief function of italian regional government is to provide health care</s>
<s>piero bassetti who was lombardy’s first governor in 1970 says that successive formigoni administrations created one of the best health services in europe</s>
<s>but he also claims that cl affiliates in government became “a mafia in the loosest sense” and “opened the doors to corruption”</s>
<s>critics say lucrative contracts were steered to members of an association of businesspeople linked to cl</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fabio pizzul a possible centreleft candidate for the governorship of lombardy says the cl’s influence remains considerable and the extent of its future clout remains “an open question”</s>
<s>as for mr formigoni he may be finished as governor</s>
<s>but he has talked of standing in next month’s primary to choose the pdl candidate for prime minister at next spring’s general election</s>
