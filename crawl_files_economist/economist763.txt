<s>for the first time in its history nasa has decided to turn over the transport of spacestation cargo to the commercial sector</s>
<s>in december 2008 following a competition between spacex orbital sciences and a joint venture of boeing lockheed and atk nasa awarded 12 “space freighter” missions to my company spacex and eight to orbital</s>
<s>you will see the first spacex demonstration flights a prelude to operational missions in 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is no realistic alternative to private enterprise advancing the cause of space if you believe it is important for life as we know it to become multiplanetary</s>
<s>only the private sector is capable of improving the cost and reliability of space transport to the degree necessary to establish selfsustaining life on mars</s>
<s>at current publicsector costs and reliability even if the world already possessed rockets and spacecraft that could take humans to mars we would bankrupt the global economy and suffer loss of life that is intolerable in the modern era</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some may be surprised to hear me assert that the commercial sector would improve reliability so dramatically thinking perhaps that companies would make unsafe decisions to achieve low cost</s>
<s>not at all—it is very unprofitable to kill customers</s>
<s>the airline and car industries are almost entirely private and both have incredibly impressive safety records</s>
<s>in fact you may be surprised to learn that your probable lifespan would actually be higher if you lived every minute of it on a commercial airliner</s>

<p>
<s>historically transporting cargo to and from the international space station has been done primarily by the space shuttle but it is due to retire in late 2010 or in early 2011 if a short extension is granted</s>
<s>nasa is working on a new rocket system derived from the space shuttle but that will be ready only in 2017</s>
<s>moreover the cost of using it to service the space station would require a dramatic and improbable increase in nasas budget</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is worth noting that cargo transport to the station is the shuttles main duty</s>
<s>in effect therefore nasa has decided that the successor to the space shuttle will be commercial rockets and spacecraft</s>
<s>the significance of this decision has yet to permeate the public consciousness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>id like to be clear here that nasa played a critical role in fostering development of the commercial systems by providing much of the funding as well as expert guidance</s>
<s>a great deal of credit is therefore due to the foresight and hard work of people at nasa</s>
<s>that said the space agency should not be blamed for any missteps along the way of the sort that almost always happen with new rocket developments</s>
<s>the design is that of spacex and we—particularly i as chief designer—should rightfully take responsibility for errors</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whatever bumps along the trajectory there may be i am confident that nasas support for commercial companies will prove to be critical to humanitys future in space</s>
<s>it is not simply an option it is the only option</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>flight of the astronaut</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although the course for cargo is set the white house has not yet decided to have the commercial sector transport astronauts</s>
<s>however it augurs well that a panel of industry luminaries recently convened by the white house and led by norman augustine a former ceo of lockheed has come down firmly for it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is up to barack obama to make a final decision based on the options presented by the panel but none of the options considered viable includes the default path the shuttlederived ares i rocket and orion spacecraft to service the space station</s>
<s>the panel pointed out quite reasonably that the nasa budget allows for either ares iorion or the space station but not both</s>
<s>however since ares i is capable only of reaching low earth orbit and the space station is the only habitable thing in low earth orbit ares i by itself would be a road to nowhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moreover the panel said that ares iorion would be ready to fly to the space station only in 2017 six years after the space shuttle retires</s>
<s>that would mean a long solesource dependency on russias soyuz for which nasa is already paying $50m per seat</s>
<s>whatever price is charged after the shuttle retires will depend on the kindness of the russian government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in contrast spacex will be ready to transport astronauts within three years of receiving a nasa contract at a price per seat of $20m</s>
<s>we are not alone</s>
<s>united launch alliance ula a joint venture between boeing and lockheed has publicly promised to be ready in four years</s>
<s>orbital sciences is also confident of getting the job done in a similar timeframe</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nasa will pick probably two or three companies for this task in 2010 heralding the dawn of a new era in human spaceflight</s>
