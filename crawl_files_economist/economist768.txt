<s>by its recent chaotic standards pakistan had quite a good 2009</s>
<s>admittedly more than 2m people were displaced by fighting between the army and taliban militants</s>
<s>the economy was in the doldrums</s>
<s>and a threat of political crisis pitting president asif zardari against his main rival nawaz sharif loomed</s>
<s>yet his government a coalition led by the pakistan peoples party ppp looked stable</s>
<s>an injection of imf cash—and a promise from america of an extra $15 billion a year—kept its creditors at bay</s>
<s>and the army despite much suffering won the biggest victories of a floundering eightyear campaign on its northwest frontier</s>
<s>without catastrophic violence—an important assassination or a terrorist attack in india—pakistan will be messy but stable after this fashion in 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the army will also make a bit more progress against the militants</s>
<s>goaded into action in early 2009 after the taliban seized areas of northwest frontier province alarmingly close to islamabad it pushed them back ruthlessly</s>
<s>compounding the talibans troubles their supreme leader baitullah mehsud who was responsible for a twoyear suicidebomb spree and allegedly for the 2007 murder of mr zardaris wife benazir bhutto was killed by an american missile last august</s>
<s>and in october the army launched an assault on his former fief in south waziristan</s>
<s>alas it has shown no interest in pursuing members of the other taliban afghanistans former rulers who have found refuge in pakistan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>americas effort in 2009 to redefine afghanistan and pakistan as a single theatre “afpak” was partly to deal with this</s>
<s>the strategy recognised that neither country can be stable while the other is not—and that an unstable pakistan with over 180m people nuclear bombs and a history of war with india is of particular concern</s>
<s>that was sensible</s>
<s>so was a big increase in american aid to the country</s>
<s>but this will be insufficient in 2010 and beyond to change the armys view of the afghan taliban as a valuable hedge against the wests likely defeat in afghanistan—and indias growing influence there</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in late 2009 mr zardari denounced the afpak conceit saying pakistan could not be compared with its wild neighbour</s>
<s>that is the view of the army and a sign that mr zardari feels increasingly beholden to it</s>
<s>he has learned the hard way having several times been rebuked by the generals for challenging nationalsecurity shibboleths for example by accepting the many sternly phrased conditions on fighting terrorism and stopping nuclear proliferation that the american congress attached to its new aid package in october 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed mr zardari who inherited the ppp from his wife and vast powers from his predecessor pervez musharraf had a painful 2009</s>
<s>he was forced by mass protests to reinstate as chief justice an ally of mr sharif iftikhar chaudhry who had been sacked by mr musharraf</s>
<s>this led to the courts cleansing mr sharif of a criminal record earned under mr musharraf so rendering him eligible to reenter parliament</s>
<s>emboldened he and his pakistan muslim league nawaz party will push hard in 2010 to peg back mr zardaris powers and make mr sharif eligible for a third term as prime minister</s>
<s>the army though no friend to mr sharif may support them</s>
<s>this is another risk to pakistans nervewracking stability but perhaps the easiest to contain</s>
<s>rather than face more protests mr zardari would probably concede their demands</s>
<s>even so the pppled coalition government will survive 2010 chiefly because its junior partners are wary of mr sharif</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some threats are worse than others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>of all the threats another terrorist strike in india would be the most dangerous</s>
<s>indias government a coalition led by the congress party showed admirable restraint after a big attack by pakistani terrorists in mumbai in 2008</s>
<s>so it was reassuring that congress and its pacific prime minister manmohan singh retained power at an election in may 2009</s>
<s>indeed mr singh swiftly tried to muster support for restoring a peace process between the two rivals—and there is an even chance this will happen in 2010</s>
<s>but it would not restart at its former hopeful point</s>
<s>and in the event of another mumbai india may feel that refreezing a diplomatic initiative would be an inadequate expression of its rage</s>
