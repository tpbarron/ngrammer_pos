<s>for investors around the world the recovery seems assured</s>
<s>the msci global share index has risen almost 10 since july</s>
<s>the credit for this largely goes to central bankers</s>
<s>in july mario draghi president of the european central bank ecb said he would do whatever it takes to hold the euro together</s>
<s>in early september the ecb pledged to be a lender of last resort to governments albeit under certain conditions</s>
<s>soon afterwards the federal reserve launched a new round of quantitative easing printing money to buy bonds and promised to keep buying assets until american unemployment was “substantially” less awful</s>
<s>other central banks followed with loosening of their own in part to stop their currencies from rising see article</s>
<s>all this activism boosted share prices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but is it justified</s>
<s>the surge in shares certainly looks odd in light of the recent economic statistics</s>
<s>over the past few months global growth has slowed to its weakest pace since the 2009 recession as the world’s big economies have lost steam simultaneously</s>
<s>american output is growing at less than 2</s>
<s>growth in china which until recently was in double digits appears to have slowed to around 7</s>
<s>japan’s economy almost certainly shrank in the third quarter</s>
<s>and the euro zone’s recession shows no sign of easing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>financial markets of course are forwardlooking</s>
<s>investors are betting that sustained monetary loosening will perk up the world economy</s>
<s>mr draghi and his peers are certainly doing their bit</s>
<s>however investors’ optimism ignores the fact that many politicians are being shockingly irresponsible</s>
<s>in different ways politicians’ actions or inaction are the biggest shortterm danger facing the american european and chinese economies</s>
<s>judging by politicians’ current behaviour the world economy could slow a lot further</s>
<s>it could even tip into recession in 2013</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dithering bickering and backtracking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the danger is most imminent and obvious in america thanks to the socalled “fiscal cliff”</s>
<s>under current law america is set for a fiscal squeeze worth roughly 5 of gdp as the bush tax cuts and a host of more recent temporary tax reductions expire at the end of this year and deep cuts to defence and other types of federal spending kick in</s>
<s>if politicians do nothing that fiscal squeeze would eventually send the weak economy back into recession</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that prospect is so horrible that most people assume the politicians will act either just before the end of this year or early next</s>
<s>but no one knows what exactly they will do or when</s>
<s>nothing will happen until after the election on november 6th</s>
<s>and congress is barely in session between then and the end of the year</s>
<s>the atmosphere of economic uncertainty is paralysing american business see article</s>
<s>investors are more relaxed but their nonchalance may prove misplaced</s>
<s>any plausible solution requires compromise between republicans and democrats in washington dc</s>
<s>neither tribe seems in the mood for it</s>
<s>ironically the fed’s boldness may have left lawmakers less worried about acting responsibly themselves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>something similar is happening in europe where politicians seem to have interpreted the ecb’s actions as a licence to twiddle their thumbs</s>
<s>spain is dithering about applying for a rescue package</s>
<s>germany and other creditor countries are going back on their promises to use joint rescue funds to recapitalise banks</s>
<s>the germans are obstructing the move towards common bank supervision</s>
<s>if this backtracking continues the relief in the peripheries’ bond yields could prove shortlived and the euro zone’s recession will deepen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in china economic reform has stalled</s>
<s>to be fair china’s politicians were wise to eschew a 2008style credit binge to arrest this year’s slowdown</s>
<s>they have little appetite for another investment splurge</s>
<s>but they have failed to do enough to accelerate the shift from an exportled economy to one that relies on domestic consumption</s>
<s>they should be breaking up domestic monopolies and radically reforming the tax code see article</s>
<s>instead the ruling communist party is utterly consumed with internal matters such as who gets which job when its new leaders take over</s>
<s>as a result china’s slowdown could be longer and more painful than necessary</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>not all politicians are behaving irresponsibly</s>
<s>mexico seems close to a big labourmarket overhaul</s>
<s>brazil has combined a vigorous stimulus with steps towards trimming its growththrottling payroll taxes</s>
<s>india’s government is at last stirring itself to action</s>
<s>but in the world’s big three economies politicians are either dithering or doing damage</s>
<s>central bankers alone cannot save the world economy</s>
<s>it is time for politicians to pitch in</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>correction an earlier version of this article stated that the msci global share index has risen around 6 since july</s>
<s>the correct figure is about 10</s>
<s>sorry</s>
