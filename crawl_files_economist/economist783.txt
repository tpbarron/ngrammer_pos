<s>in most industries the loss of a few thousand jobs usually prompts a rash of sympathetic newspaper articles</s>
<s>if the jobs are in manufacturing politicians will compete in offering proposals to revive them</s>
<s>when thousands of jobs are lost in investment banks however there is barely disguised glee</s>
<s>instead of offering soothing words and subsidies politicians promise to crack down even harder on banks and regulators draft new rules to hobble them further or tax them more</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>much of the opprobrium is focused on “casino” investment banking</s>
<s>the list of measures to curb the gambling is already long</s>
<s>in britain banks will have to “ringfence” their retailbanking businesses to protect them from the failure of their investment banks</s>
<s>in america the volcker rule aims to stop banks trading for their own profit</s>
<s>more restrictions are coming</s>
<s>in europe a committee of experts weighing the merits of either a ringfence or a volcker rule seems likely to suggest that brussels should adopt both in addition to rules limiting bonuses</s>
<s>european officials are pressing for a tax on financial transactions that could cost many more jobs on banks’ trading desks</s>
<s>efforts to shift much more derivatives trading on to exchanges will also eat into investmentbanking margins</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the house loses</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with so many rules still in the works you could be forgiven for thinking that the casino was packed with gamblers and still in urgent need of regulation</s>
<s>on the contrary the industry that politicians and voters wish to humble has already been brought to its knees by a downturn in financial markets and by changes to the rules on capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the full effects of these changes are yet to be felt but some consequences are already clear see article</s>
<s>nomura a japanese bank that pounced on the european and asian arms of lehman brothers is licking its wounds and retreating from its ambitions to build a global investmentbanking powerhouse</s>
<s>deutsche bank long reliant on its investment bank to boost profits now hopes for utilitylike returns on equity of just 12 compared with the 20 it used to earn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the retreat also has a human cost</s>
<s>the financial industry in london the world’s most international banking hub will probably have shed 100000 jobs by the end of this year from its peak of 354000 in 2007</s>
<s>in new york the industry employs 20000 fewer people than it did before the crisis and it is likely to lose 2600 more jobs this year</s>
<s>pay is also falling fast—down by about 30 since 2007—and it comes with new strings</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some of the industry’s shrinkage is overdue</s>
<s>bank profits soared in the years before the crisis as western economies binged on cheap credit</s>
<s>that bubble has now burst</s>
<s>rules on capital and liquidity known as basel 3 are already crushing returns and that in turn is bearing down on both pay and employment</s>
<s>again this is broadly a good thing</s>
<s>weak capital standards before the crisis encouraged banks to borrow too much and led investment banks in particular to hold more trading assets than was good for them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet there is also a danger of regulating too fiercely</s>
<s>rules on securitisation on both sides of the atlantic for instance are making it harder for banks to shed risk and free up their balancesheets to keep making new loans</s>
<s>by unlocking the capital markets and helping firms to manage risks investment banks are important conduits of credit to economies beset by slow growth and government retrenchment</s>
<s>as more scandals emerge—as they surely will not least as a result of investigations into the rigging of the libor interest rate—politicians and regulators will be tempted to pile on yet more rules</s>
<s>they should be careful</s>
<s>the industry is already changing</s>
