<s>businesses avidly mine data to improve their efficiency</s>
<s>nonprofit groups have plenty of information too</s>
<s>but they can rarely afford to hire numbercrunchers</s>
<s>now a bunch of philanthropic geeks at datakind a new yorkbased charity are helping other dogooders work more productively and quantify their achievements for donors who like to see that their money is well spent</s>

<p>
<s>a typical datakind twoday “hackathon” last month in london attracted 50 people who worked in three teams</s>
<s>one pored over the records of place2be which offers counselling to troubled schoolchildren</s>
<s>crunching the data showed that boys tend to respond better than girls though girls who lived with only their fathers showed the biggest improvements of all</s>
<s>the charity did not know that</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the expertise is far beyond what is available to a typical charity</s>
<s>the smalltalk among the volunteers was of dizzyingly complex statistical and artificialintelligence techniques</s>
<s>volunteers included an analyst at teradata a dataanalytics firm</s>
<s>around 20 employees attended from aimia a firm that mines data from consumerloyalty programs</s>

<s>in a previous hackathon in san francisco datakind volunteers analysed the data from mobilising health a nonprofit group that connects rural patients in india with doctors in cities that are usually many hours away</s>
<s>volunteers record symptoms and relay them by cellphones</s>
<s>the doctors then may prescribe drugs or recommend a hospital visit</s>
<s>the charity wanted to use the many months’ worth of accumulated text messages to evaluate the medics’ performance</s>
<s>thanks to datakind the charity was able to rejig the system to take more account of urgency and to direct requests to the most responsive doctors</s>

<s>thomas levine a data scientist at scraperwiki a provider of dataprocessing services says he has attended datakind events out of altruism but also for education</s>
<s>would anyone care to measure that benefit</s>
