<s>to shop or not to shop on sundays</s>
<s>the question is divisive</s>
<s>margaret thatcher’s efforts to let shops stay open as long as they like was shot down in a rare defeat</s>
<s>her successor john major placated angry christians and trade unions with a compromise small shops could set their own hours but large ones could only open for six hours between 10am and 6pm</s>
<s>that has stuck</s>
<s>yet freemarketminded politicians continue to wonder whether longer store hours might help stimulate the economy</s>
<s>so to coincide with the expected surge of olympic visitors over the summer the government experimented with relaxed sunday trading laws for eight weeks</s>
<s>the trial which ended on september 9th failed to boost spending</s>
<s>but it did reveal what shoppers want</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>august saw the “worst sales growth this year” according to a report from the british retail consortium brc a retail analyst</s>
<s>likeforlike sales were down 04 from last year</s>
<s>admittedly the olympics appear to have suppressed spending generally apart from on televisions during the first week of the games</s>
<s>online sales grew at their slowest rate since the brc began collecting data in 2008 for example</s>
<s>parts of west london were almost deserted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the brief relaxation of sunday trading restrictions appears to have encouraged shoppers to move from small shops to bigger ones</s>
<s>paul cheema who runs a costcutter convenience store in coventry reports that sunday sales slipped by up to 7 during the summer</s>
<s>he hopes they will bounce back this weekend now that the trial is over</s>
<s>other convenience stores have reported a loss in sunday trade of up to 20 this summer with up to 30 less foot traffic says shane brennan at the association of convenience stores</s>
<s>“the law wasn’t broken” says donal horgan managing director of londis a franchise of small stores which also saw a decline in sunday sales</s>
<s>“now it should go back”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>consumers are keen to while away their sundays in superstores in theory as well as in practice</s>
<s>a yougov survey commissioned by dwf a business law firm found that 45 of people believe shops should choose when to open</s>
<s>but few supermarkets are lobbying for a permanent change in the regulations not least because they now have thousands of smaller outposts around the country</s>
<s>the politicians are unlikely to come away from this experiment motivated to tinker with the law</s>
<s>sunday’s distorted market appears safe for now</s>
