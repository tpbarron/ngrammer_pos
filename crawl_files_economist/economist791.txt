<s>already in 2009 the seattle postintelligencer and denvers rocky mountain news among other historic names couldnt find buyers and simply stopped printing</s>
<s>the new york times which paid $11 billion for the boston globe in 1993 spent most of the past year hungrily eyeing bids of under $100m</s>

<s>after years of micawberism many newspaper publishers now accept that no amount of costcutting and laying off of journalists can keep up with plummeting revenues</s>

<s>and yet a revival of hopes that the odd penny might yet be squeezed from loyal readers is under way</s>
<s>barely two years after abandoning the experiment of putting their most popular columnists behind a pay wall executives of the new york times have talked openly of trying again some different way perhaps “metering” how long people spend on the site and charging a fee to those who stay beyond their free welcome</s>
<s>or perhaps some version of a “membership” like the ones in public broadcasting where voluntary payments are extracted through a powerful combination of imposing guilt and offering tote bags</s>

<s>a final straw in the wind steven brill americas most indefatigable serial hitandmiss entrepreneur having just shut down his scheme to sell access to premium security lines at airports announced that his next project would be a company dedicated to helping media of all sorts to charge for content</s>
