<s>a little wisdom would be welcome now as the world turns its back on the naughty noughties and its years of economic calamity illjudged war terrorism and manmade climate change</s>
<s>so here is a challenge for the forthcoming decade beginning in 2010 and ending in 2019 find the right name by which to call it</s>

<s>all names carry baggage</s>
<s>a survey in 2009 for example exposed the prejudice of british teachers who admitted to judging children long before their arrival in the classroom</s>

<s>less clear is what specific label to pick for an era</s>
<s>few time periods are honoured with descriptions the odd annus mirabilis or horribilis aside</s>

<s>but cheer up</s>
<s>a lot will change over the next ten years</s>
<s>sooner or later the current angst will surely lift giving way to a gritty optimism</s>
