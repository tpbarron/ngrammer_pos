<s>over the past year much of the world has experienced falling incomes and sharply rising unemployment</s>
<s>at the height of the global economic crisis in early 2009 a striking warning about the possible political consequences came from americas director of national intelligence admiral dennis blair in testimony before the united states senate</s>
<s>he declared that the risk of global political instability triggered by the economic crisis had become americas “primary nearterm security concern”</s>
<s>the heads of the imf and the un among others also issued stark warnings about the danger of social unrest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far however the feared spread of unrest has not occurred</s>
<s>voters have not flocked to the far left or the populist right</s>
<s>most people affected by the crisis have suffered in silence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>does this mean that all the warnings were misplaced</s>
<s>its too soon to relax</s>
<s>there are reasons to expect that 2010 could be a year of upheaval</s>
<s>the relative social peace of 2009 may have been only the quiet before the storm</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed a congruence of calamities could prove politically tempestuous a sharp rise in unemployment increased poverty and inequality weakened middle classes and high food prices in many countries</s>
<s>austerity is also on the agenda in 2010 following the extreme fiscal relaxation of 2009</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>historically political reactions to economic distress have tended to come with a lag</s>
<s>the same is true of labourmarket developments even once the recession ends unemployment continues to rise</s>
<s>according to economist intelligence unit eiu estimates in 2010 there will be 60m more unemployed worldwide than in 2008</s>
<s>the international labour organisation reckons some 200m workers are at risk of joining the ranks of people living on less than $2 a day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>declines in incomes are not always followed by political instability</s>
<s>vulnerability to unrest depends on a host of factors</s>
<s>these include the degree of income inequality the state of governance levels of social provision ethnic tensions public trust in institutions the history of unrest and the type of political system “intermediate” regimes that are neither consolidated democracies nor autocracies seem the most vulnerable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the places at risk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nearly half the countries assessed by the eiu—77 out of 166—are at very high or high risk of social unrest in 2010 22 are in the veryhighrisk category</s>
<s>for 52 countries the risk of instability is rated as medium and for the remaining 37 countries it is low</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>subsaharan africa is unsurprisingly well represented in the highrisk categories it accounts for about onethird of the highrisk group</s>
<s>almost a quarter of the highrisk countries are in eastern europe the region that has been hit hardest by the crisis and which also has many of the underlying characteristics associated with unrest</s>
<s>a fair number of highrisk countries are in latin america and asia—including the worlds largest and most successful emerging market china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but this is not just an issue for poor countries</s>
<s>in europe protests have toppled governments in latvia and iceland</s>
<s>france is no stranger historically to popular unrest</s>
<s>and in 2010 britain may be at risk</s>
<s>around the world it will be a year for anger management</s>
