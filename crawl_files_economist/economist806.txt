<s>on september 9th hundreds of muslims and jews marched side by side along the streets of berlin in protest at a new local ordinance requiring circumcision to be carried out in a sterile environment with “as little pain as possible” assumed to mean with local anaesthesia and only with both parents’ consent</s>
<s>for both faiths that was an attack on religious freedom</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the merits and costs of circumcision are under scrutiny as never before in rows involving religious leaders humanrights activists and health professionals</s>
<s>some stress the medical benefits</s>
<s>others invoke religious and cultural autonomy and parents’ rights</s>
<s>opponents cite risks including botched cutting</s>
<s>they want ritual infant circumcision banned as a traumatic and anachronistic abuse of babies’ bodies</s>

<p>
<s>a court in another german city cologne ruled three months ago that circumcision of infants and young boys was the illegal infliction of bodily harm</s>
<s>though the case involved a fouryearold muslim boy it aroused fury among germany’s 120000 jews—and others around the world</s>
<s>it was “hard to think of a more appalling decision” britain’s chief rabbi jonathan sachs fumed</s>
<s>angela merkel the chancellor said germany risked becoming a “laughing stock” if jews were no longer allowed to practise their rituals</s>
<s>charlotte knobloch a holocaust survivor and former head of the central council of jews in germany who has spent her life promoting germanjewish reconciliation wondered whether “this country still wants us”</s>

<p>
<s>roughly a third of the global male population including half of all american men are circumcised</s>
<s>in orthodox judaism the procedure is mandatory eight days after a baby’s birth carried out by a mohel a specially trained rabbi without painkillers</s>
<s>removing the foreskin is a core part of both identity and faith a sign of belonging and of god’s covenant</s>
<s>though common among some muslim traditions the koran does not mention it and no specific rules govern the practice most muslim circumcisions are thought to be carried out by relatives</s>
<s>in many african countries male circumcision is a rite of passage sometimes with dire or lethal results</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now legal worries are making doctors in germany and elsewhere nervous</s>
<s>in the austrian province of vorarlberg the authorities have ordered state hospitals to stop all nontherapeutic circumcision pending legal clarification</s>
<s>the royal dutch medical association has called for the practice to be discouraged</s>
<s>in finland a rightwing lawmaker has called for it to be criminalised</s>
<s>in california last year proposals to let local governments ban circumcision made it onto the ballots in some cities including san francisco</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even in new york the city’s health board is poised to adopt rules that some jews complain will allow officials for the first time in american history to dictate details of the ritual</s>
<s>the ordinance will require mohelim to warn parents of the risks involved including infection brain damage or even death in carrying out an ultraorthodox practice in which the mohel briefly sucks blood from the baby’s wound before applying a dressing</s>
<s>city officials say that in the past ten years 11 newly circumcised babies contracted herpes from the procedure two died and two suffered brain damage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hassidic rabbis claim the statistics are flawed and that no risks are run</s>
<s>some 200 say they will ignore the new ordinance</s>
<s>but rabbi gerald skolnik the head of rabbinical assembly an international association of conservative rabbis has praised the city’s move</s>
<s>suction by mouth originally designed to prevent illness at a time of little medical knowledge was not required by jewish law he said</s>
<s>the “serious health risk” involved clashed with judaism’s “preeminent concern with life and human health”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the medical aspects of mainstream circumcision are under review too</s>
<s>maimonides a revered jewish medieval philosopher and physician wrote of “the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question” victorian england believed circumcision stopped boys from masturbating</s>
<s>this says toby lichtig a british jewish writer on the subject was probably what caused the practice to spread to nonjews in britain and america</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>modern medicine has reached a somewhat different conclusion</s>
<s>last month the american academy of paediatrics changed its stance taken in 1999 that the risks of circumcising infants outweighed benefits</s>
<s>now it recommends that the procedure be covered by insurance though it stops short of backing routine circumcision of babies</s>
<s>the shift came after research showed that circumcision reduces the risk of urinarytract infections in the baby’s first year giving a medical reason for carrying it out as early as possible</s>
<s>in addition the academy reckons that for every 909 circumcisions one man will be spared penile cancer</s>
<s>in sexually active males it cuts the transmission of hiv of hpv viruses that cause cervical cancer and of other infections</s>
<s>furthermore the research found no harmful effect on male sexual function or satisfaction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these arguments about health may justify conducting a procedure without the child’s consent</s>
<s>but medicine only partially helps those who defend circumcision as a religious ritual</s>
<s>they also have to justify what critics see as amateur surgery</s>
<s>that could mean dealing with calls for mohelim to undergo medical training many already do or licensing</s>
<s>forswearing the use of painkillers for religious reasons is also a hard sell in secular societies</s>
<s>that the baby is too young to remember what happened is for many childrights advocates an unpersuasive argument</s>
<s>for all that many jews and muslims will not willingly change the practices of generations</s>
