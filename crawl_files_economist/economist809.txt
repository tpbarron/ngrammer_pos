<s>japan is a topdown society</s>
<s>as in books where the characters flow from top to bottom so life is run vertically with seniority often synonymous with age</s>
<s>in politics age is no disqualification for high office the new cabinet is on average over 60</s>
<s>in business the seniority system is entrenched</s>
<s>even in the home hierarchy starts young there is an honorific for little brothers to address their bossy big sisters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how galling then for those down the pecking order that the numbers of people at the top are rising so fast</s>
<s>in 2010 there will be as many middleaged people of 45 and over in japan as there will be people under 45</s>
<s>that not only means more people to bow to</s>
<s>it means more layers to fight through before promotion and more pensioners to support by 2010 4m babyboomers will have retired since 2007—roughly the number of inhabitants of yokohama japans secondlargest city</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this retiring bebi bumu generation has reasons to feel proud of its achievements</s>
<s>over its lifetime industrialisation has transformed japan and the elderly have accumulated savings that many can live off comfortably</s>
<s>but do they merit all the deference they receive</s>
<s>in 2010 there will be several alarming statistics that suggest not</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>for one the economy the worlds secondlargest since the 1960s has lurched so treacherously that it will fall behind chinas in size in 2010 see article</s>
<s>that will make it even more difficult to persuade the world that japan matters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the legacy of not one but two lost decades has saddled japans future generations with a debt whose relative size is unprecedented in the oecd</s>
<s>that organisation reckons gross borrowings will exceed 200 of gdp in 2010</s>
<s>the borrowing may be underpinned by high savings but it has not brought security for japans growing number of jobless and poor people</s>
<s>after a collapse in the economy in 2009 the fiscal deficit is expected by the oecd to rise to nearly 10 in 2010</s>
<s>yet social spending remains low and the more people age the more it is likely to increase</s>
<s>sooner or later the japanese will realise that a country growing old so rapidly cannot live so absurdly beyond its means</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is why the government of yukio hatoyama which swept to power in 2009 ending more than half a century of almost unbroken rule by the liberal democratic party ldp has a devilishly hard task in its first year in office</s>
<s>it was elected because the japanese were sick of the ldps crony capitalism in which government bureaucrats and favoured industries carved up the spoils of the budget</s>
<s>but as it seeks to rebalance the economy by redirecting privileges away from the export and construction industries towards domestic firms it will need to break some labourmarket and wage rigidities</s>
<s>it risks temporarily pushing unemployment higher</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that would be unpalatable unless there were a stronger welfare system and retraining subsidies</s>
<s>but the money for that must compete with government promises of support for families to encourage them to have more children and pension support for the old</s>
<s>it is not clear whether in its 2010 budget the government will be able to cut enough waste to pay for such largesse</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what japan needs is tax reform so that revenues rise</s>
<s>but that is a nonstarter in 2010</s>
<s>the highlight of the political calendar is an upperhouse election in the summer in which mr hatoyamas democratic party of japan hopes for a majority so that it can pass legislation in both houses without coalition partners</s>
<s>to achieve that the danger is that the new government will err on the side of timidity and squander its political capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the government cannot right the ship can business</s>
<s>its flair for innovation and design is legendary in 2010 nissan will bring the allelectric leaf to the streets of japan and america and it will warn pedestrians of its approach with a futuristic sound reminiscent of the flying cars in “blade runner”</s>
<s>there may even be a chance for fresh thinking in the monolithic keidanren business chamber after the election of a new leader in june</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but business too is often a slowmoving gerontocracy hidebound by a reluctance to let creative individuals make quick decisions</s>
<s>it ought to pile into china and south korea in 2010 given the decline of the american consumer market</s>
<s>but it is likely that the government will make the greater inroads</s>
<s>mr hatoyama has reached out to both countries and on the 100th anniversary of japans occupation of korea in 1910 there is even an invitation for emperor akihito to visit seoul</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what japan really needs in 2010 is the sort of onceinageneration change in business management that came to politics in 2009 that is the realisation that those who make mistakes however senior can be kicked out and replaced by fresh thinkers</s>
<s>it is too much to hope it will happen in a year</s>
<s>but it had better start soon</s>
