<s>the world will not end in 2012</s>
<s>“too bad” cynics will retort</s>
<s>for those who are in varying degrees more optimistic 2012 will be a year of balancing acts</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the arab spring will pass into another summer and whether it will be long and parched or a genial transition to mellow fruitfulness will depend on how healthy a balance can be achieved between the conflicting goals and expectations of numerous players</s>
<s>there will be those who emphasise economic and social development and those who focus on political reform</s>
<s>the necessary balance can be achieved only by recognising that neither will be sustainable without the other</s>

<s>the end of authoritarianism is not synonymous with the disappearance of dissension or the demise of fundamentalism</s>
<s>dissension in itself is not inimical to balance if it is handled through processes that promote compromise and consensus</s>
<s>fundamentalism which often becomes more intense in times of change and uncertainty however is the natural enemy of balance</s>
<s>the peoples of the newly liberated countries will have to decide how to balance their psychological and material needs</s>
<s>the big powers that are eager to promote stability will also have to join in the balancing act trying to achieve harmony between strategic interests the aspirations of the peoples concerned and the means available </s>

<p>
<s>terrorism will remain a preoccupation</s>
<s>the tragedy of norways utøya island has demonstrated with frightening clarity that a single individual who is mad enough and determined enough can wreak as much havoc as extremist organisations with access to arsenals of lethal weapons</s>
<s>even the greatest powers now accept that military solutions alone are not the answer to the terrorist problem</s>
<s>the terrorist mentality is spawned by intellectual and social influences that widen to an extreme the gap between “us” and “others”</s>
<s>this destroys the essential balance that promotes a sense of the common bond of humanity</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>how is such a balance to be restored</s>
<s>the answer lies in measures that will help to instil in people a feeling of their worth as individuals</s>
<s>those who need to terrorise others to prove their own worth are lacking in genuine selfrespect</s>
<s>a person who cannot respect himself is incapable of respecting others he cannot know compassion nor restraint when faced with what he considers an opportunity to get back at those he holds responsible for the constraints that have been placed on his capacity to find a satisfactory niche</s>

<s>when teenagers went on the rampage in the united kingdom in the summer of 2011 there was dismay horror mystification</s>
<s>what had gone wrong</s>
<s>the thought of so much discontent and anger in so many young people so much latent violence waiting to erupt at the least provocation is terrifying</s>
<s>this implies very real deprivation which in an affluent society denotes grave dysfunction a lack of the essential balance that maintains harmony between different interest groups</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>measures aimed at ameliorating social ills require substantial funding</s>
<s>for countries trying to regain control of the economy through spending cuts and debt ceilings it will not be easy to fulfil the requirements of communities trapped in hopelessness</s>
<s>in the united states 2012 is a presidentialelection year which will make it particularly important and particularly difficult to reach decisions that balance the longterm needs of the nation with the shortterm fixes that will attract votes</s>

<s>new years resolution</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>asia will continue to do well economically but political social and environmental concerns will demand increasingly urgent attention</s>
<s>to ignore this would be to store up trouble for the future</s>
<s>the rising powers of the east china and india will have to aim at more than the achievement of a more equitable economic and social climate within their own countries they will also have to work towards harmony in their relations with other countries of the region</s>
<s>if the strategic balance of the world is to change every effort must be made to ensure that it changes in a direction that will promote peace and stability</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a positive development that has gathered strength over the past year has been the rise of civic consciousness the acceptance by ordinary citizens that they too must play a part in the process of change and adaptation</s>
<s>this is not so much protest against the inadequacies of government as recognition of the importance of balancing rights with responsibilities</s>
<s>it is usually in crisis conditions that individual initiatives emerge to meet public challenges and there will be no lack of crises—economic environmental governmental and international—in the years to come</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in conclusion i confess that i have more faith in resolution than in prediction</s>
<s>i would like to see 2012 as the year when international and national organisations and governments and peoples resolve to work towards a more safely and happily balanced world</s>
