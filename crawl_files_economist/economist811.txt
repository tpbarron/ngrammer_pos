<s>there are moments of madness that sear a generation leaving scars that only the truth can heal</s>
<s>the hillsborough football disaster on april 15th 1989 is one</s>
<s>ninetysix men women and children died when incompetent stewarding mainly by police at an fa cup semifinal let a flood of liverpool fans into a standing terrace at an old stadium in sheffield</s>
<s>on the lookout for hooliganism the police failed to spot in time that people were collapsing from the crush of bodies not booze or fisticuffs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>since that day a raft of inquiries inquests litigation and disciplinary investigations have failed to explain events to the satisfaction of the bereaved families</s>
<s>they kept fighting for answers</s>
<s>in january 2010 the government of the day appointed an independent panel to oversee full disclosure of relevant information and produce a report</s>
<s>this it did on september 12th</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the safety of the crowd admitted to the terrace was compromised at every level the panel found</s>
<s>once the emergency was recognised the response to it was poorly handled—by the emergency services as well as the police</s>
<s>up to 41 of the people who died had a chance of surviving</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>almost as bad was the “strenuous” effort made by the south yorkshire police to shift the blame from senior officers to liverpool fans</s>
<s>the media were fed the line that fans had been drunk and violent</s>
<s>comments reflecting badly on the police were erased from coppers’ notes 116 statements were altered</s>
<s>the panel’s careful catalogue suggests that the worst sporting disaster in british history may also be the worst police coverup of all time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>much has changed since hillsborough</s>
<s>football is virtually unrecognisable</s>
<s>in 1992 the premier league was formed bringing far more money into the sport and speeding improvements in stadiums</s>
<s>hooliganism at home at any rate has all but vanished</s>
<s>policing has been transformed too—not least by modern communications and more rigorous oversight—though police defending their own sounds dispiritingly modern</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what now</s>
<s>families are jubilant that their campaign has paid off</s>
<s>justice may follow the attorneygeneral is to review the new information and prosecutions could ensue</s>
<s>but one injustice can never be put right</s>
<s>that it has taken 23 years to explain the hillsborough disaster and its aftermath is a scandal in itself</s>
