<s>that leung chunying who took over as hong kong’s leader in july is close to the powers that be in beijing is not news</s>
<s>under british colonial rule the man known to all as “cy” was singled out more than 20 years ago as someone china’s leaders could trust</s>
<s>and his denials have never entirely quelled suspicions that among his trustworthy credentials is a communist party membership card which under hong kong laws would bar him from his new job</s>
<s>it is also well known that hong kong’s people jealous of the freedoms they enjoyed under the british and since 1997 as a special administrative region of china fear losing them in a creeping process of absorption by the mainland</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so it is surprising that rather than trying to allay these fears mr leung by design or political leadenfootedness has been stoking them</s>
<s>since being anointed “chief executive” as the post is called in a nod to the curious notion that hong kong is not a “political” city he has been bogged down in one row after another about perceived mainland encroachment</s>
<s>so heated have passions become that even what might be sensible measures from his government are denounced as sinister plots</s>
<s>the ability of mr leung’s administration to govern hong kong for the next five years or longer cannot be taken for granted</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even a calamity this month when 39 people died after a collision between two boats by an outlying island did not bring the solidarity of shared grief</s>
<s>instead mr leung’s handling of the crisis prompted questions about china’s role</s>
<s>why was li gang of its liaison office in hong kong at his side when he visited survivors in hospital</s>
<s>why did china’s official press give prominence to party leaders’ “important instructions” to “spare no effort” in dealing with the disaster</s>
<s>did mr leung really need to be told</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr leung’s supporters could not blame the episode on policies left over from the previous administration as they do with many of the other alleged signs of “mainlandisation”</s>
<s>even on the other issues however that argument is not very convincing mr leung has pursued unpopular policies introduced under his predecessor until forced to back down</s>
<s>the most bruising clash was over plans to introduce “national education”—taken to mean probeijing propaganda—into schools’ curriculums</s>
<s>hong kong’s people can put up with a lot says emily lau a prodemocracy politician but “if you mess around with their kids they’re going to come out” they did in large numbers as many as 100000 people at one point</s>
<s>on the eve of an election to the legislative council legco last month mr leung climbed down on the issue</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now he is promoting another controversial plan for the development first mooted before the handover from britain of three new towns near the border with the exploding chinese city of shenzhen</s>
<s>the government has advertised the location as a way of achieving closer integration with the mainland neighbour</s>
<s>that is precisely what many in hong kong fear so the plan falls prey to the same suspicions of china</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr leung has made some effort to show he is not a puppet of the chinese government</s>
<s>besides ditching the plans for national education he also reversed a decision to allow easy entry to hong kong for 41m migrants from elsewhere in china living in shenzhen</s>
<s>in another reaction to local fears of being swamped by mainlanders and priced out of the housing market he announced a plan for “hong kong land for hong kong people” on the site of the old airport</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he also says a colleague tried to appoint christine loh a wellknown local activist as his environment secretary despite what china’s leaders would see as serious blots on her record an appointment to legco by chris patten the last british governor and the founding of a prodemocracy party</s>
<s>when china drew the line at her joining his cabinet he gave her a more junior role</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr leung however has not really gone out of his way to distance himself from mainlandisation</s>
<s>on the contrary his speech to mark china’s national day on october 1st chose to stress the importance of integration with china which has indeed been part of hong kong’s continued success rather than the differences from china which are another part</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so mr leung’s popularity according to polls is falling and his critics after the nationaleducation debacle have tasted blood</s>
<s>they have learned that as in 2003 when mass demonstrations thwarted the introduction of an “antisubversion” law and ultimately toppled one of mr leung’s predecessors the way to get things done or undone in hong kong is to take to the streets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is a consequence in part of unrepresentative politics and a system where elections are not the way to effect political change</s>
<s>mr leung was appointed in march by a process more like a board meeting than a genuine election</s>
<s>legco’s members have little real power and are elected under byzantine arrangements designed to ensure a “proestablishment” majority even though the prodemocracy camp always wins more votes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more or less</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although the prodemocracy camp fared rather badly in september’s poll some of its more extreme members did well</s>
<s>the rigged system is leading to a radicalisation of mainstream politics and a greater reliance on street movements</s>
<s>this will be eyed nervously in beijing especially in light of recent provocations banners reading “chinese go back to china” and even a glimpse of the old colonial colours that incorporate the british union flag</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is however a predictable consequence of a system that affords political freedom without democratic accountability</s>
<s>an obvious solution would be fairer broaderbased elections</s>
<s>china’s leaders have promised the chief executive will be chosen by “universal suffrage” in 2017 when mr leung will be hoping for a second term</s>
<s>but they may yet ensure that only candidates they approve are allowed</s>
<s>recent events might make them wonder if the answer is not more democracy but less freedom</s>
