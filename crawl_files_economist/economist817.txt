<s>if only the games business were so simple</s>
<s>last month sony decided to shut its liverpool studio famous for creating the “wipeout” series of games in the 1990s</s>
<s>that was one of several closures of leading studios over the past few years</s>

<s>britishmade home computers such as the zx spectrum and the bbc micro in combination with good teaching in schools meant that british teenagers often learned to program long before their foreign peers</s>

<p>
<s>these advantages have faded</s>
<s>“information technology” pushed computer science off the school curriculum towards the end of the 20th century creating a skills shortage</s>

<s>in march george osborne the chancellor announced the introduction of a tax break similar to one offered to film producers</s>

<s>the industry is fast evolving says jason kingsley the cofounder of oxfordbased rebellion developments and in a way that benefits independent developers of which there are many in britain</s>
<s>until recently his company produced games on commission to be distributed by publishers with lots of warehouse space and links to retailers</s>
<s>now however rebellion can distribute its games directly through apple’s app store and similar services</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that side of the games industry is booming</s>
<s>fully 216 new games companies were started in britain between 2008 and 2011 says tiga many of them by staff made redundant by bigger studios</s>
<s>since codemasters closed its studio in guildford last year the area has become a hub for video games development says patrick o’luanaigh founder of ndreams a company which makes iphone and playstation home games</s>
<s>he now employs 30 people</s>

<s>these smaller developers face a more competitive environment than they used to</s>
<s>but there is plenty of reward for those who succeed</s>
<s>boss alien a firm which emerged from the ashes of black rock studio in brighton recently produced an iphone game “csr racing” which made $12m in a month</s>
<s>if others can emulate its success the game will not be over for some time yet</s>
