<s>watching television advertisements for john barrow’s reelection campaign it is hard to tell whether he is a republican or a democrat</s>
<s>in a studiedly folksy manner he explains how he rejects the nostrums of both parties</s>
<s>he is a strong ally of the national rifle association which irks democrats</s>
<s>he refuses to turn over medicare to private insurers as many republicans would like</s>
<s>he bucked both parties by voting against the “wall street bailout”</s>
<s>he has voted at times with and at times against both barack obama and eric cantor the leader of the republican majority in the house of representatives</s>
<s>“john’s independent all right” a greyhaired woman in a housedress avers</s>
<s>“john will work with anyone to bring jobs to georgia” declares a jowly man in a baseball cap</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as it happens mr barrow is a democrat</s>
<s>as his ads suggest he is a moderate who often goes against the party line—most notably when he voted against mr obama’s healthcare reforms</s>
<s>more doctrinaire democrats dismiss him as a “republicrat”</s>
<s>his republican opponent meanwhile has dubbed him “barrobama” arguing that his claims of centrism are mere posturing</s>
<s>partisans on both sides agree on one thing about him however that he will struggle to win reelection</s>
<s>the republicans who run georgia’s state legislature removed a lot of democrats when they redrew his district last year leaving it with a decided republican slant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr barrow is not by any means the only endangered moderate in congress</s>
<s>a republican gerrymander in north carolina reversing the democratic one that preceded it is proving a challenge for several more socially conservative “bluedog” democrats</s>
<s>the bluedog caucus in fact has shrunk from 54 members in 2010 to 24 today</s>
<s>five of those are retiring or have recently two have lost primaries and seven more including mr barrow face stiff competition</s>
<s>if mr barrow loses there will not be a single white democratic representative in the five states of the deep south—a total reversal from 50 years ago</s>
<s>republicans are becoming almost as rare in new england</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>meanwhile several moderate republicans face uphill battles in illinois among other places thanks to democratic gerrymanders</s>
<s>a similar shift is under way in the senate a few centrists such as ben nelson a democrat from nebraska and olympia snowe a republican from maine are retiring under fire while others including jon tester a democrat from montana and scott brown a republican from massachusetts are behind in the polls</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>malign consequences</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this will leave the next congress even more polarised and paralysed than the present one</s>
<s>as it is party discipline and thus antagonism between the two sides has grown dramatically in recent years</s>
<s>last year 71 of votes pitted a majority of democrats against a majority of republicans compared with just 32 in 1970 according to data compiled by congressional quarterly part of the economist group</s>
<s>no wonder then that this congress has been the least productive since the second world war—by a big margin</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>moderates in both parties used to give one another cover says dan glickman a former democratic congressman from kansas and prevent legislation from being dismissed as partisan</s>
<s>nowadays he laments thanks to gerrymandering and the increasing expense of running a campaign most congressmen’s survival depends not on the electorate as a whole but on a small pool of doctrinaire donors and primary voters who do not prize messy centrist compromises</s>
<s>“we’re no longer governing—everything is seen through the prism of politics” sighs ms snowe who is retiring because she sees little prospect of any improvement</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that does not necessarily mean that the next congress will fail to come up with a deficitreduction deal argues james thurber of american university</s>
<s>but he does believe it will take strong external pressure of some sort to make it happen</s>
<s>the most likely source would be the financial markets whose swoon in 2008 prompted many congressmen but not mr barrow to reconsider their opposition to a bailout of foundering banks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bob bennett a former republican senator from utah sacked by his state party for ideological lapses including a vote for the bank bailout foresees an electoral backlash against such purism</s>
<s>“if we are seen in 2014 as the tea party we are going to get killed” he predicts</s>
<s>many republicans he argues attribute the party’s failure to take control of the senate in 2010 to extreme candidates propelled through the primaries by teaparty activists</s>
<s>this year he notes several relative moderates pitted by redistricting in primaries against teaparty types managed to survive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but in several other republican senate primaries this year tea partiers did manage to defeat more moderate candidates</s>
<s>back in georgia mr barrow faces lee anderson a paunchy republican farmer with hooded eyes and a thick drawl</s>
<s>his website declares “barack obama is a socialist who is destroying our great country and john barrow…is one of obama’s biggest enablers” it is not exactly a call to reconciliation—and it does not seem to be doing mr anderson any harm</s>
