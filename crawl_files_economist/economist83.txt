<s>much modern manufacturing takes place on spotless shop floors with only the lightest sprinkling of staff to monitor the purring machinery</s>
<s>so tata steel’s works at port talbot in south wales come across as reassuringly gritty and oldschool</s>
<s>the site is vast</s>
<s>a drive round its private roadways clocks up a dozen or so miles</s>
<s>a visitor passes hulking edifices from coke ovens to huge steelrolling mills and finds a whiff of desolation too</s>
<s>the makers of “doctor who” a sciencefiction television series have asked to use the moonscape created by mounds of coal and ore as a backdrop</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at least one corner of the works is teeming as one of the site’s two blast furnaces is replaced</s>
<s>the old furnace was snuffed out in july after 20 years’ service</s>
<s>the new one will be built around a steel shell made of 14 tiers</s>
<s>each has to be carefully lifted by a giant mobile crane which itself had first to be assembled</s>
<s>a convoy of lorries was required to bring it to wales</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as the tiers pile higher a small army of welders pipefitters and electricians works at close quarters to reconnect the furnace to the works’ infrastructure</s>
<s>a cadre of specialists from portugal stands ready to line the furnace shell with heatresistant bricks</s>
<s>in total around 800 contractors are working on the new furnace at any time the factory’s regular workforce is 3500</s>
<s>the bill comes to £185m $296m</s>
<s>tata reckons it is the biggest capital project in british industry this year</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>admittedly the competition is not strong</s>
<s>investment across the economy has been sluggish</s>
<s>firms have been reluctant to splash out on big capital projects</s>
<s>demand is still weak and many calculate that a cash buffer may prove vital if the eurozone crisis worsens</s>
<s>and steel is even more depressed than most richworld industries thanks in part to a slump in construction</s>
<s>output remains below precrisis levels even in the more resilient economies of america and germany</s>
<s>production in britain this year is likely to be around a third below its 2007 level</s>
<s>if so it would mark a new low point in what appears to be a longterm decline</s>
<s>the slide was only briefly reversed in the years before tata bought corus the anglodutch firm that evolved from the privatised british steel corporation see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so why invest in steel now</s>
<s>in part the decision reflects tata’s longterm thinking says jon ferriman the local boss</s>
<s>britain has some lively manufacturing sectors including carmaking which need highquality steel sourced locally</s>
<s>the right time to invest is when output is weak he adds</s>
<s>tata’s other furnaces can take up the slack and keep port talbot’s rolling mills supplied with slabs of steel</s>
<s>the new furnace will be more efficient than the one it replaces</s>
<s>tata is making £53m of related investments this year to reduce energy costs by recycling the gasses that are a byproduct of steelmaking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but sceptics wonder if the economic case for steelmaking in britain still adds up</s>
<s>wales supplied the world with iron in its 19thcentury heyday when the industry was built upon an abundant local supply of ores coal timber and limestone</s>
<s>these days the more refined sorts of metals demanded in carmaking or aerospace require the machinery and knowhow that is still found mostly in rich countries</s>
<s>but the job of basic steelmaking is combining bulky ingredients which are expensive to move into a final product that has less weight</s>
<s>this gives a cost advantage to producers in emerging economies who have raw materials nearby</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>steelmaking in china and other emerging countries has boomed even as it languishes in rich countries</s>
<s>tata’s european operation has been making losses</s>
<s>profits are squeezed from both ends</s>
<s>weak local demand bears down on the price of finished steel while china’s growing hunger for ores and energy keeps rawmaterial costs high</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>relief may yet be found closer to home</s>
<s>beneath the land around the port talbot factory lies an estimated 380m tonnes of coking coal</s>
<s>tata is examining the business case for mining it</s>
<s>the project is five to eight years away if it happens at all says mr ferriman</s>
<s>if it were to go ahead though it would create work for 500 miners—as well as another grimy landscape for britain’s tv producers</s>
