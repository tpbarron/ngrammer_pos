<s>chile’s government wants the country to be heaven for entrepreneurs</s>
<s>but it is putting one young startup through regulatory hell</s>
<s>since it was launched in may cumplo a peertopeer lending business has been embroiled in a legal spat that highlights just how difficult it is for newcomers to break into chile’s lucrative financialservices sector</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>cumplo is the brainchild of nicolas shea the founder of startup chile see article and the head of the country’s national association of entrepreneurs</s>
<s>mr shea says he launched his new business because he was shocked by the interest rates—sometimes 50 or more—that chilean banks charge for small personal loans</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>inspired by the example of america’s prospercom which runs an online marketplace that lets people lend money directly to other folk cumplo has already seen 205m pesos $432000 of loans made via its own digital platform</s>
<s>borrowers are delighted</s>
<s>cumplo puts them in touch with lenders who charge far less than chilean banks</s>
<s>savers benefit too since cumplo offers them a new way to make their savings grow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet chile’s banking regulator is miffed</s>
<s>shortly after its launch cumplo got a letter from the watchdog stating it was violating chile’s banking law which stipulates that only licensed banks may accept deposits</s>
<s>the firm wrote back explaining why it believed it was not breaking the rules since it does not take deposits per se it only connects borrowers and lenders</s>
<s>the regulator then passed its case to criminal investigators who have been probing its operations</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>raphael bergoeing a banking supervisor says government lawyers insist that cumplo has broken the rules</s>
<s>he adds that other firms hoping to create peertopeer lending businesses have given up after similar warnings</s>
<s>but cumplo says it has a legal opinion from a former general counsel of chile’s central bank explaining that its business is perfectly legal</s>
<s>some prominent figures have also backed it</s>
<s>“the banking regulator is applying an interpretation of the law in cumplo’s case that is unnecessarily strict” says juan andrés fontaine a former economy minister</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some see in the regulator’s stance an attempt to shield a cosy industry from the chill winds of competition</s>
<s>mr shea who has ambitions to create a panlatin american peertopeer lending empire says he is determined to fight on though he admits the legal tussle “is a roulette situation</s>
<s>anything could happen” if his startup is forced to shut down chile will lose credit in more ways than one</s>
