<s>the semiconductor plant at roborough on the outskirts of plymouth is not everyone’s idea of architectural beauty</s>
<s>it has the gasstorage containers and vacuum pumps that are a familiar part of the industrial landscape</s>
<s>prince charles who opened the factory in 1987 said it looked like a hightech victorian prison</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the plant was built by plessey one of britain’s largest companies until it was carved up in 1989 by two rivals gec and siemens after a long and bitter takeover battle</s>
<s>plessey’s old militaryequipment business is buried within bae systems the bit that made telephone systems is now part of ericsson</s>
<s>but its semiconductor arm lives again</s>
<s>the plymouth plant—and the plessey name—is coming back to life under michael legoff a canadian entrepreneur</s>
<s>his bold bet is that the sort of manufacturing that has drifted eastward can thrive again in britain</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>modern chipmaking is capitalintensive</s>
<s>it costs intel the industry giant several billion dollars to build a foundry to make newgeneration computer chips</s>
<s>most new ones are in asia</s>
<s>britain has instead specialised in design arm the cambridge firm behind the chips used in iphones does no manufacturing</s>
<s>but mr legoff thinks designers work better if production is on their doorstep</s>
<s>a design fault is harder to fix if the foundry is thousands of miles away</s>
<s>and there are happier accidents</s>
<s>by tinkering plessey’s engineers found they could make one component for a fraction of its list price</s>
<s>“our manufacturing capability helps us to discover quickly what is possible” says mr legoff</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the factory would have no such inner charm were it not for the outer solidity that the prince found so offputting</s>
<s>the building’s concrete pillars go 30 feet into a granite bedrock</s>
<s>the smallest tremor would disrupt the delicate work inside a hairbreadth’s error is ruinous in the making of microchips</s>
<s>so would dust or fibres</s>
<s>the two clean rooms where chips are made are sprucer than a hospital theatre</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such assets are valuable</s>
<s>plessey makes analogue chips which digitise and process signals such as sound and light rather than the digital sort that intel makes for computers</s>
<s>though analogue plants are not as vast building one from scratch would still cost hundreds of millions of dollars</s>
<s>plessey’s is kept busy by contracts from bigger firms</s>
<s>its chips are in products from settop boxes to xray machines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but mr legoff wants plessey to make its own products</s>
<s>it is placing two big bets</s>
<s>the first is on its epic sensor developed with sussex university which has won several design awards</s>
<s>this can detect tiny changes in electrical fields from a distance even through textiles</s>
<s>that allows it to track gestures like the wave of a hand</s>
<s>its low cost gives it massmarket potential—from doityourself health checks to car kit that checks drivers’ alertness to “smart bedding” for monitoring infants or the sick</s>
<s>it might even keep smartphones and computer tablets free from sticky fingers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>plessey’s other big venture is lightemitting diodes leds for lighting homes and offices</s>
<s>leds use a fraction of the electricity of regular lightbulbs and can be used for decades</s>
<s>the market is expected to grow rapidly but plessey is up against mighty competitors like ge philips samsung and siemens</s>
<s>mr legoff says plessey has an edge</s>
<s>it can make led lights at a fraction of the cost of rivals thanks to a unique process developed at cambridge university</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the revived plessey is a small outfit with revenues last year of £105m $165m</s>
<s>but it has brand value beyond its scale not least among the many engineers who learned their trade there</s>
<s>it is using ideas from british universities that might otherwise leak abroad</s>
<s>like many small firms it has little support from banks instead it is backed by small privateequity outfits</s>
<s>there is room at plymouth to expand</s>
<s>if things go well perhaps prince charles will be invited back to open the extension</s>
