<s>geography has not been kind to syria</s>
<s>porous borders and a diverse population have made it a perpetually weak polity tempting countless invaders since the dawn of civilisation</s>
<s>invasion has lately fallen out of fashion but the world’s powers still see syria as a place about which something must be done</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at least three diplomatic initiatives are currently afloat</s>
<s>the newly appointed joint special envoy of the arab league and united nations lakhdar brahimi is slowly making his way to damascus for preliminary talks with the syrian president bashar assad via new york cairo and tehran</s>
<s>russia mr assad’s prime diplomatic and military backer has renewed calls for a broad conference of all syria’s warring sides</s>
<s>and egypt invigorated under a muslim brotherhood president muhammad morsi is joining saudi arabia turkey and iran the sole shia power among sunni muslim states in an effort to hammer out a solution to syria’s woes</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>none of this looks likely to go very far</s>
<s>mr brahimi has taken pains to lower expectations—unsurprisingly since on the ground syria’s combatants are locked in a bloody death grip determined to fight to the end</s>
<s>russia’s hope of corralling unwilling opposition factions while shielding mr assad seems unrealistic</s>
<s>and egypt’s effort though laudable has quickly run into bumps</s>
<s>with typical helpfulness iran isolated as mr assad’s sole regional ally now suggests expanding the quartet to include its friends iraq and venezuela</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>while complaining about what it describes as an international conspiracy against mr assad iran continues to supply him with arms military expertise fuel and money helped by its lebanese militia protégé hizbullah and the shiadominated and increasingly sectarianminded government of nuri almaliki in iraq</s>
<s>the region’s sunni powers bolstered by a network of private individuals many with a fiercely antishia outlook finance and arm syria’s rebels via a compliant turkey and with the enthusiastic help of sunni factions in lebanon and iraq</s>
<s>western countries chip in with cash and “nonlethal” aid—which may include radios intelligence and nightvision gear—yet their shyness bolsters rebel suspicions that the west at the bidding of israel deviously seeks to prolong syria’s misery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this is beginning to exacerbate the region’s many festering tensions</s>
<s>with their mixed sunni and shia populations and legacy of civil strife both lebanon and iraq are increasingly on a knifeedge</s>
<s>the wave of bombings targeting shias that shook iraq on september 8th and 9th was the secondworst violence since america pulled out its troops last december</s>
<s>lebanon’s second city tripoli has repeatedly flared up in communal violence</s>
<s>minority shias in kuwait and saudi arabia complain of increasingly vicious sectarian baiting by sunni radicals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the kurdistan workers party pkk emboldened by covert support from mr assad has sharply ramped up its 30year insurgency in turkey</s>
<s>the past 14 months have been the most violent in a decade leaving some 700 dead</s>
<s>turkey’s large alawite minority identifies increasingly with their embattled coreligionists in syria resenting their mildly islamist government’s backing for the mostly sunni opposition</s>
<s>jordan too is being buffeted by syria’s winds and not only because of the influx of more than 150000 refugees</s>
<s>indecision and corruption at the top have encouraged a growing wave of dissent with king abdullah now for the first time becoming the butt of protests much like those that sparked syria’s descent into strife</s>
