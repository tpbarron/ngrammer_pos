<s>the euro areas debt crisis which started as a little local difficulty in greece in early 2010 will become existential in 2012</s>
<s>a muddlethrough approach will probably just prevail</s>
<s>procrastinating european politicians may not do enough to keep the single currency together</s>
<s>but the european central bank ecb under its new leader mario draghi of italy can act swiftly and with massive firepower through creating money if the alternative is the breakup of the euro zone</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but if muddling through is the most likely outcome the risk of a breakup is uncomfortably high</s>
<s>the single currencys survival in its present shape is no longer assured</s>
<s>the euro area could fragment</s>
<s>in theory this could happen in one of two ways a germanled exodus of northern creditworthy countries or a forced departure of insolvent countries greece to the fore</s>
<s>only one of these is plausible in practice</s>
<s>germany will not destroy the euro and thereby endanger the european union itself</s>
<s>the breakup if it occurs will start with a greek exit </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>poor poor greece</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the politics of greek austerity may prove to be the determining factor</s>
<s>the turmoil emanating from athens in the days after the rescue deal set out at the european summit in october showed this dramatically</s>
<s>suppose the deal holds</s>
<s>and suppose the 50 loss imposed on the face value of bonds held by private creditors stops the countrys crushing debt burden from rising yet further it would have jumped from 162 of gdp in 2011 to 183 in 2012 it will take until 2020 to fall to 120 a still oppressive level</s>
<s>the greeks will face a desperately tough year with the economy continuing to shrink following three years of recession which have cumulatively reduced gdp by 12</s>
<s>and the task of becoming competitive enough to be able to cope with the rigours of the single currency will remain formidable since domestic costs still need to fall by around a quarter </s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as economic hardship and social unrest intensify an upsurge in outraged greek nationalism could prompt an even more swingeing default and an exit</s>
<s>advocates of a greek departure from the euro area can point to argentinas experience after a tenyear experiment in dollarising its economy ended in a huge default and depreciation in 200102</s>
<s>after a further relapse argentinas economy grew by 9 in 2003 and carried on expanding at around that rate until checked by the financial crisis and recession of 200809</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet the shortterm damage greece might suffer could be a lot bigger and it would not benefit from the commodities boom which helped argentina</s>
<s>any hint of a withdrawal from the single currency in which domestic loans and deposits would be switched into the new drachma would turn the slowmotion withdrawal of deposits down by a tenth in the first half of 2011 into a fully fledged bank run bringing down the greek banking system</s>
<s>debts to foreign creditors would soar as the drachma fell against the euro</s>
<s>the government could rescue itself by redenominating its bonds into drachma but businesses owing euros under foreignlaw contracts would remain on the hook causing them either to default or to fold</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>worse greece might find itself cast out of the eu as well</s>
<s>joining the euro is supposed to be irrevocable a “hotel california” which you can never leave</s>
<s>since the european treaties make no provision for a country quitting some lawyers insist that any such departure must entail leaving the eu</s>
<s>although politics could trump such legalities a badtempered exit might hinder an amicable settlement</s>
<s>greece would lose not just valuable regionalsupport funds from the eu budget but also—and far more important—vital access to the european single market vitiating much of its competitive gain from the falling new drachma</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and thats just what greece would go through</s>
<s>the wider danger in 2012 is that a greek departure could precipitate unbearable stresses in the euro area as a whole</s>
<s>depositors in other vulnerable economies could take fright and withdraw their funds from their banking systems</s>
<s>this might be manageable if confined to ireland and portugal two other small bailedout economies but it could be overwhelming if the bank runs spread to italy and spain french banks could also find themselves under threat</s>
<s>in principle the ecb could fight such runs with massive liquidity support</s>
<s>but such ­action would be politically controversial and its resolve might be weakened by fears of the large losses it would incur if in spite of everything countries did nonetheless quit the euro</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>worries about a breakup causing defaults bust banks and economic collapse—let alone dealing a devastating blow to europes idea of “ever closer union”—are the strongest reason to expect that european leaders will eventually contrive an escape out of the crisis</s>
<s>but accidents can occur</s>
<s>and the uncertainty will blight the euroarea economy even if the muddlethrough strategy does work </s>
