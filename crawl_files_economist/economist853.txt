<s>in november 2010 californians will vote in a pair of ballot measures to call a constitutional convention</s>
<s>if polls are right their approval of these measures is all but assured</s>
<s>californians are fed up with the dysfunctional governance that periodically turns their state into a laughing stock</s>
<s>they want a new constitution</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>their disdain for the existing one is well deserved</s>
<s>it is among the most convoluted such texts in the world ranking with alabamas and indias as one of the longest</s>
<s>it contrasts starkly with the minimalist elegance of americas constitution adopted in 1787 or alaskas ratified in 1956</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>californias first constitutional convention took place in 1849 before california was even admitted to the union</s>
<s>a second convention in 1879 tried to right every possible wrong and produced a tome</s>
<s>to this was added during the progressive era of the early 20th century direct democracy—with referendums recalls and voter initiatives</s>
<s>such initiatives have since produced more than 500 constitutional amendments</s>
<s>americas constitution a century older has been amended 27 times</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>among the quirks in californias current document are 1 a requirement from 1933 for twothirds majorities in both houses of the legislature to pass a budget and 2 the same twothirds requirement added by voters in the infamous proposition 13 of 1978 to increase any tax</s>
<s>two other states rhode island and arkansas have this requirement for budgets and several others have it for raising taxes but only california has it for both</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if californias legislature contained moderates normal fiscal management might still be imaginable</s>
<s>but the moderates have left</s>
<s>californian elections as governor arnold schwarzenegger has frequently complained are won or lost in the party primaries of gerrymandered districts that encourage extremism</s>
<s>democrats may be in the majority but naysaying republicans can block any budget and habitually do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the element of direct democracy exacerbates the situation by ensuring that the inmates—ie the voters—run much of the asylum</s>
<s>voters pass for example “tough on crime” sentencing laws with nary a thought about paying for more prisons</s>
<s>when their elected representatives subsequently cannot muster twothirds to raise taxes or cut another part of the budget voters then profess shock at their incompetence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thus the state lurches from one fiscal crisis to the next</s>
<s>last summer california even had to issue ious in lieu of cheques to its creditors</s>
<s>the appeal of starting afresh with a clean constitution is obvious</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the idea immediately brings to mind philadelphia in 1787 where 55 of the most august minds ever assembled shuttled between independence hall and the city tavern for four muggy months of secret deliberations</s>
<s>despite daunting conflicts—who today owns slaves—they produced the most robust constitution in history</s>
<s>surely airconditioned california can have a go</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>missing madisons</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and yet who would be californias “founding fathers”</s>
<s>thomas jefferson absent from philadelphia as minister to france called the 55 delegates chosen by the states “demigods”</s>
<s>these were men such as james madison deeply versed in aristotle cicero locke and montesquieu who preferred the word “republic” to “democracy” for fear that the latter might evoke the chaos of ancient athens</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if california has intellects of this stature it certainly has none with madisons nonpartisan credibility</s>
<s>instead there is a fear that the states entrenched interests from the prisonguards union to party bureaucracies or “prop 13” fanatics will take over the process and make it a microcosm of the states dystopia</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>hoping to meet these concerns the organisation behind the ballot measures repair california proposes a random jurylike draft of ordinary citizens as delegates</s>
<s>“average californians are the only ones who can lead our state out of the quagmire of special interests and partisanship” argues one adviser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but can lay people be expected to assume the responsibilities of a madison</s>
<s>as jurors citizens deliberate on binary questions of guilt after hearing evidence under the guidance of a judge</s>
<s>in a constitutional convention the questions will be complex and large</s>
<s>who would present the evidence if not the same loonies who cannot agree in the legislature</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the irony that california is preparing to reinforce its populist instincts with yet more direct democracy would surely be too much to bear for madison the “republican” founding father</s>
