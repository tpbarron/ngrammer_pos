<s>to the surprise of everybody but toru hashimoto a local political insurrection centred on the industrial powerhouse of osaka has now set all japan on fire</s>
<s>on september 12th mr hashimoto the 43yearold cando mayor of osaka formally launched his national party</s>
<s>its name nihon ishin no kai the japan restoration party or jrp reflects mr hashimoto’s promise to sweep away the existing political order</s>
<s>a general election will soon be called</s>
<s>polling gives his insurrection more support than the ruling party</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>needed fresh heir</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr hashimoto’s arrival on a dismal political scene is welcome</s>
<s>japan’s political establishment is incapable of leadership</s>
<s>the ruling democratic party of japan dpj is consumed by infighting and defections</s>
<s>the conservative liberal democratic party ldp which the dpj ousted in 2009 is grey and cynical</s>
<s>it controls the upper house from where it practises brutish obstructionism</s>
<s>the resulting gridlock and drift ill serves japan</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the country is beset by high government debts a rapidly ageing population and an uncertain future for the young</s>
<s>and so both the style and content of mr hashimoto’s message are welcome</s>
<s>the mayor’s talent for political theatre evokes memories of junichiro koizumi the maverick prime minister from 2001 to 2006</s>
<s>like mr koizumi mr hashimoto preaches a gospel of deregulation</s>
<s>mr koizumi was from the establishment but mr hashimoto is a true outsider see article</s>
<s>in today’s japan that counts for something</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he rose to prominence in osaka by promising to cut through the bureaucracy</s>
<s>he empowered parents by giving them vouchers for their children’s education</s>
<s>nationally he combines these ideas with proposals for radical decentralisation through the creation of germanstyle länder</s>
<s>he wants to halve the number sitting in the lower house of the diet while abolishing an excessively powerful upper house</s>
<s>he wants the prime minister to be directly elected and endowed with strong powers</s>
<s>and he wants to rewrite japan’s pacifist constitution to allow for the right to collective selfdefence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>two caveats accompany the hashimoto phenomenon</s>
<s>the first is his rightwing populism</s>
<s>he is prone to denying the cruel excesses of japan’s imperial past</s>
<s>this is a shortsighted even dangerous provocation at a time of rising nationalism in the region fuelled by maritime disputes between japan china see article and south korea over specks of rock</s>
<s>such jingoism is also selfdefeating</s>
<s>south korea ought to be japan’s ally in arrangements for collective selfdefence yet relations have hit a lowpoint</s>
<s>north korea must be laughing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the second caveat is that far from being the solution to a fragmenting political system at the next general election the jrp’s arrival will be part of the problem</s>
<s>the party intends to field about 300 candidates and may win 3070 seats</s>
<s>mr hashimoto himself will not run this time saying he wants to sort out osaka first</s>
<s> probably the ldp will win a plurality of seats and its next leader perhaps nobuteru ishihara will hope to bring the jra into a coalition</s>
<s>yet the jrp’s freshmen will all be green and with skeletons not yet out of the cupboard scandalprone</s>
<s>the coalition will be fractious and pushing through a hashimoto programme will prove a very tall order</s>
<s>continued gridlock is likely kneejerk jingoism the popular default</s>
<s>it will take at least one more election cycle and maybe two before a broken system can begin to mend</s>
