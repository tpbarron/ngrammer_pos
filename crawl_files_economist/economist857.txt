<p>
<s>many countries have sought to create their own versions of silicon valley</s>
<s>nearly all have failed</s>
<s>yet chile’s attempt is interesting because it exploits the original silicon valley’s weak spot—america’s awful immigration system</s>

<s>“startup chile” is the brainchild of nicolas shea a chilean businessman who had a brief stint in government</s>

<s>has it raised chile’s profile abroad as a hub for enterprise</s>
<s>and has it inspired chileans to start their own businesses</s>
</p>

<p>
