<s>in the year ahead chinas leaders will revel in the growth their country enjoys and the envy this arouses elsewhere especially the west</s>
<s>the world expo which begins in shanghai in may will help to display the brash futuristic face of a country determined to prove that china is the exception to global malaise</s>
<s>but president hu jintao will still be worrying</s>
<s>chinas economy remains troubled and the worst ethnic unrest in many years is proving hard to tame</s>

<p>
<s>chinas economic growth may be stronger than many other countries but it is weaker than before the crisis began</s>
<s>rebalancing the economy to depend less on the battered export sector and more on domestic consumption will take years</s>
<s>massive stimulus spending cannot be sustained indefinitely</s>
<s>as mr hu prepares to step down as communist party chief in 2012 and president in 2013 china faces a far more unsettled economic environment than it did when he assumed those roles a decade earlier</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such concerns will not be evident at the world expo which china describes as an “economic olympics”</s>
<s>as it did in the olympic games in beijing in 2008 china sees this event as a huge milestone on its journey to greatpower status it casts its eye back to the first such event in london in 1851 the great exhibition as it was called with its purposebuilt crystal palace and to the one in paris for which the eiffel tower was built in 1889</s>

<p>
<s>comparisons with the glory days of the wests industrial rise will be well received by the many chinese who see the western worlds current economic distress as an opportunity to shift the balance of global power towards china</s>
<s>but chinas leaders will refrain from overegging the significance of the countrys rise</s>
<s>a stable relationship with america remains of vital importance to mr hu notwithstanding his continuing eagerness to build up chinas military strength 2010 could be the year when chinas first aircraft carrier is unveiled</s>
<s>the coming year will see his government trying at least to appear to be working with america to address the worlds problems from economic distress to climate change</s>

<p>
<s>china will commit itself to few if any sacrifices to curb its greenhousegas emissions</s>
<s>but it will not want to be seen as a pariah following the international climatechange talks in copenhagen in december 2009</s>
<s>it will talk of reducing its carbon intensity the amount of carbon emitted per unit of gdp and of a date well beyond mr hus political horizon when it aims not promises to reach a peak in its carbon emissions</s>
<s>it will make bigger commitments to boost the share of renewable sources in its energy consumption</s>
<s>its talk will be calibrated to give president barack obama the political cover needed to push his climatechange agenda at home</s>
<s>but anything more will require american money and technology</s>
<s>chinese government frustration will grow if these are not forthcoming</s>
<s>talk of cooperation could give way to bickering</s>

<s>in 2010 the government will formulate a new fiveyear economic plan to take effect in the following year</s>
<s>when the communist party meets in the autumn to give its views or to be more precise issue instructions on this much attention will be focused on what it decrees for chinas environment</s>
<s>officials have suggested that carbonintensity targets should be written into the plan</s>
<s>this would be a first for china</s>
<s>but the plan will as always give priority to gdp growth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr hu does not have to worry about meeting the current plans targets</s>
<s>it called for gdp to reach 261 trillion yuan $38 trillion by 2010</s>
<s>that level was surpassed in 2008</s>
<s>another goal was to double gdp per head from its level in 2000</s>
<s>this happened within the plans first couple of years</s>
<s>a revision of chinas perhead data however could well be required after a national census on november 1st 2010 the countrys first in ten years</s>
<s>the likelihood is that chinas population is several tens of millions bigger than officials have been estimating</s>

<p>
<s>the census operation will be supervised by li keqiang a deputy prime minister who is widely expected to be appointed the countrys next prime minister replacing wen jiabao in 2013</s>
<s>vicepresident xi jinping looks on course to take over from mr hu as party chief and president</s>

<p>
<s>mr hu will worry about his legacy</s>
<s>despite rapid economic growth in the ethnicminority regions of tibet and xinjiang these areas have been roiled by unrest since a flareup of rioting in the tibetan capital lhasa in 2008</s>
<s>security deployments and widespread arrests have maintained control but in july 2009 far bloodier rioting erupted in xinjiangs capital urumqi</s>
<s>the authorities fear that a relaxation of security measures could end in more violence</s>
<s>october 2010 will mark the 60th anniversary of chinas invasion of tibet</s>
<s>mr hu will not be able to let down his guard</s>
