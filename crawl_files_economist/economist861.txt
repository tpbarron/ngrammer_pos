<s>it was designed to rescue spain and as a result the euro</s>
<s>so why has the government in madrid not immediately jumped into the life raft built by mario draghi the president of the european central bank with his bondbuying plan</s>
<s>the answer has a name mariano rajoy the country’s studiously enigmatic prime minister</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first mr rajoy continues to pretend that spain might not need a bailout</s>
<s>“before taking a decision we must see whether it is really necessary” he said recently</s>
<s>few spaniards are fooled</s>
<s>mr draghi’s announcement has pushed bond yields to levels lower than when mr rajoy’s centreright people’s party won power in november</s>
<s>but that will not hold for ever</s>
<s>spain’s economic mess—a combination of ailing banks doubledip recession and 25 unemployment—is getting worse</s>
<s>mr rajoy’s labour and other reforms may eventually help but in the meantime the patient needs an emergency infusion</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second mr rajoy knows that spaniards will find the tutelage humiliating</s>
<s>polls show his government losing a third of its support in just six months</s>
<s>in greece ireland and portugal bailedout governments were quickly ejected</s>
<s>this explains why mr rajoy’s government—despite a solid parliamentary majority and four more years in power—does not dare to use the bword</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>third mr rajoy claims that spain does not need to be told what to do</s>
<s>he insists his government will manage to cut a budget deficit that hit 89 of gdp last year</s>
<s>and this he tells spaniards who have already seen €90 billion $116 billion of belttightening spread over several years is because he himself believes in it—and not because heavyweights in brussels or frankfurt demand it</s>
<s>he will have a chance to prove this commitment on september 27th when the budget for 2013 will be unveiled</s>
<s>to meet a 45 deficit target set by the eu his government will have to find further savings or additional revenue of at least €20 billion</s>
<s>a further difficulty is that catalonia’s demand for a revenue rebate has become harder to ignore this week hundreds of thousands rallied in barcelona to demand independence</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr rajoy has already cut spending to the bone and increased taxes</s>
<s>so what is left</s>
<s>he has promised not to cut pensions although they might have to be frozen making pensioners lose in real terms as inflation and taxes eat into purchasing power</s>
<s>hikes in green and capitalgains taxes are also in the offing</s>
<s>portugal which on september 7th decided to raise individuals’ contributions towards social security has shown another avenue for increasing revenues</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>nothing changes the fact that spain is bound for a bailout</s>
<s>what will its rescuers demand</s>
<s>not much more than spain has already signed up to according to olli rehn the european commissioner for economic affairs</s>
<s>but the sequence of events matters</s>
<s>whereas mr rajoy insists on being told the conditions first mr rehn says a country must ask for help before these are worked out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the biggest question concerns timing</s>
<s>opponents accuse the prime minister of trying to delay the bailout until after elections in galicia on october 21st</s>
<s>it may however come far sooner</s>
<s>much depends on what eurozone finance ministers say at their meeting on september 14th</s>
<s>the inscrutable mr rajoy will keep everyone guessing until the end</s>
