<s>to wags during the cold war ground zero was a favoured spot better to be incinerated in the first mushroom cloud they joshed than to wake up to a world of radioactive rubble</s>
<s>but “getting to zero” is suddenly a dream not a nightmare</s>
<s>everyone from americas barack obama to iran is officially signed up for a world free of nuclear weapons</s>
<s>yet if by the end of 2010 iran and north korea are continuing to defy the world with their nuclear programmes the nuclearfree dream will look like a passing fantasy</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the coming year russia and america will make deeper cuts in their nuclear arsenals</s>
<s>mr obama reversing george bushs position will press for senate ratification of a global test ban</s>
<s>in may the 189 countries that have signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt will gather as they do every five years to debate strengthening its rules</s>
<s>just before they meet america will organise a smaller 35nation summit to find new ways of locking down the most dangerous nuclear materials and minimising their use in civilian nuclear programmes</s>
<s>meanwhile the 65member un conference on disarmament in geneva where the testban was first negotiated will be grappling with a new treaty to end the production of fissile material meaning highly enriched uranium and plutonium for bombmaking</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr obama has made “getting to zero” an organising principle of his foreign policy to global applause</s>
<s>oddly brazil egypt south africa and other countries that have long claimed leadership of the worlds disarmament camp may prove the least helpful to his cause</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first the nuclear numbers</s>
<s>overall these will go on tumbling</s>
<s>yet as russia and america aim ever lower to 1000 or fewer strategic nuclear warheads apiece pressure will build for the other three recognised nuclear powers—britain france and china—to put their smaller arsenals on the negotiating table too</s>
<s>but fiveway talks are harder than bilateral ones and china and france will be unenthusiastic</s>
<s>and what to do about the unofficial weapons caches of israel india pakistan and it claims north korea</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so beyond a point weapons cuts will slow</s>
<s>that will annoy the disarmament crowd</s>
<s>so will pressure from mr obamas opponents in congress for more modern warheads so as to be sure of americas shrinking stockpile</s>
<s>in cashstrapped britain by contrast pressure will build to cut back or drop entirely plans to modernise trident its submarinelaunched nuclearweapons system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as for rewriting nuclear rules some governments will resist using the npt conference to strengthen the badly weakened treaty on the ground that the nuclear powers have still not done enough</s>
<s>north korea once a member wont be there this time it has left the treaty and declared itself a nuclear power</s>
<s>iran which denies nuclear ambitions but refuses full cooperation with inspectors will be—working hard to block progress</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one idea is to require all countries so far the process has been voluntary to sign up to enhanced safeguards known as the additional protocol to replace the more basic ones that came with the 40yearold npt</s>
<s>another is to demand that any country leaving the treaty hand back equipment or materials acquired while a member</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>halflife of a dream</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in theory almost everyone in the treaty except iran and syria another alleged miscreant supports the idea of tightening the rules</s>
<s>in practice brazil has been holding out against the additional protocol on the improbable ground that it could put at risk commercial secrets from its uraniumenrichment programme</s>
<s>egypt says it will accept the protocol only when israel not an npt member gives up its bombs</s>
<s>all this looks like letting iran off the hook</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>fuelmaking technologies in the wrong hands can be abused for bombmaking</s>
<s>but plans to curb their spread will move ahead only slowly if at all</s>
<s>australia canada and south africa all with deposits of natural uranium are reluctant to accept limits on their future rights to enrich it for profit</s>
<s>if they dont budge plans for an international fuel bank of last resort to help dissuade countries going for nuclear power from thinking they need proliferationprone uraniumenrichment and plutoniummaking capacities too are likely to fail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even the test ban and a new treaty to cut off production of fissile material—both obvious first steps to a nuclearfree future—will be dogged with difficulty</s>
<s>india seeing china as its chief nuclear rival will refuse to swear off nuclear tests and will go on building up its arsenal and pakistan wont sign up unless india does</s>
<s>when it comes to a fissilematerial ban footdragging roles are reversed with pakistan the chief holdout saving india the bother</s>
<s>that is because new trade arrangements under a controversial civil nuclear deal with america will allow india to devote more of its scarce domestic uranium to its military programme</s>
<s>pakistan with chinas help is determined to keep up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so there will be lots of disarmament talk in 2010</s>
<s>but not a whole lot will get done</s>
