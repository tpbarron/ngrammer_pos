<s>hurricane sandy smashed into a presidential race that was about as close as it could be</s>
<s>according to a constantly updated pollofpolls published by the invaluable political website realclearpolitics the challenger mitt romney is now roughly tied with barack obama in the popular vote</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that tie though is essentially irrelevant thanks to the electoral college that allocates each state a number of votes in proportion to its size and with two tiny exceptions gives all of them to the candidate who wins most support there</s>
<s>as always therefore the battle has boiled down to just a few swing states</s>
<s>what is different this time is the narrowness of the margins in them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr obama it is now clear will not win any state he did not win in 2008 and is instead fighting hard to hold on to the gains he made then</s>
<s>some states have been beyond his reach from the outset indiana which rather improbably went democratic in 2008 has never featured on anyone’s list of possible swing states this time round</s>
<s>and north carolina another longtime republican state that mr obama managed to turn in 2008 has never really looked winnable for the president this time though for just a few days in late september he did move fractionally ahead there</s>
<s>it is still technically a swing state meaning that the average polling margin is less than 5 but even though the democrats went to the trouble of holding their party convention there no one now expects the president to take it</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in order to secure the presidency a candidate needs to win 270 of the electoral college’s 538 votes</s>
<s>states “worth” 201 votes can uncontroversially be assumed to go to mr obama including such huge stalwarts as california and new york and tiny ones such as delaware and rhode island</s>
<s>for mr romney states worth 191 votes between them are similarly locked up</s>
<s>the west coast and the northeast are solid for mr obama while the south and the great plains are solid for mr romney with two important exceptions in virginia and florida</s>
<s>that leaves a rather large number of electoral college votes—146 by rcp’s reckoning—still up in the air</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if mr romney is to win that vote as distinct from the popular one he needs somehow to get from 191 to 270</s>
<s>that is not quite as daunting as it sounds</s>
<s>in florida he has consistently led the polls since immediately after the first presidential debate on october 3rd in which the president performed so badly</s>
<s>more to the point all the signs are that the president has given up on the state investing neither time nor much money there</s>
<s>florida suffered worse than almost any other state in the recession and the recovery has been particularly weak</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so it is not unreasonable to assume that florida with its 29 votes as well as north carolina with its 15 now sit in the republican camp</s>
<s>similarly pennsylvania with 20 though ever on the republican wishlist does not seem minded to move out of the democratic camp this time round although it too remains a close race</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>add florida and north carolina to the 191 solid romney votes and he has 235</s>
<s>to win another 35 votes are still needed</s>
<s>where might he get them</s>
<s>two obvious possibilities lie thousands of miles apart in colorado in the mountain west and in virginia the other remarkable upset that mr obama pulled off in 2008 by winning a state that the republicans had held since 1968</s>
<s>at the moment both states are in a tie according to rcp’s rolling average</s>
<s>mr romney had a wildly successful rally in liberal denver last week though suggesting that he might in fact take colorado</s>
<s>virginia is still anyone’s guess</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but even if mr romney adds colorado nine votes and virginia 13 votes to his probable haul he still ends up with only 257—a tantalising 13 votes short</s>
<s>nevada six votes is we think out of reach for him too many latinos vote there</s>
<s>new hampshire four votes and iowa six votes are too small to help much and mr romney is trailing in both though in iowa he has a chance all four of the state’s main newspapers have endorsed him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>which brings us as with all recent elections to the midwest</s>
<s>if mr romney could secure ohio with its 18 votes he would have the election in the bag</s>
<s>but his momentum there may have stalled leaving him a couple of points shy of victory</s>
<s>both contenders have spent more time there than anywhere else neither seems to have acquired any momentum</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr romney does have a couple of other midwestern options</s>
<s>he could win in wisconsin the home of his runningmate paul ryan</s>
<s>the polls have been shifting in his favour since the first debate but he is still trailing by a couple of points</s>
<s>and wisconsin carries only ten votes so he would still need to pick up one other state</s>
<s>either iowa or new hampshire would do it if it were new hampshire he would win the electoral college by a breathless 271267</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is however a last possibility if only a long shot</s>
<s>this week’s most intriguing news is that michigan mr romney’s native state but long thought to be solidly democratic is also on the move</s>
<s>a poll in the detroit news had mr obama’s lead despite the car industry bailout down to just 27 from 67 a month ago</s>
<s>if michigan is really in play november 6th will be a very long night</s>
