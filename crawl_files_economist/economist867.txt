<s>hardly a week goes by without an announcement of a big lawsuit against a bank in america</s>
<s>wells fargo was this week’s target the department of justice sued the bank for allegedly dodgy lending among other things</s>
<s>last week it was jpmorgan chase’s turn as new york’s attorneygeneral took aim at practices at bear stearns a crisisera acquisition</s>
<s>foreign banks have also been hit hsbc standard chartered and barclays have all been on the end of highprofile charges recently</s>
<s>considering the banks’ role in america’s worst recession since the depression this is hardly surprising</s>
<s>but the deluge of litigation has got out of hand</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first america’s overlapping layers of regulators and litigators—state federal and contingencyfeefinanced civil action—have all expanded</s>
<s>so banks face a prosecutorial maze</s>
<s>they can find themselves under investigation by several different offices of the same federal agency while grappling with other federal departments state ones and classaction lawsuits</s>
<s>in theory overlaps should be minimised by the deference government entities grant to one another in the name of efficiency</s>
<s>in practice numerous entities now descend on financial institutions if only to demand reams of documents</s>
<s>wells receives about 5000 legal orders a week and has two centres one on each coast devoted to processing them—and its legal costs are lower than most</s>
<s>double jeopardy does not apply to the banks the end of an investigation by one agency does not mean an end to scrutiny by others</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>second lawsuits and investigations too often end up looking like a shakedown</s>
<s>because of the sheer volume of cases and because banks believe there is often little choice but to cut a deal the outcome is far likelier to be a settlement than a determination of guilt in a courtroom</s>
<s>during fiscal year 2011 the securities and exchange commission collected $414m in fines from big financial institutions and settlements in classaction lawsuits reached $15 billion during the corresponding calendar year</s>
<s>these murky resolutions make it impossible to know if banks are being wrongly attacked or their injustices are being wrongly buried see article</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this damages the banks the justice system and america as a whole</s>
<s>a healthy financial system is not one that collects money from investors at one end and pays a big chunk of it out at the other end to lawyers in fees and to the government in fines</s>
<s>this mess therefore needs to be brought under control</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>divide and rule</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one step would be to introduce a far clearer divide between federal and state systems of regulation</s>
<s>national issues international moneylaundering terrorist finance tax matters should be supervised in washington dc</s>
<s>responsibility for consumer protection which is inevitably tied to local tradeoffs more properly belongs with the states</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>regulators should not be in the business of extracting cash from banks in behindthescenes settlements</s>
<s>such deals are a nice little earner for regulators—too nice because banks are always in a rush to settle so regulators are rarely required to prove their case in court</s>
<s>the danger of losing in an open trial might discourage regulators from pursuing weak cases</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such an approach will carry costs of its own</s>
<s>reducing competition between different agencies for instance may allow banks and regulators to get too cosy</s>
<s>protecting consumers at state level would create a patchwork across the country making life harder for nationwide institutions</s>
<s>court cases might be costlier than settlements</s>
<s>even so it’s worth the price</s>
<s>america needs a way out of its legal labyrinth</s>
