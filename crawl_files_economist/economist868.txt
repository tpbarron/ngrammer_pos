<s>homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in china a decade ago but prejudice remains deep</s>
<s>so when an editor at the government education department in the city of hangzhou was compiling a pamphlet recently to help parents guide their children through puberty she included a warning about “deviant” behaviour</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what she may not have expected was an irate open letter in response from a group of mothers of gay children</s>
<s>eighteen mothers from all over china affiliated with parents families and friends of lesbians and gays an ngo known as pflag china signed the letter</s>
<s>it called for the book to be withdrawn</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“we’re extremely angry about this” one of the signatories says who asked only to be identified by her internet name romantic mum from hebei</s>
<s>“understanding and accepting gay people starts with education” she continues</s>
<s>“but if kids continue to get this kind of education the prejudice will remain”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the mother says her own “unsuitable education” meant that she was devastated when her son came out to her at the age of 15 “i kept asking myself what i had done wrong in bringing him up” but last year after joining some online discussion groups she accepted that her son was not going to change</s>
<s>now she helps run pflag’s hotline which offers advice to parents of gay children</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pflag’s director hu zhijun says that ten years ago very few children came out to their parents</s>
<s>now with more information available online a new generation of gay people are more confident</s>
<s>“they’re more likely to tell their parents and classmates” he says</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the government editor’s response was encouraging too she invited the volunteers for a chat apologised for not knowing much about gay people and said there will be changes in the next edition of the book</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but there is much more to do says romantic mum</s>
<s>her parents and close friends have been surprisingly accepting of her son’s homosexuality but the boy’s father has not and now barely talks to him</s>
<s>and although mr hu and his group have recently given talks in universities schools are more resistant</s>
<s>he estimates that perhaps 10 of gay people in china now tell their parents</s>
<s>most of the rest still feel they must get married to satisfy their families</s>
