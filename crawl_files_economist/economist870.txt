<s>this could be the end of the road for big pharmas failed business model</s>
<s>in recent years the worlds innovative drug giants have seen research productivity plummet even as the costs of research have soared</s>
<s>share prices have taken a beating as the industry has failed to come up with enough promising blockbuster drugs to compensate for the revenue lost when old moneyspinners lose their patent protection</s>
<s>even the recent round of mergers and acquisitions instigated by large firms such as pfizer and merck followed by the requisite costcutting and sackings has failed to fix what ails the industry</s>

<p>
<s>the heart of the problem is the looming patent “cliff” see chart</s>
<s>evaluatepharma a consultancy estimates that 13 of global pharmaceutical sales are at risk from generic competition in the coming two years</s>
<s>this matters because the price of a given drug falls by more than 85 within a year of patent expiry in competitive markets like the united states</s>
<s>over the next year company bosses had better come up with improved business models or else they will drive their firms right off that precipice</s>

<p>
<s>and yet the industrys salvation could very well lie in the embrace of that very same nemesis—generic drugs</s>
<s>the coming year will bring dramatic moves by big pharma to learn from copy and even get into bed with the rivals it once decried as copycats and scofflaws</s>
<s>the explanation for this startling turn of events is twofold in the rich world generic drugs are advancing as a result of government action whereas in the developing world it is the booming middle class that is propelling them forward</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>first the developed world</s>
<s>in 2010 rich countries will boost the fortunes of generic drugs in two ways</s>
<s>in many such countries from japan to germany governments struggling to control health costs will introduce policies that favour the use of cheap generic drugs</s>
<s>the american precedent suggests this will be a powerful trend</s>
<s>from 1999 to 2008 the use of generic drugs saved america some $734 billion</s>
<s>and the boom is set to continue with the american generics sector forecast to grow by over 9 a year to 2012</s>

<p>
<s>but carrots will soon be accompanied by sticks</s>
<s>regulators at americas federal trade commission and at the european commission have already expressed their displeasure at perceived antitrust violations involving big pharmas efforts to thwart competition from generics through for example “pay for delay” deals that bribe rivals to put back the launch of generic pills</s>
<s>the year ahead could well see tough talk turn to regulatory action</s>
<s>this trend too should change attitudes at big firms so that generics are not seen merely as pests to be tolerated or paid off but rather as inspiration for a radically different business model</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is especially true when it comes to the developing world which is where the action is these days</s>
<s>in 2010 much of the revenue growth for the drugs industry overall will come from the leading economies of the poor world</s>
<s>ims health another consultancy calculates that the seven biggest emerging pharma markets made up more than half of the global industrys total sales growth in 2009</s>
<s>by 2012 nine of the top 20 markets will be emerging economies</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the trick to winning over the rising middle classes in such markets is not to peddle overpriced patented drugs on the western model cursing the local generics firms as ripoff artists</s>
<s>big pharma has tried that route for years with little success</s>
<s>rather the key is to pitch branded generic drugs</s>
<s>these are offpatent pills and potions that can be sold more cheaply than the onpatent variety but which still command an attractive price premium in poor countries due to the proliferation in local markets of fakes and drugs of dubious quality</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in 2010 the big western drugs firms will enter the branded generics markets in full force by joining up with local generics firms to get cheap access to this booming niche</s>
<s>a few pioneers have already headed down this path</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some like americas pfizer have experimented with licensing deals and alliances with asian generics firms</s>
<s>others have gone a bit further as britains glaxosmithkline did with its recent acquisition of a share in aspen an african firm specialising in branded generics</s>
<s>yet others go the full monty as japans daiichi sankyo did by gobbling up indias ranbaxy laboratories</s>
<s>watch for a dramatic acceleration of this trend in the coming year—which could even lead to the end of the independent generics industry in india</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>taken together these trends point to 2010 being a turningpoint for the global generics business</s>
<s>big pharma is in big trouble but it may yet find comfort in the arms of that erstwhile foe</s>
