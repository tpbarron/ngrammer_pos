<s>for two days last week lexington became a member of the motoring press corps of texas testdriving fullsized ie huge pickup trucks around the plains near dallas</s>
<s>though these bullnosed monsters some boasting the horsepower of three london buses were a blast a longerterm career change does not beckon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the texas press busily debated cylinders torque and towing weights</s>
<s>for a nonspecialist the challenge is conveying how extraordinary these vast cars are</s>
<s>bowling along country roads with a ford chief engineer—a highflier who has in her day handled such tasks as tuning mustang exhausts to make them growl right—lexington mumbled noncommittally very impressive</s>
<s>in truth he was thinking this truck feels at once unstoppably powerful yet absurdly easy to drive</s>
<s>it is like a sort of remorseless sofa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thankfully it was the politics of the pickup truck that had brought lexington to dallas and the launch of 2013’s models at the annual state fair of texas</s>
<s>for these trucks matter</s>
<s>the market leaders fseries pickups from ford are not just bestselling trucks</s>
<s>they have been america’s bestselling vehicles for the past 30 years</s>
<s>politicians flaunt pickups as proof that they are regular folk</s>
<s>in a brutal senate race in massachusetts scott brown the republican has made an icon of his general motors truck with 200000 miles on the clock</s>
<s>any product that popular deserves study as much as squabbling politicians on the trail</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what’s more the pickups’ success points to shared american values that barack obama and mitt romney might ponder as their campaigns stress national divisions and disputes</s>
<s>these include exceptionalism egalitarianism and pragmatism</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>start with exceptionalism</s>
<s>fullsized pickups are barely sold outside north america and mexico a handful go to south america and gulf arab states</s>
<s>even in america there are eccentric spots such as washington dc where big pickups are rare beyond a few used by builders or jobbing gardeners</s>
<s>yet at the peak of sales in their home market during the presidency of george w bush a truck fan nearly a million fseries pickups were sold each year many to suburban wannabes the industry calls “nevernevers” meaning they never take trucks offroad or use them for towing</s>
<s>as mr obama took office pickup sales were in free fall</s>
<s>high fuel prices had driven the poseurs from the sector while traditional buyers were crushed by the credit crunch and the implosion of the building industry</s>
<s>now the sector is recovering with fseries sales rising 114 in the year to date</s>
<s>the focus is on the biggest models with the fanciest fittings from saddleleather seats to computers that spot a tornado or hailstorm five miles away</s>
<s>luxury trucks costing $40000 or more account for almost a third of sales of the f150 the most common fseries variant</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the stakes are high</s>
<s>a discreet complex in a dallas suburb houses the office of sam pack owner of four ford dealerships</s>
<s>fseries trucks are the bedrock of sales says mr pack softspoken and dapper in a monogrammed shirt silk tie and crocodileskin shoes</s>
<s>examining a computer printout he puts that in real money he sold $213mworth of big pickups last year out of total revenues of $587m</s>
<s>mr pack is not the largest ford dealer in texas</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the sector is egalitarian</s>
<s>mr pack’s most recent 100 sales were to company owners doctors and lawyers but also to a postman builders and a nurse</s>
<s>many of the priciest were bought by selfemployed contractors precisely because they all but live in their trucks</s>
<s>by week their luxury trucks haul heavy machinery</s>
<s>at the weekend buyers want a pickup that makes them proud as they take their spouse to a restaurant or tow a boat to the lake</s>
<s>in europe notes a detroit executive their equivalent might drive a transit van but would not use that to take a partner to dinner</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>today’s pickups demonstrate pragmatism</s>
<s>that may seem counterintuitive with their big engines and tonkatoy looks trucks suggest a refusal to compromise with fuel prices or fears of global warming</s>
<s>but industry buzz is around the success of a turbocharged sixcylinder ford engine that uses a fifth less fuel than older larger v8 engines of similar power</s>
<s>the new v6 will help ford meet tougher federal fuelefficiency standards but is not being marketed that way</s>
<s>it is sold as a moneysaver</s>
<s>over 200000 have been sold so far though not long ago a truck engine without eight cylinders was doomed in any barstool bragging contest</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>one nation united behind the wheel</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this is the patriotic end of the domestic car market the only one still dominated by big american firms</s>
<s>texan buyers “frequently” tell mr pack’s salesmen that they are buying ford because unlike others the firm did not take a government bailout</s>
<s>these are vehicles bought by hardworking “makers” not the welfaredependent “takers” the romney camp conflates with the democratic base</s>
<s>yet pickups are not only for conservatives</s>
<s>texas is the home of big trucks but the 30 biggest metropolitan markets divide evenly between red and blue states</s>
<s>pickups are wildly popular with hispanics as well as whites</s>
<s>there are makers on both sides of the partisan divide</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what is more republicans run a risk if they bet this election on economic pessimism</s>
<s>big pickups are seen in the car industry as a leading indicator rising sales point to americans starting to build kitchens fix roofs and hire contractors</s>
<s>finally the right should beware scorning environmental concerns as nothing but a malthusian conspiracy</s>
<s>at ford greenery spurred innovation</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the newest pickups suggest different lessons for republicans they arguably offer one big one to mr obama</s>
<s>pickup buyers dislike overt government nagging</s>
<s>they do not feel guilty about driving exceptionally large vehicles</s>
<s>they revere hard work starting with their own</s>
<s>but offer a nifty technological fix packaged right and they will embrace goals such as saving the planet</s>
<s>pragmatism is profitable and profit is a powerful force</s>
