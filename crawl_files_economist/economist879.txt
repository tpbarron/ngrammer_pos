<s>he might be an academic—40 years on the faculty of harvard law school—but roger fisher was really a fixer</s>
<s>he would relax by mending the plumbing or laying brick terraces at the summer house he loved in martha’s vineyard</s>
<s>but that was tiddler stuff</s>
<s>at breakfast he would scan the new york times looking for bigger problems he could fix arms control hostagetaking the middle east</s>
<s>over dinner the conversation would be sorting out vietnam or ending the war in el salvador</s>
<s>at his 80th birthday party most other guests gone he was found deep in a discussion of peace between arabs and israelis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as long as there were disputes in the world and energy in his body he was going to help resolve them</s>
<s>if it needed a letter to a head of state he would send it</s>
<s>if it needed him on the next flight to moscow or tokyo he would catch it</s>
<s>people didn’t have to invite him in</s>
<s>he would go anyway tall slim and smiling and slip into action behind the scenes</s>
<s>with that sunny confidence he always had he knew he could make the world better</s>
<s>and so did others jk galbraith remarked that if he knew mr fisher was on to a problem it always eased his conscience</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr fisher had a system</s>
<s>he outlined it with william ury in his book “getting to yes” 1981 which sold 3m copies he also taught it to students especially from 1979 through his harvard negotiation project</s>
<s>like all good tools it got better with use</s>
<s>in any negotiation he wrote—even with terrorists—it was vital to separate the people from the problem to focus on the underlying interests of both sides rather than stake out unwavering positions and to explore all possible options before making a decision</s>
<s>the parties should try to build a rapport check each other out even just by shaking hands or eating together</s>
<s>each should “listen actively” as he always did to what the other was saying</s>
<s>they should recognise the emotions on either side from a longing for security to a craving for status</s>
<s>and they should try to get inside each other’s heads</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that was the theory and mr fisher delighted to put it into practice</s>
<s>at the geneva summit of 1985 for example ronald reagan on his advice did not confront mikhail gorbachev but sat by a roaring fire with him while they exchanged ideas</s>
<s>more summits followed</s>
<s>a border war between peru and ecuador was nipped in the bud when mr fisher advised the president of ecuador once a pupil of his to sit on a sofa with the peruvian president and look at a map with him</s>
<s>interviewing president nasser of egypt in 1970 mr fisher asked him how golda meir then israel’s prime minister would be regarded at home if she agreed to all his demands</s>
<s>“boy would she have a problem” nasser laughed</s>
<s>he then grew thoughtful having briefly seen their dispute from her point of view</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the middle east which caused him personal grief also brought his most public success</s>
<s>his principles were used all through the camp david negotiations of 1978 from the brainstorming over jimmy carter’s draft of an agreement 23 rewrites to the moment when mr carter presented menachem begin the israeli leader with signed pictures dedicated by name to each of begin’s grandchildren</s>
<s>deeply affected begin began to talk about his family</s>
<s>the accords were signed that day</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he had his failures</s>
<s>as a pentagon adviser in the 1960s he suggested several “yesable propositions” to put to the north vietnamese robert mcnamara listened but not the military brass</s>
<s>in 1967 he had fun trying to nurse the tiny dusty island of anguilla to independent statehood but the experiment was overturned</s>
<s>south africa possibly satisfied him most the afrikaner cabinet and anc officials trained separately by him in negotiation workshops agreeing to end apartheid without resorting to violence</s>

<p>
<s>lessons from the souk</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr fisher’s motivation was as clear as his writing</s>
<s>he hated war</s>
<s>his own service had been as a weather reconnaissance officer in the course of it he had lost his roommate and many college friends</s>
<s>he had also flown often over japan harmless morning flights which the japanese prehiroshima had fatally learned to ignore</s>
<s>all those deaths weighed on him</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>more lightheartedly he grew up as one of six children preferring to strike bargains rather than land a punch</s>
<s>later on still bargainminded he would stroll the souks of damascus or jerusalem looking to expand his collection of ancient weights</s>
<s>every one of those pieces represented a tough negotiation successfully concluded</s>
<s>for those who found his principles too idealistic he could point to ageold haggling tricks he also recommended pretending not to be interested refusing to react to pressure being prepared to walk away</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his most pleasing bargain though was the one he made to get his lot on the vineyard</s>
<s>there he built a glass and shingle house right between the pounding ocean and watcha pond where ospreys nested</s>
<s>when he first found the place the owner refused to part with the few acres he needed</s>
<s>he would sell him only the whole property 60 acres or so which cost too much</s>
<s>but mr fisher called in friends they all clubbed together the deal was agreed and he spent 50 glorious summers there in just the sort of sweet wise negotiated peace he always wished for the world</s>
