<s>somebody must have put on the wrong film</s>
<s>in late july mario draghi president of the european central bank came out looking like a tough sheriff ready to take on bondmarket speculators while others cringed</s>
<s>the euro was irreversible he declared</s>
<s>“the ecb is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro</s>
<s>and believe me it will be enough”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet instead of a great shootout mr draghi later said he was mulling only a limited holding action</s>
<s>and now he has ducked out of sight cancelling his appearance in cowboy country this weekend at the annual gettogether of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming</s>
<s>gary cooper would never have cried off because of his “heavy workload”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with the power to create money mr draghi owns the biggest gun of all</s>
<s>merely the hint that he is prepared to use it to buy bonds has had a reassuring effect averting any panic over the summer</s>
<s>investors are now waiting to see what he will do when the ecb’s governing council meets on september 6th</s>
<s>perhaps supermario needs time to saddle up</s>
<s>but there is a more worrying possibility that mr draghi is slugging it out with deputies trying to keep the guncloset locked</s>
<s>jens weidmann president of germany’s bundesbank says intervening in the bond market comes dangerously close to breaking the law that bans the ecb from financing states</s>
<s>governments created the crisis and governments should resolve it argues mr weidmann</s>
<s>if they become reliant on the ecb’s power they will never do anything for themselves ecb money he suggests “can become addictive like a drug”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr weidmann’s challenge is polarising views in germany</s>
<s>many worry that the euro will turn into a soft currency area with high inflation—rather like mr draghi’s native italy in the days of the lira</s>
<s>alexander dobrindt general secretary of bavaria’s christian social union part of germany’s ruling coalition says the ecb risks becoming “the currency forger of europe”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>to a greater extent than outsiders might think mr draghi shares mr weidmann’s concerns</s>
<s>the word from frankfurt is that because he has run italy’s treasury and its central bank mr draghi knows more than most how monetary financing of deficits can lead to high inflation</s>
<s>he also knows that past bondbuying by the ecb had no lasting impact and loaded the ecb with dubious bonds</s>
<s>but to him this means that the weapon should be used with care not banned entirely</s>
<s>in early august mr draghi said the ecb was prepared to resume bondbuying under strict conditions</s>
<s>first countries seeking help should make a formal request to the temporary european financial stability facility or the planned permanent european stability mechanism</s>
<s>second they should commit to reforms</s>
<s>and third the rescue funds should buy longdated bonds in the primary market to bring down borrowing costs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>only then if needed might the ecb deploy its firepower to buy shortdated debt in the secondary market</s>
<s>action at the short end mr draghi argued was closer to conventional monetary policy</s>
<s>this is a narrower front than the one chosen by his predecessor jeanclaude trichet but mr draghi thinks he can deliver more firepower</s>
<s>he said the scale of intervention would be “adequate”</s>
<s>and he also promised to address investors’ fears that ecb purchases would have the effect of subordinating private bondholders</s>
<s>he can surely get his way mighty germany wields the same voting power in the ecb as tiny malta</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the real question is the extent to which mr weidmann has the support of the german government</s>
<s>there is talk of berlin’s irritation with the bundesbank’s fundamentalism</s>
<s>tellingly the other german on the ecb council jörg asmussen endorses mr draghi’s view that the ecb should intervene to assuage fears that the euro will break up</s>
<s>the drama is heightened by the fact that mr weidmann was until last year angela merkel’s loyal economic adviser</s>
<s>yet even if the chancellor sees him as her turbulent thomas becket she is careful not to seem to want rid of him</s>
<s>mrs merkel may well tacitly support mr draghi</s>
<s>after all say senior eurocrats it is easier to get the ecb to prop up countries than to ask the bundestag for more bailout money or eurobonds</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>frankfurt v the capitals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>indeed many see the ecb as the euro’s ultimate saviour</s>
<s>it has the independence and means to act decisively</s>
<s>as a guardian of the euro it sees the european interest better than national politicians and central banks</s>
<s>and it has a strong incentive to act without the euro there would be no ecb</s>
<s>but this is too simple a view</s>
<s>the ecb must always perform a balancing act between its power to print money and its unusually narrow legal mandate between its independence and the need to maintain political consent</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>by placing governments in the front line mr draghi seeks to avoid moral hazard of two sorts</s>
<s>one is the risk that debtors will abandon reforms as soon as market pressure is relaxed as happened with italy under silvio berlusconi last summer</s>
<s>instead of writing secret letters the ecb wants other european bodies overtly to enforce fiscal and structural reforms</s>
<s>the other unspoken danger is that without a fear of the euro’s collapse creditors will shirk action to solidify the euro through greater economic financial fiscal and political integration and risksharing</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the euro’s crisis is fundamentally political not monetary or financial</s>
<s>the ecb cannot fix the euro it can only buy time</s>
<s>in many ways mr weidmann is right to say that if there is to be mutualisation of risk it should not be done through the back door of the ecb but rather through the front door eg with eurobonds and with the agreement of national parliaments</s>
<s>some in the ecb think that the crisis will have to worsen before politicians take such radical action</s>
<s>either because he cannot or because he does not want to mr draghi will not be the lone ranger</s>
