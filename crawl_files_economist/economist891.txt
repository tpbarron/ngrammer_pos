<s>when he was at the treasury nearly 20 years ago larry summers would counsel president bill clinton on the merits of “stimulative austerity” cut deficits and interest rates will fall by enough to produce stronger economic growth</s>
<s>now mr summers is making the opposite case stimulate growth through a bigger deficit and the longterm debt may shrink</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a new paper written with brad delong of the university of california berkeley mr summers now at harvard after a stint as barack obamas chief economic adviser says that in the odd circumstances america faces today temporary stimulus “may actually be selffinancing”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this sort of argument is not new</s>
<s>advisers to john kennedy and lyndon johnson thought their 1964 tax cut might stimulate so much new spending it would pay for itself</s>
<s>in the early 1980s supplyside economists argued something similar about ronald reagans tax cuts</s>
<s>neither claim stood the test of time</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr delong and mr summers are careful to say stimulus almost never pays for itself</s>
<s>when the economy is near full employment deficits crowd out private spending and investment</s>
<s>in a recession the central bank will respond to fiscal stimulus by keeping interest rates higher than they would otherwise be</s>
<s>both effects mean that in normal times the fiscal “multiplier”—the amount by which output rises for each dollar of government spending or tax cuts—is probably close to zero</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>such constraints are not present now</s>
<s>investment and demand are deeply depressed and the central bank having cut interest rates to zero is not about to raise them</s>
<s>the multiplier is higher than usual as a result</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>many economists have made this point</s>
<s>mr delong and mr summers go further by introducing the role of “hysteresis”—the tendency of a temporary change in unemployment to become permanent</s>
<s>mr summers has looked into this topic before</s>
<s>in an early paper he found that the surge in demand for women workers during the second world war permanently raised the presence of women in the workforce a case of positive hysteresis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the worry now is very different</s>
<s>between 3 and 4 of the labour force has been unemployed for at least six months see chart the highest proportion in over 60 years</s>
<s>the longer the economy stays depressed the more likely those workers are to quit the labour force altogether</s>
<s>by putting these people back to work today stimulus generates higher taxes not just this year but for years to come lowering the longterm debt burden</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr delong and mr summers build a model that tests when stimulus is likely to pay for itself</s>
<s>as an example if the multiplier is 1 roughly in the middle of independent estimates for the current stimulus taxes are 33 of gdp and the hysteresis effect is 5—that is a $1 loss of output this year reduces potential output by 5 cents per year—then stimulus pays for itself provided the real interest rate is no more than 25 percentage points above the economic growth rate</s>
<s>those criteria are met today</s>
<s>the real interest rate at around zero is well below the growth rate at 25</s>
<s>although reliable estimates of hysteresis in america are scarce those that mr delong and mr summers present are far higher than 5</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are some shortcomings in their case</s>
<s>concepts such as fiscal multipliers and hysteresis are imprecise</s>
<s>the authors assume increased deficits wont scare investors away from a countrys bonds</s>
<s>and there is the risk that their model is used to justify deficits even when conditions arent right</s>
<s>their conclusions apply “only in circumstances of a kind we havent seen in the us in 70some years and once this episode ends wont see again in more than 70 years” says mr summers</s>
<s>even now “it depends on the ability to do something that may be politically hard keeping the stimulus timely and targeted”</s>
