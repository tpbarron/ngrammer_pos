<s>although there has been no largescale use of chemical weapons since the iraniraq war in the 1980s soldiers need to be prepared for the threat</s>
<s>part of that preparation means being able to decontaminate people and equipment that have been subject to attack</s>

<p>
<s>the suits and masks worn by soldiers can if necessary be thrown away once used but heavier and more expensive equipment such as vehicles cannot be treated in such a cavalier fashion</s>
<s>instead it needs to be cleaned</s>
<s>at the moment that is usually done by sloshing it with a solution of hydrogen peroxide</s>
<s>this works but lugging the stuff around is a nuisance—and so is disposing of it once it has been used</s>
<s>britain’s defence science and technology laboratory working in collaboration with akzonobel a maker of paint and specialty chemicals proposes doing the job with a fancy sort of paint</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as is often the case with paint jobs the new antichemicalweapon paint needs an undercoat and a top coat</s>
<s>the top coat contains silica gel an absorbent material that can suck up nerve gas and stop it getting inside a vehicle</s>
<s>this upper layer is available in standard camouflage colours such as yellow for deserts and green for jungles</s>
<s>the undercoat is made of a polymer that acts like the glue on a postit note</s>
<s>it is in other words sticky enough to hold the top coat in place but can be easily peeled away</s>
<s>if a vehicle gets contaminated its paint can be quickly scraped off and a new top coat applied in its place</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the next stage currently still in the laboratory is to develop coatings that change colour when they absorb toxic chemicals thus alerting soldiers that they are under chemical attack</s>
<s>the details are secret but a system which responds to mustard gas has been devised and others are under development</s>
<s>after that the plan is to produce a coating that not only absorbs noxious chemicals but neutralises them</s>
<s>a group of researchers at the university of vermont led by christopher landry have already managed to combine silica gel with a vanadium catalyst to create a mixture that oxidises mustard gas rendering it harmless</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the future then military paint will not only hide vehicles from prying eyes—it will also help protect soldiers from one of the most feared forms of attack</s>
<s>what wilfred owen called the “ecstasy of fumbling” that follows the cry of “gas” may become a little less panicstricken</s>
