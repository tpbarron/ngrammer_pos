<s>randy newman once wrote a song about rock stars who outstay their welcome entitled “im dead but i dont know it”</s>
<s>it began “i have nothing left to saybut im going to say it anyway” that was in 1999</s>
<s>what seemed like satire has become accurate prediction</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>thirteen years on the old rockers are nearly all still rocking</s>
<s>in 2012 sir paul mccartney who is still finding new places to go and sing “oh i believe in yesterday” will be 70</s>
<s>so will brian wilson of the beach boys whose lavish gifts as a melodist arranger and captor of the zeitgeist made him the closest american match for sir paul</s>
<s>mr wilson is doddery now but still performing propped up by a crack ninepiece band</s>
<s>also turning 70 in 2012 are aretha franklin who unfurls her majestic soul voice occasionally and lou reed and john cale who more or less invented art rock with the velvet underground in 1967 and are both still trying new things—in mr reeds case a perplexing collaboration with the heavymetal band metallica</s>

<p>
<s>three great songwriters who turned 70 in 2011 are still working at close to full throttle bob dylan paul simon and neil diamond</s>
<s>and one of the most mouthwatering records of 2012 will come from an even older stager leonard cohen 77 whose first album of new songs since 2004 is due in the spring</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr cohen apart these colossi were all born in 1941 or 1942</s>
<s>this is not just a coincidence</s>
<s>when rocknroll exploded across the world in the mid1950s they were 14 or 15 about the most impressionable age there is</s>
<s>and by the time they reached the top in the mid1960s the popular song was going through its purplest and most innovative patch so their talents bounced off each other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that in turn is one reason why they have proved durable</s>
<s>to hear “hey jude” or “like a rolling stone” sung by its author albeit croakily is to catch a whiff of a golden age</s>
<s>and these songs belong to all agegroups now</s>
<s>a generation who went to rock concerts partly to get away from their parents now happily turn up with their children</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>what their idols have been less good at is continuing to capture the moment</s>
<s>the last recognised classic to flow from their pens was “make you feel my love” released by mr dylan in 1997 and popularised lately by adele a british singer young enough to be his girlfriend</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>old age should be fertile ground for popular music but only the late johnny cash in his blazing indian summer from 1994 to 2003 has really proved it</s>
<s>mr  cohen has touched on ageing notably in 1988 when he sang “now my friends have gone and my hair is grey i ache in the places where i used to play” his new album is called “old ideas” which bodes well</s>
<s>it will be his biggest seller in 40 years</s>
<s>he is unique among these elders in having peaked in his dotage his world tour of 200810 undertaken to make up for $5m stolen by a crooked manager was a roaring commercial and critical success</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rock is now aligning itself with jazz blues and easy listening whose exponents bop till they drop tony bennett returned to the charts in september at 85</s>
<s>in 2012 it will be 50 years since mr dylans first album the beatles first single and the rolling stones first gig</s>
<s>but sir mick jagger and keith richards who will turn 69 in 2012 surely have one last tour in them if only because they are deeply competitive and their record gross has just been pipped by u2</s>
<s>mr richards is a great guitarist a skill that does not fade away</s>
<s>and sir mick pictured still passes the litmus test set by another veteran singer suzi quatro who was recently asked how long she would go on performing</s>
<s>“when i turn my back on the audience and shake my ass and there is ­silence” she said “i will stop”</s>
