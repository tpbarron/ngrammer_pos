<s>so much value in a confined space makes insurers nervous</s>
<s>“the concentration of risk in just a few facilities is what really troubles us as an industry” says robert read at hiscox a specialist art insurer</s>
<s>just how concentrated that risk was became clearer after a 2009 change in swiss customs law that required collectors to detail the contents of their storage lockers</s>
<s>according to adam prideaux a broker at blackwall green collectors could previously move their works into a warehouse without telling their insurers</s>
<s>“you could have a $100m collection in a unit next to a $200m collection and that would mean insurers didn’t realise they had $300m of liability within 30 metres of each other”</s>

<s>the soaring prices being paid for art exacerbate the risk as clients update their policies to reflect current values and some insurers pay claims on a market value to be determined by arbitration</s>
<s>the $120m paid for edvard munch’s “the scream” in may set a new record for works at auction but private placements can be even more lucrative qatar’s royal family paid $250m for a version of paul cezanne’s “card players” this year</s>

<s>many insurers no longer issue blanket coverage for a piece without knowing whether it is on display in storage or being transported</s>
<s>in response a few collectors have moved their works to smaller swiss free ports or to a massive new one next to singapore’s changi airport</s>
<s>new free ports are being built in luxembourg and beijing and planning is said to be under way for one in monaco</s>
<s>art lovers are benefiting too</s>
<s>some owners have moved collections out of storage to be displayed at home or in museums</s>
