<s>when hundreds of freshly minted members of parliament arrived in the capital naypyidaw in january 2011 to take up their seats in the gaudy new parliament building nobody took them very seriously</s>
<s>the main opposition party the national league for democracy nld had boycotted the general election the previous october</s>
<s>at the time their leader aung san suu kyi remained under house arrest and the election was heavily rigged in favour of the proxy party of the country’s generals the union solidarity and development party usdp</s>
<s>so the majority who took up seats were military mps a quarter of whom were directly appointed by the generals</s>
<s>surely this was going to be more of an echo chamber than a debating one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at first that was true</s>
<s>the few nonmilitary mps mainly from minority ethnic parties struggled just to be heard let alone hold ministers to account</s>
<s>now however all that is changing</s>
<s>indeed in the political transformation of myanmar that continues both to baffle and amaze the rise of parliament is one of the more surprising features</s>
<s>parliament is even challenging the authority of the mighty presidency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>parliament became somewhat more democratic after byelections in april to fill the seats of mps appointed to government</s>
<s>they brought in 43 nld mps after the party abandoned its boycott including miss suu kyi now free</s>
<s>what has happened since seems to vindicate those who have always claimed that the process of democracy would develop a momentum of its own despite the limitations of myanmar’s constitution which guarantees the army its 25 of parliamentary seats and a veto over constitutional change</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet a democratic flowering only partly explains the parliament’s vigour</s>
<s>intriguingly it also has to do with the ambitions of the 65yearold speaker shwe mann</s>
<s>he appears keen to challenge thein sein the president not just to lead the usdp but also to run for president</s>
<s>parliamentary elections are due in 2015 when the next president will also be chosen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the arrival of miss suu kyi and her colleagues certainly gave parliament a jolt</s>
<s>one of the nld’s parliamentarians win htein whom the regime previously jailed says usdp mps admit they are delighted that a boring chamber has become more lively</s>
<s>the nld has started to propose bills something previously viewed as an impertinence for a nongovernment party to do</s>
<s>one bill would even force cabinet ministers to reveal their financial assets</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the nld has also been adept at using parliamentary committees to scrutinise ministries and policies</s>
<s>this has emboldened usdp members too</s>
<s>indeed in the few weeks since the land investigations committee began work mps from several parties have fanned out taking evidence about flagrant or suspicious land grabs by military officers and their cronies</s>
<s>some 14000 acres 5670 hectares the committee says has been seized in mon state alone</s>
<s>it is unprecedented for the army to be challenged in this way</s>
<s>in addition miss suu kyi has been given her own parliamentary committee to preside over for “rule of law and stability”—something of a poisoned chalice at a time of hideous unrest in the western state of rakhine see banyan</s>
<s>the nld exerts influence out of proportion to its numbers</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in this the party has been encouraged by the ambitious mr shwe mann</s>
<s>just as the nld wants to use parliament to challenge the executive so does the speaker</s>
<s>however says mr win htein who has known him for years the difference is that whereas the nld wants to liberalise myanmar mr shwe man is “using parliament to launch his own presidential bid in 2015”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in a fastdeveloping rivalry with mr thein sein mr shwe mann backs any opportunity for parliament to assert its rights</s>
<s>in september an overwhelming majority of mps from all parties voted to impeach all nine judges of the constitutional court</s>
<s>appointed by the president they had tried to clip the wings of the parliamentary committees all the judges had to resign</s>
<s>a vital new foreigninvestment law has become a political football between mr thein sein and parliament</s>
<s>drafts have passed back and forth between the two with the army mps trying to protect their own financial interests against the more investorfriendly instincts of the president</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some believe that mr shwe mann’s next trick will be to introduce a system of proportional representation to replace the present winnertakesall electoral system</s>
<s>that could be the usdp’s best bet for hanging on to any vestiges of power after the next elections</s>
<s>for if april’s byelection results were repeated nationally in 2015 the nld would wipe the usdp from the map</s>
<s>under proportional representation the usdp would probably hang onto some seats and the smaller parties would also keep a few</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it is mps who elect the president and although miss suu kyi would be by far the country’s most popular candidate the constitution written by the generals bans her from running because she married a foreigner</s>
<s>possibly the constitution could be revised</s>
<s>but in that case mr shwe mann would play a central role in persuading government mps to vote for change</s>
<s>that however would undermine his own presidential prospects</s>
<s>mr thein sein is not the only person who should watch the speaker closely</s>
