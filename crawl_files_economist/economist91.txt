<s>think of how wifi has made computing so much more convenient</s>
<s>it has untethered users from pesky cable connections to the internet allowing them to wander around the home or office with laptop or tablet in hand surfing the web making free phone calls sending files wirelessly to printers video to tele­vision sets and many more things</s>
<s>but what if wifi radio beams travelled not just a few hundred feet but stretched for several miles—and were unimpeded by trees terrain and walls so that they could penetrate all the nooks and crannies within buildings</s>
<s>that is the promise of “whitespace” wireless</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>“whitespace” is technical slang for television channels that were left vacant in one city so as not to interfere with tv stations broadcasting on adjacent channels in a neighbouring city</s>
<s>in the early days of television americas broadcasting authorities reserved 50 or so channels for tv stations</s>
<s>but because of worries about interference no metropolitan area has ever come close to using all 50 channels at its disposal</s>
<s>in rural areas vacant channels ie whitespace have frequently amounted to 70 or more of the total bandwidth available for television broadcasting</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>with the recent switch from analogue to digital tele­vision much of this protective whitespace is no longer needed</s>
<s>unlike analogue broadcasting digital signals do not “bleed” into one another—and can therefore be packed closer together</s>
<s>all told the television networks now require little more than half the frequency spectrum they sprawled across previously</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the attraction of whitespace is that the frequencies used for television broadcasting 54mhz to 806mhz were chosen in the first place for the distance they could travel and their ability to penetrate obstacles</s>
<s>they were also good at transmitting information quickly</s>
<s>where wifi can shuttle data at 160300 megabits per second whitespace can do so at 400800 megabits per second</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in america the best frequencies for doing all this—the 700mhz band covering channels 52 to 69 on the old television dial—were auctioned off in 2008 to mobilephone companies</s>
<s>between them verizon att and others paid close to $20 billion for this “beachfront property” of the wireless spectrum</s>
<s>the whitespace freed below 700mhz is to be made available for unlicensed use by the public</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>do you want to play in my bandwidth</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>whitespace should help to solve the bandwidth problem that has begun to plague wireless networks in general—as more consumers download films television episodes and other video offerings wirelessly from the internet instead of receiving such fare from their traditional cable satellite or overtheair tv broadcasters</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a decade ago the biggest bandwidth hogs were computer users downloading music tracks from napster and other peertopeer websites</s>
<s>nowadays media seekers are more likely to be downloading whole television episodes from amazon itunes or hulu which typically gobble up 14 times the bandwidth of music tracks or streaming films from netflix 110 times</s>
<s>blame the current bandwidth crunch on the growing popularity of the iphone and android smartphones as well as media tablets like the ipad</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>apart from easing bandwidth problems whitespace could lead to a wireless revolution even bigger than the wave of innovation unleashed over a decade ago when wifi bluetooth and other wireless technologies embraced the unlicensed 24ghz band previously reserved for microwave ovens and garagedoor openers</s>
<s>some insiders even talk about whitespace offering a “third pipe” that will rival cable and telephone broadband for access to the internet</s>
<s>others see it as a cheaper alternative to todays mobilephone system</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>microsoft has been using just two experimental whitespace antennae instead of thousands of wifi access points to blanket its 500acre 200hectare campus in redmond washington</s>
<s>with whitespace hotspots capable of covering such wide areas supermarkets shopping malls even local municipalities could use it to offer free advertisingsupported internet services to their customers and local residents to search the web and make free telephone calls using skype google or something similar on their smartphones and other devices</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>pipedreams</s>
<s>far from it</s>
<s>technical hurdles remain but the first “enterpriselevel” pieces of whitespace equipment are about to go into service with commercial trials of various applications expected throughout 2012</s>
<s>how soon before individuals can buy $100 whitespace routers for the home</s>
<s>the consensus view is 2015 at the very latest </s>
