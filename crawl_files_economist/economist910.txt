<s>for two decades un peacekeeping missions have run radio stations</s>
<s>starting in cambodia in 1992 the idea was to disseminate reliable information before elections</s>
<s>the practice proved so successful that by 2010 un radio had spread to 13 countries mostly in africa including congo côte d’ivoire and liberia</s>
<s>but what happens when the peacekeepers leave</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>often the un hands its equipment over to local authorities</s>
<s>that approach has usually failed</s>
<s>in timorleste the inheritor of the un kit rttl “increasingly resembled a state information service rather than an autonomous public broadcaster” according to an independent report</s>

<p>
<s>in sierra leone which once hosted 17000 un peacekeepers the un tried a bold new approach</s>
<s>by merging its station—the country’s most popular—with the governmentcontrolled sierra leone broadcasting service it hoped to create a truly evenhanded publicservice broadcaster a rarity in africa</s>
<s>the un provided some cash though the station was meant to pay its own way through advertising</s>

<p>
<s>two years on all is far from well</s>
<s>reception is poor thanks to shoddy engineering</s>
<s>programmes routinely start late and suffer from government interference</s>
<s>claudia anthony who recently resigned as head of radio said that the government persistently meddled even insisting on slots for the ruling party’s announcements</s>

<p>
<s>money is at the root of the broadcaster’s many ills</s>
<s>an independent audit in 2010 said that financial controls were “very ineffective or nonexistent” by mid2012 the broadcaster was about three billion leones $690000 in debt</s>
<s>the un admits that the service is “not a success” but says it is determined to support it until after presidential elections due in november</s>

<p>
<s>in other countries that have un–paid radio new ideas are needed</s>
<s>the biggest test is congo</s>
<s>its tenyearold radio okapi run in tandem with the fondation hirondelle a swiss ngo that promotes free media has 14m daily listeners a fifth of the population</s>
<s>nicolas boissez who runs the foundation’s congolese branch says international oversight will be required when the un leaves</s>
<s>“the idea is not for a moment to transfer radio okapi to the local stateowned media” he says warily</s>
