<s>where do the world’s poor live</s>
<s>the obvious answer in poor countries</s>
<s>but in a recent series of articles andy sumner of britain’s institute of development studies showed that the obvious answer is wrong</s>
<s>fourfifths of those surviving on less than $2 a day he found live in middleincome countries with a gross national income per head of between $1000 and $12500 not poor ones</s>
<s>his finding reflects the fact that a long but inequitable period of economic growth has lifted many developing countries into middleincome status but left a minority of their populations mired in poverty</s>
<s>since the countries involved include giants like china and india even a minority amounts to a very large number of people</s>
<s>that matters because middleincome countries can afford to help their own poor</s>
<s>if most of the poverty problem lies within their borders then foreign aid is less relevant to poverty reduction</s>
<s>a better way to help would be to make middleincome countries’ domestic policies more “propoor”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now mr sumner’s argument faces a challenge</s>
<s>according to homi kharas of the brookings institution and andrew rogerson of britain’s overseas development institute “by 2025 most absolute poverty will once again be concentrated in lowincome countries” they argue that as middleincome countries continue to make progress against poverty its incidence there will fall</s>
<s>however the number of poor people is growing in “fragile” states which the authors define as countries which cannot meet their populations’ expectations or manage these through the political process sounds like some european nations too</s>
<s>the pattern that mr sumner describes they say is a passing phase</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>messrs kharas and rogerson calculate that the number of poor in “nonfragile” states has fallen from almost 2 billion in 1990 to around 500m now they think it will go on declining to around 200m by 2025</s>
<s>but the number of poor in fragile states is not falling—a testament both to the growing number of poor unstable places and to their fast population growth</s>
<s>this total has stayed flat at about 500m since 1990 and the authors think will barely shift until 2025</s>
<s>as early as next year the number of poor in what are sometimes called fracas fragile and conflictaffected states could be greater than the number in stable ones</s>
<s>that would imply something different to mr sumner’s view instead of being irrelevant to poverty reduction foreign aid will continue to be vital since fragile states unlike middleincome ones cannot afford to help the poor but instead need help themselves</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>can these two accounts be squared</s>
<s>it is worth noting that there is a group of countries that are both middleincome and fragile</s>
<s>this group sometimes called miffs middleincome fragile or failed states includes iraq nigeria pakistan and yemen—all large populous places</s>
<s>in 2011 geoffrey gertz and laurence chandy also of brookings calculated that almost a fifth of people living on less than $125 a day are citizens of miffs</s>
<s>so there are almost 200m poor people in middleincome and fragile states who appear in the accounts of both mr sumner and messrs kharas and rogerson</s>
<s>because of this overlap it is possible to argue both have a point and are just using different labels</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there is another explanation for the differences between them mr sumner is describing the presentday situation and messrs kharas and rogerson are forecasting what might happen in 2025</s>
<s>the trouble is that mr sumner has also produced forecasts in his case for 2020 and 2030 and they are strikingly different</s>
<s>he agrees with messrs kharas and rogerson that as middleincome countries take more people out of poverty the proportion of poor people who live in poor countries must rise</s>
<s>but this increase is much less on his calculations than on theirs</s>
<s>mr sumner estimates that by 2020 the share of the world’s poor in today’s poor countries will increase only from 20 to 40 even by 2030 there would still be roughly equal shares of the poor in today’s poor and middleincome countries</s>
<s>given that some of today’s poor countries will be middleincome ones by 2030 he reckons it is possible that only a third of all the world’s poor will be in countries called lowincome then</s>
<s>in contrast messrs kharas and rogerson think the majority of the poor will be in fragile states in 2025</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the gap between the forecasts also reflects differences in assumptions</s>
<s>some of these differences invite caution</s>
<s>the calculations by messrs kharas and rogerson using imf data seem to imply there will be hardly any poor people left in india and indonesia in a few years which seems unlikely</s>
<s>using different assumptions mr sumner forecasts that by 2030 the number of people in poverty could fall by anywhere between 600m and 16 billion an enormous margin of error</s>
<s>“any estimate of 2030 poverty including ours depends hugely on growth estimates for a few big countries…so i’d take all of them with oceans of salt” warns one of mr sumner’s coauthors charles kenny</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>income or politics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that said the two accounts do reflect different and important ways of thinking about poverty</s>
<s>one mr sumner’s focuses on income and says the big dividing line lies between poor and middleincome countries</s>
<s>the other associated with messrs kharas and rogerson focuses more on politics its dividing line is between fragile and stable countries</s>
<s>if messrs kharas and rogerson are right aid donors need to concentrate on governance and try to move countries from the fragile to the stable category—a daunting task</s>
<s>if mr sumner is right the role of donors should probably be to work with local governments in middleincome countries to ensure benefits from public spending are equitably distributed to the poorest wherever they may live</s>
