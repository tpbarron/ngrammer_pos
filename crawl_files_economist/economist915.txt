<s>fights often break out in icehockey arenas</s>
<s>usually however they happen during icehockey games not major politicalparty conventions</s>
<s>but on the first full day of the republican national convention the party adopted by voicevote changes to two rules one strengthening penalties for delegates who vote for a candidate other than the one that state law requires them to support and the other allowing the republican national committee rnc to change the party’s rules between conventions rather than putting them to a full vote at the convention itself</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>those changes prompted some supporters of ron paul a 12term congressman and candidate in the 2008 and 2012 republican primaries representing the party’s libertarian wing to storm out of the hall firing off charges of “voter suppression” and “election fraud”</s>
<s>many of the stormouts came from maine where mitt romney narrowly edged mr paul in the nonbinding popular vote the one who stayed on the convention floor shouting “fuck you tyrants” came of course from texas</s>
<s>but the superior organisation of mr paul’s supporters won him 20 delegates to mr romney’s four</s>
<s>a few weeks before the convention—and after some of his delegates had bought their tickets from maine to florida—some maine republicans filed a complaint with the rnc alleging multiple irregularities at the maine convention</s>
<s>mr paul’s delegates claimed that the rnc wanted to avoid the embarrassment of mr romney losing a state on the night he officially clinched the nomination</s>
<s>the rnc said the rulechange simply closed “a loophole in our party rules”</s>
<s>in the end maine awarded 14 delegates to mr romney and ten to mr paul</s>

<p>
<s>mr paul’s supporters can seem callow and obsessive as can mr paul himself who is prone to secreting sound sentiments—a fondness for limited government distaste for american sabrerattling—amid mounds of batty rhetoric</s>
<s>still his views attracted passionate support particularly among younger voters where republicans often struggle</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the question now is where those voters go</s>
<s>mr paul is 77 and will not seek another term in congress</s>
<s>the foreign policy of a president romney would lean far more towards neoconservatism than noninterventionism and though he is likelier than barack obama to slash spending he will not “end the fed” as one of mr paul’s books demanded</s>
<s>party insiders are no doubt hoping they will simply mature into mainstream republicans</s>
<s>but they may look elsewhere to gary johnson a former governor of new mexico and current libertarian presidential candidate or to another paul ron’s son rand an ambitious junior senator from kentucky</s>
