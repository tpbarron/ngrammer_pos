<s>it used to be said that as long as australias economy performed well governments in canberra could rest easy</s>
<s>the old adage no longer applies</s>
<s>australia will enter 2012 having avoided recession for 20 years</s>
<s>but australians are not about to give their political leaders credit for an economic feat that other countries should envy</s>
<s>success has turned australia into something of a splitpersonality nation complacent yet anxious about the future</s>
<s>the economy will continue to hum along smoothly</s>
<s>politics will be a different story</s>

<s>julia gillard the prime minister of the minority labor government had promised that 2011 would be a year of “delivery and decision”</s>
<s>she held the government together and won support for crucial legislation from capricious green and independent parliamentarians</s>
<s>an economy well managed through the global financial crisis gave her a strong story to tell</s>
<s>yet selling that story somehow eluded her</s>
<s>on this score she fared even worse than kevin rudd whom she unseated as labor leader and prime minister in 2010</s>
<s>as saul eslake an economist at the grattan institute a thinktank puts it “they were unable to make a silk purse out of a silk purse”</s>

<s>labor will limp into 2012 with the partys worst opinionpoll ratings in decades</s>
<s>only two things may stop labor from ditching ms gillard the lack of an obvious replacement mr rudd though more popular than she is with voters is deeply unpopular with his colleagues and the fear that sacking yet another leader would damage the party at the election due in 2013</s>
<s>buoyed by how much his populist teaparty approach to politics seemed to work in 2011 tony abbott the leader of the conservative liberalnational opposition will ramp up his taunts against the government on everything from a carbon tax to asylumseekers</s>

<s>chinas demand for iron ore and coal will underwrite projected growth of 34 in 201112</s>
<s>unemployment will hover around 5</s>
<s>short of a big economic wobble in china the terms of trade will stay at their highest level in 140 years</s>
<s>nonetheless australia will not remain immune from economic hardship in europe and america</s>
<s>spending more money to protect australia from another world recession would threaten the governments promise to return the budget to surplus in 201213 an injudicious boast on which much of its political capital hinges</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even as a mining boom linked to emerging asia makes australia rich more australians will feel no better off themselves</s>
<s>mining employs only 2 of the workforce</s>
<s>thanks to the boom the soaring value of australias currency will hurt many smaller businesses that find it harder to export their goods or compete with cheap imports</s>

<p>
<s>after legislation due by christmas australia will at last start taking action in 2012 to lower carbon emissions</s>
<s>burning coal to supply most of its electricity makes australias emissions per person among the worlds highest ten times bigger than indonesias five times bigger than chinas and almost three times those of france</s>
<s>in july 2012 australias 500 biggest polluters will start paying a tax on emissions ahead of an emissionstrading scheme due to start three years later</s>
<s>a milestone of economic reform awaits the labor government in july if it survives that long</s>
