<s>the house of representatives likes to think of itself as the nub of american democracy—“the people’s house” in the pious parlance of its occupants</s>
<s>but this year at least it is something of a sideshow</s>
<s>the race for the presidency is too close to call the contest for control of the senate is going down to the wire as well</s>
<s>but there is little suspense regarding the house</s>
<s>thanks both to the near parity of the two parties in the polls and to vigorous gerrymandering in favour of the status quo the republican majority seems certain to be returned albeit in slightly shrunken form</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all 435 seats in the house are up for grabs every two years</s>
<s>at each of the past three elections 20 seats or more have changed hands</s>
<s>these three “wave” elections constitute the most turbulent period in congressional politics since the 1940s</s>
<s>in 2006 the democrats wrested control of the house from the republicans and then added 21 seats to their majority in 2008</s>
<s>but the republicans regained all their losses and then some in 2010 winning a majority of 49 seats</s>
<s>for the past year the minority leader and former speaker nancy pelosi has insisted that the democrats can pick up the 25 seats necessary to return her to the speaker’s chair</s>
<s>but that is pure bluster most analysts predict a net democratic gain of ten seats at the very most</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on the face of things that seems peculiar</s>
<s>the present congress after all is reviled by voters just 10 approve of its performance according to our latest economistyougov poll</s>
<s>moreover after such a thumping republican victory two years ago democrats might naturally expect to claw back some lost ground</s>
<s>the electorate was heavily skewed to the right in 2010 whereas presidential years tend to draw out a more middleoftheroad crowd</s>
<s>and the average of recent polls compiled by realclearpolitics an electionfocused website puts the republicans just half a percentage point ahead of the democrats a far cry from their margin of 76 points in 2010</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the ebbing of 2010’s republican tide is visible in a few races</s>
<s>in the chicago suburbs for example joe walsh an outspoken republican lifted by teaparty activists to a 290vote victory in a leftleaning district in 2010 seems likely to be sent packing this time by tammy duckworth an army reservist who lost two limbs and the use of a third flying a helicopter in iraq</s>
<s>in upstate new york ann marie buerkle another freshman who won by a teastained whisker in 2010 is the underdog in a rematch against the former incumbent dan maffei</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but relatively few of the republican gains of the last election are in play this year thanks to the most recent round of redistricting</s>
<s>the landslide of 2010 also carried republicans to big majorities in many state legislatures just in time to preside over the redrawing of the congressional maps after the decennial census</s>
<s>they made the most of their ascendancy shoring up vulnerable incumbents</s>
<s>thus renee ellmers a nurse and political neophyte who narrowly upset a democratic fixture in north carolina last time has seen her district become strongly republican</s>
<s>by the same token the democratic tilt of the seat in wisconsin won in 2010 by sean duffy a former prosecutor and minor television celebrity has been erased</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the republicans have also used their edge in redistricting to undermine incumbent democrats</s>
<s>one seat in north carolina for example was redrawn so much in the republicans’ favour that the incumbent heath shuler declined to run leaving it almost certain to fall into republican hands</s>
<s>two other democratic seats in the state are also at risk thanks to gerrymanders concocted by the republicans in the state legislature</s>
<s>in utah jim matheson a sixterm incumbent finds himself in the most rightleaning seat in the country occupied by a democrat</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the democrats have responded in kind where they have been able to—most notably in illinois where they may pick up as many as five seats</s>
<s>in maryland democrats have stretched the district of roscoe bartlett one of just two republican representatives from the state from the mountainous western end of the state into the washington suburbs in a bid to end his 20year career</s>
<s>but there is a builtin bias in house elections towards the republicans as their supporters tend to be more dispersed and thus harder to cram into partisan ghettoes</s>
<s>what is more the democrats have sole control over redistricting in just eight states to the republicans’ 24</s>
<s>demographic change will gradually undermine the biased maps both sides have produced</s>
<s>but for this election at least the republican majority looks safe</s>
