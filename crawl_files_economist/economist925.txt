<s>time seems to flow inexorably in one direction</s>
<s>superficially that is because things deteriorate with age—and this in turn is because there are innumerably fewer ways to arrange particles in an orderly fashion than in a jumbled mess</s>
<s>any change in an existing arrangement is therefore likely to increase its disorder</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>dig a little deeper though and time’s arrow becomes mysterious</s>
<s>a particle cannot by itself become disordered so when you examine its behaviour in isolation the past and the future are hard to distinguish</s>
<s>if you film its movement and then give the film to someone else he will not be able to work out just from the particle’s behaviour which way to run the film through the projector</s>
<s>essentially the two ways of doing so are symmetrical</s>
<s>or so physicists used to think until hints to the contrary emerged in the 1960s</s>
<s>now a group of researchers at the slac national accelerator laboratory near stanford university in california have found the first physical evidence that backs those indications up</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the main hint that nature violates the timereversal t symmetry implied by the thought experiment with the film—and thus that there really is an arrow of time—came from seemingly disparate discoveries about matter and antimatter</s>
<s>mathematically particles and their antiversions differ in two ways they have opposite electrical charges and they are each other’s mirror reflections</s>
<s>but in 1964 some particles called kaons were shown not to respect this chargeconjugationparity cp symmetry as it is known</s>
<s>matter and antimatter are not in other words quite equal and opposite</s>
<s>however according to another law c p and t symmetries when lumped together into a single overarching cpt symmetry must be conserved</s>
<s>this means that if cp is violated then t must be too in order to even things out</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>…until reeled the mind</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the obvious place to look for this t violation is where c and p are already known to misbehave</s>
<s>between 1999 and 2008 a laboratory in california was set up to do just that</s>
<s>the old linear accelerator at stanford was repurposed turning it from the machine that codiscovered a particle known as the charm quark thus winning its operators a nobel prize into a factory for making particles called b mesons</s>
<s>these are interesting because they and their antiparticles exhibit cpviolating tendencies</s>
<s>they are thus a promising place to look for t violations too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>which is what the scientists of slac’s babar experiment have been doing</s>
<s>though the bmeson factory itself has been silent for four years the accelerator is now in its third incarnation as the world’s most powerful xray camera its data live on and the collaborators have been ploughing through them</s>
<s>they are looking in particular at how long it takes a bmeson to change its nature focusing on one particular member of the extended bmeson family the electrically neutral b0</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as with many things quantum b0 can exist in a number of forms</s>
<s>these are known as b bbar bplus and bminus</s>
<s>like a subatomic werewolf a b0 constantly shifts between them</s>
<s>if time truly has an arrow though some of these shifts will occur at a different rate when going in one direction rather than the other</s>
<s>in particular cpviolation theory predicts that bbar will turn into bminus faster than bminus turns into bbar</s>
<s>all that remains is to measure the difference</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>unfortunately that is not as easy as it sounds</s>
<s>a particle’s final state can be known by looking at what other sorts of particle it decays into</s>
<s>what cannot easily be known is what it was beforehand and for how long</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in the wacky world of quantum physics however it is not always impossible to work out what a particle once was but no longer is</s>
<s>that is because bmesons are sometimes born as quantummechanically conjoined twins</s>
<s>one twin gives away the initial state of the other and how long it lasted in that state—and all is revealed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that revelation which has been submitted for publication to physical review letters leaves no room for doubt bbars turn into bminuses far faster than bminuses turn into bbars</s>
<s>as many as five bminuses are produced for every bbar</s>
<s>the chance of this result being a fluke is a nugatory one in 1043</s>
<s>going forwards is thus not the same as going backwards and time’s arrow really does exist</s>
