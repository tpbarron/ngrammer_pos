<s>owen paterson the coalition government’s new environment secretary has some solid qualifications for the job</s>
<s>he is knowledgeable about farming an informed critic of the eu’s awful fisheries policy and is ready as needs must to cull consumptive badgers—despite having kept a couple of brocks as pets</s>
<s>yet mr paterson is also a climatechange sceptic agnostic about the extent to which global warming is manmade</s>
<s>this makes him an odd hire for the “greenest government ever” as david cameron promised his would be</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>it was no throwaway remark</s>
<s>in opposition the tory leader’s greenery was a main strut of his effort to “rebrand” read “socialise” his nasty old party</s>
<s>yet it amounted to much more than the cynical pr exercise it is increasingly remembered as</s>
<s>from opposition the tories helped initiate one of the world’s boldest pieces of environmental legislation the 2008 climate change act which includes a commitment to cutting britain’s greenhousegas emissions by 80 by 2050</s>
<s>mr cameron justified—nay demanded—this on economic grounds</s>
<s>“i want to make my position on this absolutely clear” he said</s>
<s>“we are not going to drop the environmental agenda in an economic downturn”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the government’s green policies are still extremely ambitious</s>
<s>they include a plan to replace ageing coalfired and nuclear power stations with wind and solar farms such that up to 30 of britain’s electricity could be generated from renewable sources by 2020</s>
<s>this is to be accomplished mainly by negotiating a fixed electricity price with potential investors as will be outlined in a new energy bill due to be published by the department of energy and climate change decc in the next few weeks</s>
<s>voters would nonetheless be right to conclude and polls show have concluded that the government has gone off greenery</s>
<s>“the language has shifted since before the election in a very very dramatic way” says zac goldsmith a tory mp once encouraged by mr cameron to act as his party’s green conscience</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>as prime minister mr cameron has not made a single proper speech on the environment</s>
<s>discussion of the issue has instead been commandeered by the hardheaded ideologues—greens and antigreens—it attracts</s>
<s>the tories have a surfeit of the antis</s>
<s>on the right of the party climatechange scepticism euroscepticism and latterly detestation of the liberal democrats presiding over decc are related creeds</s>
<s>those who hold them also share an aversion to onshore wind turbines one of britain’s cheapest forms of renewable power that is borderline obsessive</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a more potent challenge comes from george osborne the chancellor of the exchequer who worries as is his function about the costs of the green policies he once espoused</s>
<s>the treasury has wrought cuts in toogenerous wind and solarpower subsidies and stymied the borrowing powers of a green investment bank</s>
<s>given the high cost of renewables the chancellor is also arguing for a bigger role for gasfired power than the government’s emissionscutting targets appear to allow</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the new energy bill is the latest battleground in this fight with the treasury most exercised on two points</s>
<s>one is the inclusion in the draft of a limit in effect on the emissions permissible from british power stations after 2020</s>
<s>this would probably prohibit the new “dash for gas” mr osborne wants</s>
<s>his minions are also seeking hugely to reduce the sum of subsidies and generation contracts decc will be allowed to deploy</s>
<s>decc says this figure needs to be high to signal to investors that britain is serious about its lowcarbon shift</s>
<s>the treasury counters that electricity consumers who will pay the inflated cost of green energy in their bills would be overburdened</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>having endured a long economic slump and an historic fall in living standards britons have more mundane concerns than the environment—including rocketing fuel bills</s>
<s>over the past five years the proportion of britons telling pollsters that the environment is among their main concerns has accordingly plummeted from 19 to around 4</s>
<s>this naturally explains why mr cameron is not trumpeting his green policies as he once did</s>
<s>yet his silence on the issue is less politically shrewd than it seems</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a hard sell</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>energy policy is complicated and divisive so easily misrepresented</s>
<s>this is happening in several ways</s>
<s>one concerns the price rises that will follow a big move to renewable power</s>
<s>they are not as antis commonly suggest imminent</s>
<s>they will be mainly felt after 2017 by which time it must be hoped the british economy will be in ruder health</s>
<s>advocates of a dash for gas moreover are implicitly making a risky bet on future prices</s>
<s>a renewablesheavy energy mix would probably cost british consumers more than a gasheavy one but it would carry a much lower risk of price shocks</s>
<s>that is a more finely balanced comparison than most critics of the government’s prorenewables policy allow</s>
<s>but the most serious misrepresentation of all is the notion that the government has any good alternative to its plans</s>
<s>they have been designed to meet pollution mitigation and renewables targets which however deplorable to the treasury are binding under british law and eu directives</s>
<s>they cannot be shirked</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that mr cameron has propelled the government into an industrial makeover at a time of economic turmoil is rotten luck</s>
<s>but since he cannot turn back he might as well press on with more vim</s>
<s>this would meet a growing concern that the tory leader is a fairweather thinker—the latest yougov poll suggests only 16 of people think the prime minister “sticks to what he believes in”</s>
<s>moreover the tory leader’s argument that britain has an economic as well as a political imperative to green its economy was persuasive as well as brave</s>
<s>it was also in its way invigorating</s>
<s>glum britons could do with another jolt</s>
