<s>zakaria shahadeh is a syrian sea captain operating between jeddah and somali ports</s>
<s>“see this” he says pointing to a scar along his lower jaw</s>
<s>“pirates did this” he lights another cigarette and leans back in his cabin—it is an oily hot night off the somaliland port of berbera—and tells his story</s>
<s>in 2010 he says he sailed a freighter at full speed straight out of mogadishu somalias capital</s>
<s>he didnt slow down</s>
<s>“they caught us 200 nautical miles offshore” he and his crew were held for 43 days</s>
<s>what ransom did he pay</s>
<s>“for me $500000</s>
<s>they asked for $2m”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>he will be plying the same seas in 2012</s>
<s>“it is my life” but he wont get caught again he now captains a car carrier converted to transport tens of thousands of goats from somalia bound for mecca smelly yet somehow sacred</s>
<s>if pirates captured his vessel the animals would die within days and the smell would be gagging</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>animal protection aside 2012 will be the biggest year yet for pirates</s>
<s>nearly all of them will be somalis launching from somalia</s>
<s>in 2012 their operational range will push beyond the maldives beyond mauritius and deep into the red sea</s>
<s>foreign navies will monitor rather than stop the pirates</s>
<s>the seas are just too vast even with their technology and gunnery skills for fighting ships to get to vessels before the pirates board and capture them</s>
<s>and with so many dhows and fishing skiffs plying the coastal waters of somalia and yemen there is no way of knowing which is an honest vessel and which is a pirate one</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>navy commanders in the year ahead will grudgingly acknowledge the rockandroll character of the pirates albeit of a very local flavour</s>
<s>but they will not admit that they are powerless to turn back the economics driving the piracy</s>
<s>in 2012 young somali men will risk all because they have no jobs suffer in the heat and are addicted to qat a local leaf stimulant</s>
<s>above all they see the chance of a stonking wedding to an impossibly attractive bride a car even a house if a big ransom is paid</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>although mercenary action is possible direct foreign military intervention in somalia in pursuit of pirates is unlikely in 2012 and probably futile too</s>
<s>that means several hundred more vessels including oil tankers will find themselves anchored off somalia with their crews imprisoned</s>
<s>ransoms will rise in 2012 tempting big somali businessmen to hedge their livestock and property investments by underwriting pirate gangs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the big worry in 2012 is that the relentless logic of rot and ransoms will see the pirates come ashore</s>
<s>kidnappings of rich locals and foreigners the length of the kenyan coast and beyond can be expected with bungling local security unable to provide much protection</s>
<s>the risk is that kidnappings by somali gangs will lead to grisly copycat operations dampening both investment and tourism in a wider region</s>
