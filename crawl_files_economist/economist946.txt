<s>“i think it’d all work fine this thing british democracy” says walter harrison mp in “this house” a crackling new westminster farce playing at the national theatre</s>
<s>“if it weren’t so damn reliant on people…people who change their mind who forget who they are”</s>

<p>
<s>it was the job of the reallife walter harrison to remind them</s>
<s>harrison who died on october 19th was a labour whip for 17 of his 23 years in parliament</s>
<s>that the minority labour government of 197479—the subject of “this house”—survived for as long as it did was partly a testament to his ferocity</s>
<s>his car registration khe 2l stood for “kick harrison’s enemies to hell”</s>
<s>while once chatting with a young jack straw harrison a bluff yorkshireman grabbed the future foreign secretary’s testicles and when mr straw gasping asked the reason why the whip snarled “nowt</s>
<s>but think what i’d do if you crossed me”</s>

<s>how david cameron must yearn for such a man</s>
<s>on october 31st his coalition government lost a vote on the european union’s post2014 budget after its whips—led by sir george young a courteous septuagenarian—failed to dissuade 53 eurosceptic tory rebels from voting against the government</s>
<s>at issue was mr cameron’s negotiating position on the budget which is due to be discussed at an eu summit later this month</s>
<s>mr cameron had asked parliament to support his demand for a realterm budget freeze</s>
<s>but an amendment tabled by tory rebels proposed to cut the budget and after labour piled in to support it the motion was carried by a slender margin</s>
<s>the defeat is unlikely to alter mr cameron’s negotiating position much</s>
<s>but it raises pressure on the prime minister over his party’s most fractious issue britain’s strained relations with the eu</s>
<s>it is also the latest of many indications that mr cameron’s grasp on his party is slipping</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are problems at the top</s>
<s>in recent weeks several tory ministers have made statements that secondguess or flatly contradict government policy</s>
<s>the newly appointed energy secretary john hayes has attacked wind turbines</s>
<s>yet they are one of the main spars of the government’s energy policy</s>
<s>eric pickles the communities secretary has warned against passing any new law to regulate the media</s>
<s>yet lord justice leveson a judge charged with looking into the matter may be about to recommend one—and mr cameron has said he should not be preempted</s>
<s>the threat to the prime minister in parliament as the eu budget defeat has shown is more serious</s>
<s>the government has suffered bigger rebellions including last year when 81 tory eurosceptics voted for a referendum on eu membership</s>
<s>yet the budget vote is the first to end in defeat for the government and it was organised remarkably in only three days</s>
<s>“every rebellion is better organised than the last” a tory mp laments</s>
<s>“each leaves more blood in the water”</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr cameron does not seem terribly worried</s>
<s>opinion polls suggest he is still britain’s most popular party leader and his personal ratings are steady even though his party’s are flagging</s>
<s>yet in an effort to restore his party’s fraying discipline he has at least tried to find a harrison</s>
<s>in september mr cameron appointed andrew mitchell a former army officer nicknamed “thrasher” to be the government chief whip</s>
<s>the prime minister also gave him a talented fresh cohort of junior whips to command including jo johnson a brother of boris london’s mayor</s>
<s>under mr mitchell’s predecessor patrick mcloughlin the tory chief whip since 2005 the whips had been considered too friendly and ineffectual</s>
<s>many tories—including masochistically some of the rebels—thought a spell of barking and ballgrabbing was in order</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr mitchell made a good start</s>
<s>he attached his juniors to mps with whom they had an affinity—thereby ending a decadesold tradition of divvying up mps into regionally delineated flocks</s>
<s>yet mr mitchell lasted barely a month</s>
<s>he was forced to resign on october 19th the day harrison died after offending a policeman with an outburst of rude language</s>
<s>mr cameron backed him many tory backbenchers and junior whips did not</s>
<s>in a way therefore the chief whip fell victim to the very problem he had been dispatched to solve—mr cameron’s fading authority over his own party</s>

<s>a bad leader blames his whip</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that is a problem too great for whips to solve—even under thrasher</s>
<s>in fact the days of outrageous armtwisting à la harrison are mostly past</s>
<s>the whips office is weaker than it has ever been</s>
<s>in recent years the chief whip or “patronage secretary” as he is still known has lost control over the last of the blandishments—including peerages jobs in national companies and berths on parliamentary select committees—that were once within his gift</s>
<s>moreover the rebelliousness of the current parliament is deeprooted and hard to quell</s>
<s>one reason for this is disenchantment with coalition politics especially among tory backbenchers who tend to blame lib dems for taking their jobs and mr cameron for letting it happen</s>
<s>another is a surge in independentminded mps especially among the many tory parvenus in parliament from the 2010 intake who tend to be much keener to get their views out on twitter than to take them from a whip</s>
<s>finally of course there is the cancerous issue of europe which can put the most reasonable conservatives into a selfdestructive rage</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>these are tough problems</s>
<s>yet if he is to staunch the blood mr cameron must grapple with them</s>
<s>many tory mps consider that he does not listen to their complaints the tory leader appears in particular to have paid too little heed to mr mcloughlin</s>
<s>he must do better by sir george</s>
<s>the new chief whip is no bully boy but he has a deep knowledge of parliament which mr cameron needs to learn from</s>
