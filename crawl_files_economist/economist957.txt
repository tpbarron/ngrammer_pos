<s>in an industry noted for its conservatism anglo american stood out</s>
<s>even more than other global miners it was stuck in its ways</s>
<s>so the appointment of cynthia carroll as its boss in 2007 was unexpected</s>
<s>unlike all her forerunners she was neither south african nor an insider nor a man</s>
<s>for a firm that trailed its rivals and was missing out on an extraordinary commodities boom she seemed just the tonic</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>granted some managers were irked and remained so throughout her tenure</s>
<s>lately more shareholders have joined the grumbling</s>
<s>anglo’s ills are multiplying</s>
<s>its south african mines have been racked by strikes</s>
<s>its copper assets in chile are contested</s>
<s>its ironore projects are delayed</s>
<s>on october 26th mrs carroll announced that she would quit after a successor is chosen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>some of the barbs aimed at mrs carroll are unfair</s>
<s>she made anglo’s mines safer places to work and improved relations with governments</s>
<s>operationally anglo did fairly well</s>
<s>but compared with other mining giants such as bhp billiton and rio tinto it has lagged badly</s>
<s>since 2007 when all three got new bosses anglo’s shares have fallen by 25 whereas rio’s are up by 40 and bhp’s by 115 see chart</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>slowmoving anglo failed to strike transformational deals of the sort that built bhp and rio into immense diversified mining groups</s>
<s>as ben davis of liberum capital a bank points out anglo didn’t have the right mix of commodities to take advantage of chinese growth</s>
<s>and mrs carroll failed to decide whether to ape rio and bhp or make the most of anglo’s distinctiveness</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>rio and bhp have huge and lucrative ironore operations—an area where anglo had failed to bulk up</s>
<s>to put this right mrs carroll did her biggest deal—the acquisition for $55 billion of minas rio a giant brazilian ironore mine in 2008</s>
<s>alas this was at the top of the commodities cycle</s>
<s>and brazilian red tape has led to delays and spiralling costs for a mine that may not produce ore until 2015</s>
<s>meanwhile china’s slowdown means that ironore prices may never regain their recent heights</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>anglo’s attitude to platinum also takes some explaining</s>
<s>it hardly fits the riobhp model of running large lowcost expandable mines—often big open pits</s>
<s>platinum has high fixed costs twothirds are wages low margins and mainly comes from deep underground</s>
<s>rather than straining to keep anglo as the global market leader mrs carroll might have invested the cash more profitably in another metal or in a country other than south africa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mrs carroll’s successor may slim the platinum business down or spin it off</s>
<s>the new boss will probably have to keep trying with minas rio however</s>
<s>and he or she will have to decide what to do about south africa</s>
<s>anglo’s shares are weak partly because some twofifths of its assets are in a country where strikes are sometimes lethal and politicians talk airily of nationalising mines</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the next boss needs a free hand says jeff largey of macquarie a bank</s>
<s>that might be tricky under the chairman sir john parker who is a forceful character and deeply involved in running the company</s>
<s>instead of restructuring a better plan might be to buff up anglo for the sort of megamerger it has so far eschewed</s>
<s>the firm that was once south africa’s biggest is now the prey not the hunter</s>
