<s>in some parts of the new digital world it is obvious who is in charge</s>
<s>google rules in search facebook in social networking amazon in retail</s>
<s>these territories are still being fought over microsofts bing is attacking google in search google is attacking facebook in social and so forth</s>
<s>but these are all large relatively mature fields</s>
<s>during 2012 the more interesting battles will be those taking place on the smaller lesserknown territories on the fringes of the technology world in areas such as mobile payments location and augmented reality</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>they may seem marginal fields now but it is worth remembering that social networking went from obscurity a decade ago to being used by hundreds of millions of people today accounting for more time online than any other activity according to a survey of american internet users by nielsen a marketresearch firm</s>
<s>like search social and online retail these promising new territories have the potential to transform peoples lives but have yet to be conquered</s>
<s>so who has designs on them</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>start with mobile payments</s>
<s>one of the oddities of technological progress is that it is easier to use your mobile phone to pay for a taxi in nairobi than in new york</s>
<s>that is because kenya is a world leader in mobilepayment systems which have proved particularly popular in the developing world as an alternative to conventional banking and payment methods</s>
<s>in the developed world efforts to replace wallets and credit cards with mobile phones have been held up by bickering between banks and mobile operators over who will “own” the customer and who will pay to upgrade the pointofsale equipment used by millions of retailers</s>

<s>so keep an eye on two companies that could break the logjam in 2012</s>
<s>the first is square a startup founded by jack dorsey who also cofounded twitter</s>
<s>his firm makes a small square device that plugs into an apple iphone or androidbased smartphone and turns it into a mobile till that can take creditcard payments</s>
<s>visit a farmers market in san francisco and you will probably see one in action</s>
<s>the next iteration of the technology allows customers who have bought something in this way to use their iphones instead of their credit cards for subsequent purchases</s>
<s>this is a nifty bottomup way of doing what years of topdown planning have failed to achieve</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the other company to watch is apple under its new boss tim cook</s>
<s>the firm has repeatedly taken a halffinished idea digital music player smartphone tablet computer and shown the industry how it should be done</s>
<s>expect it to attempt this again in 2012 with mobile payments by embedding a wireless chip into a new version of the iphone</s>
<s>apple could thus enable every iphone to make and receive payments linking the whole system to the credit cards of more than 200m people who already use its itunes service</s>
<s>if anyone can create a mobilepayments infrastructure overnight spawning copycat moves from others and opening up an entirely new market it is apple</s>
<s>to provide compatibility with older iphones and with android devices apple might then become the logical buyer of square</s>
<s> also active in this area are paypal which dominates payments on the desktop internet and google which launched a mobilewallet service in 2011</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>locationbased services are another field that has yet to take off</s>
<s>mobile operators have been pushing locationspecific advertisements and coupons for years</s>
<s>more recently startups such as foursquare and gowalla have tried to give smartphone users incentives to share their locations with a view to commercialising this information</s>
<s>but location information is most useful when tied to other things—such as the photos status updates and recommendations shared on social networks</s>
<s>plenty of action is likely in 2012 as the location startups both compete and cooperate with the big social networks facebook twitter and google which will continue to integrate location information into their services</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a similar situation pertains in the field of augmented reality ar the scifi trick of overlaying information from the internet onto a realtime view of the real world</s>
<s>at the moment this is a party trick that can be performed with a handful of smartphone apps such as layar wikitude and google goggles and on some games consoles such as the nintendo 3ds</s>
<s>but as location and socialnetwork information are knitted together ar becomes the logical way to display the results highlighting your friends in a crowd at a festival for example and eventually enabling your glasses to remind you of the name of the person you are talking to at a conference together with their most recent postings on social networks</s>
<s>once again this is enticing new territory that both startups and the big social networks have in their sights along with search engines and hardware vendors</s>
<s>at the moment apple is the company to beat when it comes to packaging cuttingedge technology in an elegant easytouse form</s>
<s>will apple some day launch a set of augmentedreality goggles—iglasses perhaps </s>
