<s>the clatter of the book’s pinballing plot stylistic tics—ranks of exclamation marks</s>
<s> stuttering ellipses—and bulk may prove too much for many readers</s>

<s>“one must occasionally suffer for style” the author told the paris review</s>
<s>mr wolfe was talking about his overcoat but the line could apply to readers as well</s>
<s>yes this tale of urban manners is familiar wolfian territory—a city on steroids a riptide of racial politics a bonfire on the beach but then if you can’t stand the heat you shouldn’t stay in miami</s>
