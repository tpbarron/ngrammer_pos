<s>it is one of the worlds great cities—with problems to match</s>
<s>london is britains economic engine generating more than onefifth of its wealth</s>
<s>yet its greatest industry finance is perpetually under attack</s>
<s>londons immigrants who give the capital its energy also put huge pressure on hospitals and transport</s>
<s>the citys schools are bursting</s>
<s>it is an obvious terrorist target</s>
<s>sadly few of londons difficulties or its greatness are evoked by the race to become the citys next mayor</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the election which takes place on may 3rd pits boris johnson the conservative incumbent pictured right against ken livingstone a leftwinger who ran london between 2000 and 2008</s>
<s>the battle between the two main challengers has been dominated by niggling personal issues and trivial disputes</s>
<s>is mr livingstones use of a legal taxavoidance vehicle inconsistent with his socialism</s>
<s>did mr johnson spend too much money on some retrochic doubledecker buses</s>
<s>were mr livingstones tears at a campaign broadcast genuine</s>
<s>is mr johnson sexist</s>
<s>the incumbent has a slight lead in polls</s>
<s>but his party has grown toxic in london</s>
<s>the vote should be close</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr johnson has been a good mayor rather than a great one</s>
<s>his image of touslehaired disorganisation is not merely a pose</s>
<s>he has a habit of fastening on social problems setting up an advisory group then losing interest</s>
<s>under great pressure—following last summers riots for example—he can wilt</s>
<s>mr livingstone ran london as a machine mr johnson occasionally appears to forget where the levers are</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>yet he has two great things to recommend him</s>
<s>the first is that on the big issues his instincts are right</s>
<s>the mayor defended bankers and called for a cut in the top rate of income tax when both positions were deeply unfashionable</s>
<s>he is socially liberal</s>
<s>for years he has been enthusiastic about immigration and has even called for an amnesty for illegal immigrants although he has bowed to a harder more conventional line in the past few days</s>
<s>he has also done a good job of getting cash for infrastructure from central government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>his second advantage is that he is not ken livingstone</s>
<s>londons first elected mayor began boldly</s>
<s>belying his leftwing instincts he introduced a congestion charge inspired by milton friedman and cosied up to the city</s>
<s>this newspaper backed him for a second term</s>
<s>disappointingly though mr livingstone has gradually conformed to the “red ken” stereotype</s>
<s>he claims he can cut publictransport fares and even the rents londoners pay private landlords</s>
<s>over time an ugly side to mr livingstones personality has emerged</s>
<s>he has shown startling insensitivity towards jewish people</s>
<s>this would be unattractive in any politician</s>
<s>in the mayor of a diverse and occasionally tense city it is intolerable</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>give him something important to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>this newspaper would like mr johnson to serve another term—and pull his finger out</s>
<s>we do not imagine though that he will abruptly be transformed into an englishaccented michael bloomberg</s>
<s>for that to happen the mayoralty itself would have to be radically changed</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a big reason the mayoral race has degenerated into squabbles over personal taxes and the shape of buses is that the candidates do not have much more to talk about</s>
<s>londons mayor has great power over transport as well as rather less power over housing and planning</s>
<s>he has almost no sway over education and health</s>
<s>the legislatures of scotland and wales with a combined population roughly equal to londons are much more powerful</s>
<s>most emasculating of all less than 10 of the money londons mayor spends comes from local property taxes</s>
<s>the rest comes from central government which often tells the mayor how to spend the cash</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>if the mayoralty is to become a serious job attracting serious candidates this must change</s>
<s>one thing mr johnson has demonstrated is that londons police chief cannot hold on to his job if the mayor wants him gone</s>
<s>that power should be made formal</s>
<s>there is a case too for giving the mayor more sway over education power is rightly being devolved by local authorities to individual schools but westminster still keeps too much to itself</s>
<s>as america shows mayors are often the boldest education reformers mr bloomberg is not the only mayor who has transformed local schools</s>
<s>most of all londons mayor should be allowed to raise more money locally</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>londons mayor has the biggest personal mandate in british politics</s>
<s>he or she is a model to other cities that are toying with the idea of elected mayors</s>
<s>mr johnson has carried his responsibilities rather lightly</s>
<s>time to increase his burden</s>
