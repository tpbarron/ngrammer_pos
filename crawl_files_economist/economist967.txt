<s>iraq is blessed with abundant oil that is cheap to extract and close to newly built export terminals</s>
<s>production has hit a threedecade high and continues to rise steadily</s>
<s>by 2035 predicts the international energy agency iea an advocate for richworld consumers iraqi output could more than double to 83m barrels per day bd</s>

<p>
<s>but western oil firms are increasingly reluctant to play a part in this boom</s>
<s>exxonmobil appears keen to sell its stake in west qurna one of the giant fields in southern iraq that will provide much of the production growth</s>
<s>royal dutch shell and bp are both still working in the south but unhappily so</s>
<s>suffocating bureaucracy and onerous contract terms make life difficult</s>

<s>three years ago when they signed contracts with the iraqi government the oil majors were prepared to accept hiccups</s>
<s>but their patience has thinned with the arrival of an alternative source of iraqi oil</s>
<s>kurdistan the semiautonomous province in the country’s north has been offering competing and much more lucrative deals</s>
<s>exxonmobil’s decision last year to acquire six blocks in the region angered the central government which considers the deal illegal and lays claim to kurdish oil</s>
<s>but the world’s largest oil company started a trend</s>
<s>in july total chevron and gazprom all signed contracts with the kurdistan regional government potentially dooming their chances of winning future business in the south</s>
<s>bg a british firm was in erbil the kurdish capital on a scouting mission in late october</s>

<s>“kurdistan is 11 years ahead of the rest of iraq in terms of political and commercial development” says luay alkhatteeb head of the iraq energy institute a londonbased thinktank</s>
<s>kurdistan’s potential oil reserves of around 45 billion barrels are less than a third of those in southern iraq</s>
<s>still the kurdish oil minister ashti hawrami believes output of 1m bd is possible within three years</s>

<p>
<s>the tricky part is getting the oil to market</s>
<s>the kurds today export around 200000 bd through pipelines controlled by the central government</s>
<s>mr hawrami wants to build a new kurdishowned pipe to turkey feeding longheld dreams of kurdish independence</s>
<s>that unnerves turkey which is fighting kurdish separatists in its southeast</s>
<s>some turkish officials seem to acknowledge the possibility of an eventual kurdish state in northern iraq and seek to make it commercially dependent on turkey</s>
<s>cooperating with the iraqi kurds would also generate lucrative transit fees and offer turkey an alternative to oil from russia and iran</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>so far turkey has only allowed the iraqi kurds to export oil by lorry</s>
<s>to win approval for a pipeline they would probably have to support turkish opposition to kurdish separatism outside iraq</s>
<s>that seems unlikely</s>
<s>but the growing civil war in syria is helping the kurds</s>
<s>recep tayyip erdogan turkey’s prime minister is angry with the iraqi government for supporting syria’s murderous regime</s>
<s>backing kurdish oil exports makes that point</s>
<s>but approving a pipeline may be a step too far for mr erdogan just now</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the iraqi government is pondering how to respond</s>
<s>it could sweeten the terms of its contracts with the oil firms in the south</s>
<s>that might staunch the flow of western capital to kurdistan</s>
<s>in the meantime the main beneficiaries of the majors’ receding interest in southern iraq are asian oil firms</s>
<s>chinese will account for about 2m bd of iraq’s production by 2020</s>
