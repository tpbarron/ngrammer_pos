<s>the current financial crisis is merely a severe example of the panics and crashes that have dotted economic history</s>
<s>lenders and borrowers have regularly overestimated the latter’s ability to repay their debts when the truth becomes clear banks collapse and confidence in the financial system deteriorates</s>

<p>
<s>as scott reynolds nelson shows in his history of american financial crises there have been many parallels with recent events</s>
<s>the subprime loans that sparked the current crisis were modern versions of the promissory notes bills of exchange and bankers’ acceptances that were used in the past all are “promises to repay”</s>
<s>such promises are easy to make in a boom but harder to keep when times change</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>america was slow in developing its own financial system depending on credit from britain</s>
<s>this made american banks vulnerable to the tightening of monetary policy across the atlantic</s>
<s>but there were plenty of internal drivers of crises</s>
<s>as a 19thcentury emerging market america was the natural focus for speculative bubbles in land railroads and cotton</s>
<s>there were also political fights over central banking and over the backing for the currency gold silver or just paper</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the author does an excellent job of putting these crises in a wider context</s>
<s>he recounts how herman melville’s family was ruined by president andrew jackson’s battle with the second bank of the united states an early version of a central bank</s>
<s>in “moby dick” captain ahab who like jackson was disfigured by a scar obsessively pursued the great white whale bringing disaster on the crew just as jackson’s obsession with the banking leviathan plunged the economy into recession</s>

<p>
<s>he also shows how speculation played its part in the buildup to the civil war as slavers and northern investors sought to acquire land</s>
<s>the south was led by jefferson davis who had been a prominent supporter in the 1840s of mississippi’s debt repudiation making it difficult for the fledgling state to raise capital in europe</s>
<s>by contrast the northerners were led by abraham lincoln a lawyer who had supported the railroad industry and thus european bondholders against land seizures by states</s>
<s>that was one factor giving the north a crucial financial advantage</s>

<s>at times however mr nelson seems to have a shaky grasp of dates as when he writes that the “first new deal seemed to have little effect on the us economy as the number of unemployed went from 48m in 1930 to 145m in march 1933”</s>
<s>president roosevelt was only inaugurated on march 4th 1933 so his new deal can hardly have reduced unemployment before he took office</s>
<s>at another stage he seems to confuse america’s annual deficit with its total debt of $14 trillion</s>
<s>in that context his last chapter which dismisses how other historians have written about financial panics is too much of a hostage to fortune</s>
<s>“manias panics and crashes” by the master of the genre the late charles kindleberger is still the book to beat</s>
