<s>londons mayoral race which concludes on may 3rd has hardly done the city proud</s>
<s>boris johnson the conservative incumbent is running more on personality than policy</s>
<s>his labour rival ken livingstone is fronting a tired and petulant campaign</s>
<s>still the contest has produced one innovation that might prove contagious in british politics</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>on april 5th the two main candidates along with the liberal democrat brian paddick and green hopeful jenny jones published records of how much tax they have paid in recent years</s>
<s>this bout of openness was prompted by suggestions that mr livingstone had tried to limit his tax liability in a way that is legal but hard to reconcile with his avowed leftwingery</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>george osborne the chancellor of the exchequer soon hinted that the government would consider publishing the tax returns of the most senior cabinet members</s>
<s>then on april 11th david cameron said it was “increasingly likely” he would become the first british prime minister to publish his annual tax statement</s>
<s>there is also talk of compelling highearners in other parts of the public sector to do the same</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the government has shown a zeal for transparency before it is publishing great quantities of data about spending and publicservice performance</s>
<s>but its motives in this particular instance are as much political as ethical</s>
<s>squeezed voters feel aggrieved about the gambits deployed by some rich folk and companies to minimise the amount of tax they pay</s>
<s>mr osborne who was deplored for cutting the income tax rate for the highest earners in his recent budget has begun to talk tough about closing loopholes</s>
<s>if the authors of austerity can show that their personal contribution to the public purse is as it should be resentment of their wealth and privilege might ease</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr johnson for example has earned a tidy sum from a newspaper column and other side projects</s>
<s>but as he paid his full measure of tax on it there has been little outrage</s>
<s>and once the government has opened its tax books to scrutiny it would be politically difficult for labours front bench to resist doing the same</s>
<s>if anything the likes of ed miliband who as leader of the opposition has been vociferous in his attacks on tax avoidance might be held to a higher standard than the government</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>there are some worries about this sudden trend however</s>
<s>it is not yet clear whether senior members of the government will be open about the tax they pay on all their different sources of money which might include trust funds and inherited assets</s>
<s>if they only declare their personal income tax voters will find it hard to properly compare one politicians tax contribution to anothers</s>
<s>popular cynicism could deepen</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and if the zeal for openness starts with tax it might move on to other aspects of a politicians private circumstances</s>
<s>mr osborne cites approvingly the convention of american presidential candidates opening up their tax returns</s>
<s>but the americans also often have to publish their medical records</s>
<s>politicians might come to regret embarking on the path of transparency</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>above all there is the fear that these declarations will further personalise politics</s>
<s>almost all discussion about the large issues facing london has been crowded out by the candidates claims and counterclaims regarding their tax records</s>
<s>it would be sad if general elections became as unedifying as the race between mr johnson and mr livingstone</s>
