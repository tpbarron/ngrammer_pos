<s>for more than a decade barclays a british bank had hitched its wagon to the rapid growth of global bond markets</s>
<s>under the leadership of bob diamond—who stepped down as chief executive in july amid revelations that staff at the bank had been trying to manipulate libor a benchmark interest rate—barclays’ capitalmarkets arm had expanded from a tiny business to a leader in many important investmentbanking markets</s>
<s>and despite efforts by the firm to expand its traditional retail and commercial banking the investment bank came to dominate both barclays’ profits—and more important its culture</s>
<s>many inside and outside the firm came to blame its hardcharging investment bankers for emphasising quick trading profits over longterm relationships with clients</s>
<s>the bank was this week hit by news of another criminal investigation by britain’s serious fraud office into payments it made when raising capital in the middle east in 2008</s>

<s>the appointment on august 30th of antony jenkins as chief executive suggests the bank hopes to focus again on the somewhat slowerpaced business of collecting savings and making loans</s>
<s>it comes after the appointment earlier this month of sir david walker a vocal critic of the remuneration of investment bankers as chairman</s>
<s>mr jenkins is as experienced a retail and commercial banker as you might hope to find</s>
<s>he has spent much of his career in retail banking</s>
<s>his former roles include heading barclaycard the bank’s international creditcard division as well as leading its retail and businessbanking arms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr jenkins is highly regarded within the bank and is seen by analysts as having a very good grasp of the detail of retail banking</s>
<s>yet despite his experience in a part of the business that the bank would like to expand—as well as the fact that he is british and softspoken in stark contrast to his american predecessor—mr jenkins’s appointment is not an obvious one</s>
<s>he is almost unknown to the wider public and investment community and is not a comfortable public speaker</s>
<s>moreover retail banking is not as safe a bet as it seems</s>
<s>in britain this part of barclays’ business has underperformed for at least a decade</s>
<s>the bank’s international retail businesses are also struggling</s>
<s>absa its south african subsidiary has suffered a spate of bad loans and its spanish operations are being buffeted by the euro crisis</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>all this suggests that barclays may still have to rely on its investment bank for profits</s>
<s>yet that part of its business will be under pressure too trading of bonds shares and currencies has slumped everywhere denting revenues and regulators are forcing banks to hold much thicker capital cushions in these businesses</s>
<s>mr jenkins may struggle to retain staff at the investment bank if they think it will be shrunk</s>
<s>regaining the trust of those outside the bank while retaining the trust of those who work for it will be a tall order</s>
