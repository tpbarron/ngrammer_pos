<s>“execution execution execution” seems an unfortunate motto at a place where some employees carry guns</s>
<s>fortunately the poster in the reception of securico a firm in zimbabwe’s capital harare is merely a call for excellence</s>
<s>it seems to be working</s>
<s>the company started in 1999 by divine ndhlukula from her kitchen table has become one of the country’s most successful security firms</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ms ndhlukula says competitors were operating like a cartel taking their customers for granted</s>
<s>their employees were unmotivated and strikes were frequent</s>
<s>a 2008 report by the un’s international labour organisation condemned working conditions in much of the country’s security industry which has grown rapidly in response to rising crime</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ms ndhlukula encouraged staff to value their work and trained them well</s>
<s>that has made securico one of zimbabwe’s top three security companies with a turnover that she hopes will exceed $16m this year</s>
<s>thus far securico seems to have achieved its success without drawing any unwelcome attention from zimbabwe’s security forces the enforcers of robert mugabe’s regime</s>
<s>soon it hopes to expand into zambia and other parts of southern africa</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the firm started out just providing guards but has branched out into alarm systems rapidresponse teams cctv and undercover investigations</s>
<s>transporting cash is big business too</s>
<s>when the country still used its own—now worthless—currency the zimbabwe dollar robberies were rare</s>
<s>the sheer volume of notes that had to be stolen to make a crime lucrative was a deterrent</s>
<s>now zimbabwe has adopted the american dollar cash is more enticing and one of securico’s main jobs is schlepping it safely around the country</s>
<s>the firm has yet to be the victim of a heist</s>
<s>for that ms ndhlukula is thankful “you don’t want to run a business where your employees are dying every day” she says wryly</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>at first potential clients would not take seriously a security firm run by a woman</s>
<s>but she has gradually overcome such macho attitudes</s>
<s>today she makes a point of recruiting women</s>
<s>of the company’s 3600 employees 900 are female</s>
<s>women work at every level 70 of the board of directors and half of the senior managers are female</s>
<s>nearly one in three of her “operatives”—the ones that do the dangerous guard work—is a woman</s>
<s>it was tough convincing clients that women could do the grunt work says ms ndhlukula</s>
<s>“i had to really go to town to persuade them” but persuade them she did</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ms ndhlukula chairs the harare branch of zimbabwe’s chamber of commerce</s>
<s>more women some inspired by her are joining she says hoping to set up their own businesses</s>
<s>securico’s success shows that despite the country’s problems it is possible to build a business there even if ms ndhlukula’s achievements also in part reflect zimbabwe’s continuing insecurity</s>
<s>a onestop shop established by the ministry of commerce has made the process a bit easier</s>
<s>she has been lobbying to make it simpler still “it is in the government’s interest to get people to start businesses” she says</s>
<s>and if those new firms’ owners are worried about security ms ndhlukula and her cadre of amazonian sentinels will be there to protect them</s>
