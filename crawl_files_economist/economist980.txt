<s>by most accounts andrius kubilius did a good job as lithuania’s prime minister over the past four years</s>
<s>his policies helped the country weather a steep recession he reined in public expenditure got the country ready to join the euro in a couple of years reformed the energy sector and tried to soften disputes with the neighbours</s>
<s>he even got on with the formidable president dalia grybauskaite</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>even so in the second round of the parliamentary elections on october 28th mr kubilius’s conservative homeland union lost out to the opposition social democrats</s>
<s>having consolidated the opposition vote they won 38 seats in the 141seat seimas with 33 seats for the homeland union</s>
<s>the leftist labour party came third with 29 seats</s>
<s>it was followed by order and justice a populist outfit led by an expresident impeached in 2004 amid a scandal about russian influence which won 11 seats</s>
<s>the conservatives’ junior coalition partners the liberal movement got ten</s>
<s>so algirdas butkevicius the social democrats’ leader looks set to be the next prime minister</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the election came too early for mr kubilius to benefit from a recovery from the painful austerity measures that he imposed when he realised that lithuania risked becoming the baltic greece</s>
<s>after coming to power in 2008 he cut public spending by 30 slashed pensions by 11 and even took a pay cut of 45 himself</s>
<s>he also raised taxes on consumer goods consumption and businesses</s>
<s>gdp plunged and many emigrated</s>
<s>faced with such hard times people yearned for some empathy and warmth from their taskmaster but mr kubilius remained aloof</s>
<s>“he doesn’t cuddle people” says an adviser</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the social democrats’ natural ally in government would be the labour party</s>
<s>its controversial russianborn leader victor uspaskich appeals to poorer and rural voters</s>
<s>during an investigation into his party’s bookkeeping he fled to moscow</s>
<s>the authenticity of his university diploma is contested</s>
<s>he also faces a criminal case involving party finances</s>
<s>the party itself three of its top members and its former accountant are accused of tax evasion and false documentation</s>
<s>he denies everything and says that the proceedings against him are politically motivated</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but his biggest problem is new allegations about his party’s votebuying</s>
<s>in one constituency the results were annulled because of this</s>
<s>the combined effect of all these scandals was that ms grybauskaite in an unprecedented step said that she refused to back a coalition that included labour</s>
<s>under the lithuanian constitution the president appoints the prime minister and can but only with support of the parliament call new elections</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr butkevicius had only one night to celebrate his victory as the president’s veto of his planned coalition with the labour party and order and justice came the day after his victory</s>
<s>he will now have to look at alternatives</s>
<s>none looks durable or attractive</s>
<s>they include a coalition between the social democrats and five small parties such as the liberal movement order and justice and path of courage an outfit fighting an alleged paedophile conspiracy</s>
<s>another option is a socalled rainbow coalition between the social democrats conservatives and liberals</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the leader of the social democrats could also defy the president and go ahead with his original plan</s>
<s>this would give him a tricky start as ms grybauskaite is very popular and very stubborn and a big majority of voters support her refusal to include labour in the government</s>
<s>mr butkevicius may try to compromise by working with labour though without mr uspaskich and his most controversial foot soldiers</s>
<s>the coalition talks could drag on for weeks</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in spite of the standoff between political leaders investors and analysts remain cautiously optimistic about lithuania</s>
<s>the economy is growing again with a 25 expansion forecast for this year and 3 in 2013</s>
<s>based on mr butkevicius’s campaign platform they assume that the government will largely continue to pursue mr kubilius’s successful policies</s>
<s>so does the outgoing prime minister who implored the leftist parties to stay on course</s>
