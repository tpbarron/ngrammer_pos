<s>“jerusalem” jez butterworth’s wild maypole dance around a formidable mark rylance performance crossed the atlantic twice between 2009 and 2011 to rare praise on both sides</s>
<s>since then the talk has been only of what he will do next</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr butterworth’s answer is “the river” a threehander in one act as sparse as its predecessor was sprawling staged in the 90seat upstairs theatre at the royal court in london’s sloane square</s>
<s>tickets are made available only on the morning of each performance</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the synopsis is necessarily vague</s>
<s>on a moonless night an unnamed man has brought an unnamed woman to a cabin by a river</s>
<s>he rhapsodises about fishing</s>
<s>once a year the waters at this spot roil with sea trout</s>
<s>he tells the woman he loves her</s>
<s>he says he has never brought anyone else to this place</s>
<s>yet he seems to be declaring himself to two different women at once</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>past present and future or different shades of past elide in a dreamlike meditation on love and yearning</s>
<s>an excellent cast makes this possible</s>
<s>dominic west “the wire” is skilfully understated as the man</s>
<s>earnest rather than sincere some part of him remains locked away</s>
<s>miranda raison and laura donnelly as the two objects of his affection offer poise and counterpoise one forthright groaning at poetry the other airy and skittish</s>
<s>ian rickson a longtime collaborator of mr butterworth’s directs</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>seven years ago mr butterworth quit london for the country</s>
<s>“walking through woods and by rivers for at least an hour every day” he told the independent has changed the way he writes</s>
<s>this is evident</s>
<s>“the river” is closer and stranger than his previous plays though still very much his</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>mr butterworth makes a singular use of language</s>
<s>in his first successful play “mojo” 1995 a gangster observed how a nightclub “sparkled like the briny deep… like neptune’s cove”</s>
<s>one character in “the night heron” 2002 quoted shelley to an angry mob</s>
<s>here unmoored from the roistering atmosphere of earlier plays the words occasionally feel too precious “a chapel of cloud” a sunset “aquamarine to an iris ring of obsidian”</s>
<s>“the river” is still however a work of quiet wonders</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>theatres mr butterworth believes are “places where…you evoke anxieties and deal with them together” many saw “jerusalem” as a lament for times past</s>
<s>but mr butterworth is not nostalgia’s dupe</s>
<s>he wants change</s>
<s>his latest play cries out for it more keenly than ever</s>
