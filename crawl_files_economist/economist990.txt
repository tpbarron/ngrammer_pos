<s>when stephanie lenz in pennsylvania put a video on youtube of her 18monthold son bopping to prince’s song “let’s go crazy” she did not expect a lawsuit</s>
<s>but four months and 28 views later the musician’s recording company universal howled that the 29second “performance” infringed its copyright and demanded that youtube take it down</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>that was in 2007</s>
<s>since then computers smartphones and the internet have made copyright law look even more obsolete</s>
<s>but the response so far has been not to update the laws but to widen their scope and stiffen the penalties</s>
<s>in january websites including wikipedia briefly shut down in protest against tough antipiracy laws promoted by the entertainment industry in america and elsewhere</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>now the tide is turning</s>
<s>for many politicians property rights for media moguls are taking second place to attempts to boost growth by making life easier for technology companies</s>
<s>ordinary users like ms lenz are getting a lookin too</s>

<s>canada passed a law in june that sets a new standard of permissiveness</s>
<s>it caps statutory damages if copyright is breached for noncommercial purposes</s>
<s>it expands the definition of “fair dealing” “fair use” in america and creates exemptions for educational purposes and for parody</s>
<s>firms must pass warnings about infringement to the person who posted the material rather than immediately take the content down themselves</s>
<s>this contrasts with practice in america and europe where a web company alerted to infringing material must remove it</s>
<s>this encourages kneejerk responses to complaints</s>

<p>
<s>britain too plans to introduce internetfriendly legislation this autumn after a review led by ian hargreaves professor of digital economy at cardiff university</s>
<s>as with canada’s law the recommended new code entails exemptions for noncommercial uses and usergenerated content</s>
<s>also mooted is a “digital copyright exchange” that would establish a marketplace for copyright</s>
<s>a musician could list her song and the licensing terms</s>
<s>a filmmaker wanting to use it would know quickly and simply what to do</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>another innovation is a copyright exemption for companies engaged in text and datamining known as “big data”</s>
<s>at present simply processing data counts as copying even though the end result may not infringe copyright</s>
<s>so a researcher wanting to analyse a medicine’s secondary effects by crunching the results of thousands of studies over the past halfcentury must in theory get permission from each copyright holder</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>ireland and australia are considering an exception that allows content legally obtained on one device to be accessed on another called “format shifting”</s>
<s>without such a provision cloudcomputing and digitalstorage companies could be accused of abetting infringement</s>
<s>the netherlands south korea and india are reviewing their copyright laws too</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the tide is not all one way</s>
<s>eu officials want to maintain rules whereby computer users pay a small tithe on digital products to collection societies</s>
<s>these fees are meant to go to content creators but often end up enriching the middlemen instead</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>a decade ago commercial websites featured nasty lawyerish warnings against copying the content</s>
<s>now many of these same sites sport icons encouraging people to share the content as widely as possible over email facebook or twitter</s>
<s>loosening up may make more money than locking down</s>
