<s>as many pundits have observed bondage is fashionable in publishing circles</s>
<s>so it was no surprise when on october 29th random house and penguin two big publishers announced that they would handcuff themselves to each other</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the book industry has felt more pain than pleasure in the past few years largely thanks to technology</s>
<s>many physical retailers such as borders have shut down after losing out to cheap online sellers particularly amazon</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>in only three years the page has turned for electronic books american publishers generated $21 billion in revenues from them last year up by more than 3200 from 2008 according to bookstats which tracks the industry</s>
<s>in theory ebooks offer better margins because they are cheaper to produce</s>
<s>but publishers fret that customers will soon expect to pay less for all books</s>
<s>that won’t be so good for profits</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>bertelsmann the german company that owns random house and pearson penguin’s parent and a partowner of the economist hope a tieup will give them more clout</s>
<s>combined they will account for around a quarter of englishlanguage book sales</s>
<s>that could help them negotiate better deals with the likes of amazon which sells around 65 of american ebooks according to barclays capital</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>but the main benefit of the merger will come from savings on printing warehouses and distribution which could amount to £100m $161m analysts say</s>
<s>if such savings materialise and they often don’t see article that would free up cash to invest in going digital and experimenting more with selfpublishing platforms a burgeoning business that turns other people’s vanity into cash</s>
<s>they could also save money by squeezing authors</s>
<s>mark oliver of oliver  ohlbaum a consultancy expects penguin random house to cut the number of midlist authors just as music labels once cut mediocre crooners</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>under the terms of the deal pearson must stick around for at least three years but can sell its stake after that to focus on its education business</s>
<s>rupert murdoch whose news corporation owns the book publisher harper collins was interested in buying penguin but he was too late</s>
<s>analysts have long predicted consolidation among the six big book publishers including hachette macmillan and simon  schuster this merger may not be the last</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>the deal should be concluded next year</s>
<s>however there could be twists in the plot</s>
<s>penguin random house needs regulatory approval</s>
<s>but earlier this year america’s department of justice sued apple and five publishers including penguin alleging that they conspired to raise the price of ebooks above what amazon charged</s>
<s>three settled but apple penguin and macmillan are fighting on</s>
<s>a legal battle could complicate antitrust approval</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>and an even greater threat than amazon looms</s>
<s>according to claudio aspesi an analyst at sanford c bernstein a bank the march of penguin and others into digital formats could make them more vulnerable to piracy</s>
<s>ebooks are easy to share by email and speedy to steal it can take around four seconds to download a pirated version of “the help” a novel about servants but over three hours to download the film</s>
<s>if piracy hits publishing like it hit music profits could evaporate he says</s>
<s>here’s hoping for a happier ending</s>
