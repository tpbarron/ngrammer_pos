<p>ALBERTO FUJIMORI won ten years in the presidency by taking a hard line against the leftist guerrillas of the Shining Path. For Peruvians used to seeing him as a strongman, the 74-year-old Mr Fujimori presents a jarring contrast today (see picture). He is serving a 25-year jail sentence for authorising the creation of a death squad, and was hospitalised in August to remove lesions in his mouth he says were caused by cancer.</p>

<p>Mr Fujimori has insisted he would never seek a pardon, since that would imply an admission of guilt. But now that his health is failing and his legal options have run out, his family has put his freedom ahead of their pride. On October 10th his four children asked Ollanta Humala, the president, for a pardon.</p>

<p>Little love has been lost between the Fujimori family and Mr Humala. In 2000 he led a failed military rebellion against Mr Fujimori. Last year he edged out Mr Fujimori’s eldest daughter, Keiko, in a close presidential election. Moreover, Mr Humala’s supporters and his legislative allies oppose a pardon. They have already been disappointed by the president’s shift to the centre in office after running a populist campaign.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the public is inclined to show mercy to Mr Fujimori, though they do not want him back in politics. One poll found that 59% of respondents supported a pardon; another that 70% preferred either a pardon or transferring him to house arrest.</p>

<p>Mr Humala is trying to treat the case as a purely legal matter. Eda Rivas, the justice minister, says she will convene a review board to study the request. The board will surely scrutinise Mr Fujimori’s medical condition: Alan García, Mr Humala’s predecessor, was widely disparaged when a pardon he had granted was revoked because its recipient was not gravely ill. Mr Fujimori’s family says his disease, which he has had since 1997, is being treated but could become more aggressive. The board will also assess whether people convicted of human-rights abuses are eligible for pardons.</p>

<p>In the end, however, the president will have to make a costly political decision. Even behind bars, Mr Fujimori can still trouble his rivals.</p>
