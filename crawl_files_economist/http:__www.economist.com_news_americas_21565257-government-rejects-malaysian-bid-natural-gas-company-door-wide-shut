<p>HOPING to diversify exports away from the United States, the Canadian government has been avidly courting Asian investment in natural-resource industries. When Petronas, Malaysia’s state energy firm, offered C$6 billion ($6 billion) in July for Progress Energy, a producer of unconventional natural gas, the bid appeared tailor-made for the ruling Conservative party. Though Malaysia’s government is mildly authoritarian, it is hardly a political lightning rod like China’s. And Petronas said it would build a useful export terminal for liquefied natural gas on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>So analysts were puzzled when the government announced it would reject the deal, at least for now. Just before the midnight deadline on October 19th the industry ministry issued a terse statement saying the bid did not meet the “net benefit to Canada” standard required by law. Petronas still has 30 days to amend its offer. But even if the firm gets a reprieve, investors are unlikely to forget the episode. Shares in other Canadian resource companies seen as takeover targets fell on the news.</p>

<p>Since the government provided no explanation for its decision, theories abound as to its reasoning. Observers inclined to give Stephen Harper, the prime minister, the benefit of the doubt see the rejection as a tactical sacrifice. As lucrative as the Petronas proposal is, it pales in comparison to the C$15 billion China’s CNOOC has offered for Nexen, a mid-sized oil producer in the western tar sands. The government has gone to great lengths to woo Chinese capital, and last month the two countries signed an investment-protection treaty.</p>

<p>However, polls show that most Canadians oppose takeovers by state-run firms in natural-resource industries. By at least delaying the Petronas tie-up, the government may hope to build up credibility with the public that it could later spend on the CNOOC-Nexen deal. It has also insulated itself from charges of an anti-China bias. A decision is due before November 12th.</p>

<p>A less charitable view is that the Conservatives lack a policy. They approved the sales of two leading mining firms and Canada’s biggest aluminium producer to foreigners in 2006-07, but blocked a deal with BHP Billiton, an Australian mining giant, for a potash company in 2010. On October 22nd Mr Harper promised to issue new guidelines “in the not-too-distant future …regarding these sorts of transactions.” Investors and voters await them eagerly.</p>
