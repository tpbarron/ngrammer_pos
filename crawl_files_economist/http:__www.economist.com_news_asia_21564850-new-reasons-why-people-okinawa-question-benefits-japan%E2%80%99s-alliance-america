<p>COMMANDERS of the 26,000 or so American troops based in Okinawa feel cursed by bad luck. For their part, many of the 1.4m Okinawans feel cursed by the Americans themselves. The arrest and charging of two American sailors for the alleged rape of a local woman comes at an awkward moment. Okinawa had already seen an upsurge in protests against the American bases, prompted by the deployment this month at the Futenma airbase in Ginowan city of 12 MV-22 Osprey aircraft, which take off and land like a helicopter but fly like a fixed-wing aeroplane.</p>

<p>In the view of one protester, this brings “the world’s most dangerous aircraft to the world’s most dangerous base”. The Americans dispute both halves of that accusation, and deny that their soldiers are more likely to commit a crime than anyone else on the island. Yet the rape allegations will only add fuel to local fury.</p>

<p>In the case of the Ospreys, the bad luck came in the form of accidents in Florida and Morocco earlier this year. These strengthened what the Americans again say is an unfair impression that they are unsafe. The marines say the aircraft have a better safety record than most of their aeroplanes and regard them as a huge boost to their capabilities in Okinawa. They replace an ageing fleet of Sea Knight helicopters with craft of twice the speed, three times the payload and four times the range.</p>

<p>Okinawa is the main island in what used to be called the Ryukyu chain, which Japan annexed in the 19th century, extending Japanese territory by over 1,000km (620 miles) to the south-west towards Taiwan. The island is central to the security alliance between Japan and the United States, and home to two-thirds of American troops in Japan. As America “pivots” its global military strategy to Asia, Okinawa, in the “first island chain” between China and the open ocean, and within reach of potential trouble in the Taiwan Strait and, to the north, the Korean peninsula, is as well-situated as ever.</p>

<p>Moreover, America’s treaty promises to defend Japan if it is attacked appear more than theoretical just now. It still seems almost inconceivable that the current row with China over the tiny, uninhabited, Japanese-administered Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyus in Chinese, will lead to war. But a reason for that is America’s assurance that the treaty covers the islands.</p>

<p>An independent assessment of America’s Pacific strategy, commissioned by the Pentagon and published in August by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think-tank in Washington, described the “core strategic bargain” in the treaty: America provides security, while Japan provides access to bases. So there is reason for the Japanese government to worry about growing resentment in Okinawa.</p>

<p>At Futenma’s gates a dwindling band of mostly elderly anti-Osprey protesters gathers daily, the remnants of a movement that saw a 100,000-strong demonstration last month. One protester is 67, as old as the American presence, which he has been struggling against since 1982, when some landowners tried not to extend leases on lots inside American bases. He became more involved after the gang-rape in 1995 of a 12-year-old girl by three American marines. He demonstrated again in 2004 when a helicopter crashed (without any loss of life) in a university outside Futenma.</p>

<p>The Ospreys, and now the alleged rape, have rekindled old grudges and sparked new anger. Susumu Matayoshi, director of the office of Okinawa’s governor, guesses that the Ospreys are opposed by 80-90% of the population, including even staunch supporters of the treaty. The local worry stems in part from the uncomfortable topography of Futenma itself. Thanks to development, Ginowan now surrounds it entirely.</p>

<p>In 1996 America and Japan agreed to relocate Futenma, and in 2006 they settled on a new location, at Henoko, in the less populated north-east of the island. The CSIS report thought Futenma the “best location on Okinawa”, with Henoko the best of other options, suggesting the delay is of little concern to the Americans. But Christopher Owens, the general commanding the aircraft wing at Futenma, thinks the move to a base facing fewer restrictions would be preferable.</p>

<p>At one point it even seemed feasible. But in 2009 the new government of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) said it wanted to shift the base off Okinawa altogether. The DPJ later recanted. But by then local opinion had hardened against the new base. So difficult is the relocation that in April America and Japan agreed to unlink it from other parts of their 2006 agreement—the return of other bases in the south of Okinawa and the relocation of 9,000 marines from Futenma to Guam. But both are long-term projects, mired in delays of their own.</p>

<p>Far away and easy to ignore</p>

<p>Okinawans, who suffered terribly as American and Japanese troops battled at the end of the second world war, have long been promised an easing of their “burden” of playing host to the bases that have been there ever since. Instead the Ospreys and the rape accusation offer new reasons for anger. In Tokyo politicians pay lip-service to their concerns, but seem to believe they can be bought off. One DPJ politician sees the timing of the Ospreys’ arrival as a godsend. It greatly enhances deterrence towards China in the Senkakus—which are within range of the Ospreys, but not the Sea Knights. And it coincides with real threats to Japan’s security, when some Chinese hint at a territorial claim to the whole Ryukyu chain, which should soften opposition.</p>

<p>In the governor’s office Mr Matayoshi thought this argument a “huge leap of logic”, even before the rape allegations, which will drown out local press coverage of incursions around the Senkakus by Chinese warships. It all helps explain why one of the younger protesters at Futenma says that, when she and her friends get together over a beer, conversation soon turns to distant dreams of Okinawan independence.</p>
