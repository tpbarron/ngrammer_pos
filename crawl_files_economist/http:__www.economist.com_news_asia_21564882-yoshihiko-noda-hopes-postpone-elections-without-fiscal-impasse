<p>BY RIGHTS, Yoshihiko Noda, Japan’s prime minister, does not need to convene a new session of the Diet, or parliament, until January. The temptation to wait seems obvious. His ruling block has a shaky eight-seat majority in the 480-seat lower house. Only when the Diet is in session can his opponents gather enough votes to depose him.</p>

<p>Yet a budget problem looms which the opposition hopes will force his hand. Compared with America’s, Japan’s immediate fiscal woes are more of a steep slope than a cliff. Earlier this year the lower house of the Diet approved the 2012-13 budget, but both houses have to pass a bill authorising the issue of ¥38.3 trillion ($490 billion) of bonds to cover its huge deficit. This the upper house, controlled by the opposition, has so far refused to do. It is angry at what the biggest opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), sees as Mr Noda’s broken promise some months back to call a general election “soon.”</p>

<p>A game of brinkmanship is therefore in play, one that alarms the Ministry of Finance, long the arbiter of fiscal rectitude. The ministry warns of a crisis of confidence in one of the world’s biggest bond markets. The chances of such a crisis, its officials say, will rise if no financing bill is approved by November, when the government will start to run out of money.</p>

<p>In theory the prime minister has wiggle room. For instance, the government might issue short-term financial bills instead of longer-term bonds to tide it over—provided, the law stipulates, there is confidence that by March 31st, the end of the fiscal year, investors will be repaid. Yet the longer the bill authorising the deficit-financing bonds is delayed, the greater is the risk that a rush of bonds issued at the end of the fiscal year will swamp the market. So a passage of the bill in November is much to be preferred.</p>

<p>Knowing this, Mr Noda is probably keen to pass the bill soon. In return for its co-operation, the opposition will demand that he promises to dissolve the Diet in November. The election would then be held in early December.</p>

<p>Mr Noda would probably lose. The prime minister’s popularity, according to the latest polls, is below that of the LDP’s new leader, Shinzo Abe. Mr Noda has alienated voters with flip-flops over nuclear power and a bill to raise the consumption tax that partially ruptured his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Mr Noda’s chief hope is that the shine quickly comes off Mr Abe. A prime minister once before, in 2006-07, Mr Abe stepped down because of illness and government blunders. He remains controversial, not least because he holds provocatively nationalistic views: on October 17th he visited Tokyo’s Yasukuni shrine, which honours war criminals among Japan’s war dead. (Neither the DPJ nor the LDP is likely to be popular enough to govern without alliances, whoever wins the election.)</p>

<p>Another obstacle may also have to be overcome before any election. The Supreme Court has declared the electoral system to be unconstitutional, because it gives too much voting power to rural constituencies in the lower house at the expense of urban voters. On October 14th the DPJ’s secretary-general, Azuma Koshiishi, suggested the party was prepared to go along with LDP proposals to scrap five of the offending single-seat constituencies in the lower house, without demanding a wider electoral reform. Yet even with such an agreement, it is not clear how long it would take to draw up new boundaries.</p>

<p>It all points to ways in which Mr Noda might hang on to power beyond December, though probably for no more than a month or two. In the meantime, however, the parliament would remain paralysed, with little Mr Noda could do to exercise power. That then would give an excuse to the opposition to propose a vote of no confidence. It remains eight votes short of victory. But for how long?</p>
