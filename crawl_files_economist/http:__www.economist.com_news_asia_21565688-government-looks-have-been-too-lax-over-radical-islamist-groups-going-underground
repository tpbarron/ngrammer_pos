<p>UNTIL late last month the Sunni Movement for Indonesian Society was just another of the country’s many small obscure conservative Islamist organisations. All that changed on October 26th-27th, when Indonesia’s elite counter-terrorism unit arrested 11 members of the group, locally known as HASMI, during raids in four separate cities across Java, Indonesia’s most populous island. Officers found several ready-to-go bombs and a list of targets that included the American embassy in the capital, Jakarta, the American consulate in Surabaya in East Java, and the Jakarta offices of Freeport-McMoRan, an American mining giant.</p>

<p>Police say the bombing plot was driven by anger at an amateurish American anti-Muslim film, “Innocence of Muslims”, that recently inflamed parts of the Muslim world. But Indonesia’s counter-terrorism chief, Ansyaad Mbai, says that HASMI members have links to Jemaah Islamiah, the South-East Asian franchise of al-Qaeda which has carried out several deadly attacks in Indonesia, including bombings in Bali in 2002 that killed 202 people, many of them foreign holidaymakers. HASMI leaders deny police claims that it is a terrorist group, insisting that the organisation is non-violent and has existed peacefully for decades.</p>

<p>Yet the arrest of the 11 has fed growing concerns. The raids were just the latest in a string of arrests for terrorism-related offences of members of Islamist mass organisations, all registered and legally sanctioned. In September counter-terrorism authorities claimed that several terrorist cells uncovered in Indonesia this year had links to Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid, one of the country’s most visible Islamic organisations. The group’s founder, Abu Bakar Basyir, is the reputed spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah and is currently serving 15 years in prison for setting up a jihadi training camp in Aceh province. HASMI itself is also allegedly linked to the country’s most notorious radical Islamist group, the Islamic Defenders Front. But it, too, is legally sanctioned.</p>

<p>Terrorism analysts in Indonesia warn that members of above-ground radical Islamist groups are going underground to engage in acts of terror, or at least to train for them. They pin much of the blame for this on the country’s president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. For the past three or so years, his government and police force have done little as increasingly emboldened radical groups have launched violent and sometimes deadly attacks on minority sects, notably Shiites and Ahmadi Muslims—an Ahmadiyah mosque in West Java was vandalised on October 25th. Christian churches have also been burnt or forcibly closed.</p>

<p>Indonesia has earned a reputation as one of the most successful countries in the world at combating terrorism since September 11th 2001, with hundreds of arrests and convictions. But with increasing numbers of “legal” radicals going underground to join or form terrorist cells, that reputation is now in jeopardy.</p>
