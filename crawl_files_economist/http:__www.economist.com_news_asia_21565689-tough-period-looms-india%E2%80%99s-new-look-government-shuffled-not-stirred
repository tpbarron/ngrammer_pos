<p>AT A swish Delhi party under a full moon this week, a clutch of parliamentarians flitted gaily around a newly promoted young minister. By a palm tree a senior cabinet figure looked on, smiling. It was a natural moment to celebrate, right after October 28th, when Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, reshuffled 22 ministers. Yet soon the cheerful mood may give way to growing trepidation over the difficult months ahead.</p>

<p>Pressure on the prime minister for a reshuffle had grown during a year which has seen relations sour between the Congress Party and some coalition allies. Mamata Banerjee, the Bengali chief minister, flounced out of government in September over new economic reforms. A Tamil ally, the DMK, has sulked all year, refusing to fill two ministerial posts because its leading figures have been punished for graft.</p>

<p>The government is not about to fall, but it has grown wobbly. Mr Singh hopes this will be his last ministerial rejig before a general election due by mid-2014, at which point he will presumably retire. That leaves precious little time for his new ministers—and the vote may loom even sooner, Delhi gossip holds. The government survives thanks to two parties from populous Uttar Pradesh. Either one could pull away if, say, a really big scandal rendered association with Congress too distasteful.</p>

<p>Mr Singh and his political boss, Sonia Gandhi, intended several things with his shake-up. Lifting younger figures to more senior posts is designed to give his grey-haired government a more energetic look. Do the sums, however, and the average age of a cabinet minister comes down by only a few months, to 64-and-a-bit years. By elevating a host of figures from Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, Mr Singh may have bolstered Congress’s profile in those states. But he also signals a certain panic about the party’s electoral prospects there.</p>

<p>The most prominent change is in promoting Salman Khurshid, formerly law minister, to be foreign minister. That he is only the third Muslim to take the post in India’s history was met, literally, with a shrug this week by Pakistan’s high commissioner to Delhi. But Mr Khurshid is bright and is reckoned to be more capable than his creaky predecessor, S.M. Krishna.</p>

<p>Yet even Mr Khurshid’s appointment brings with it a dash of controversy for a government heavily tainted by graft. Mr Khurshid had stoutly to deny recent allegations of misuse, or at least mismanagement, of official funds by a charity for the disabled run by his wife in Uttar Pradesh. He is joined in government by Shashi Tharoor, who got a junior ministerial post. A smooth politician, he had been forced to quit as a minister in 2010 over a cricket corruption scandal involving his now wife.</p>

<p>Their promotions mean the new-look government will find it no easier than the old one to rebut gleeful opposition gibes over corruption. In any case a new, very sensitive, controversy erupted on October 31st, when an anti-graft activist, Arvind Kejriwal, accused Congress of doing the bidding of Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. Mr Kejriwal claims the party appoints oil ministers friendly to the interests of India’s richest man.</p>

<p>Nor can Mr Singh claim a vote of confidence from one of Congress’s most prominent figures: Rahul Gandhi. The scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which dominates the ruling party, again refused an offer of office, opting instead for more party work. That looks slightly masochistic. A series of state-assembly polls will pit Congress against the chief opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, beginning in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh in December. Congress is likely to find itself repeatedly bruised over the coming year.</p>

<p>Still, he and his mother, Mrs Gandhi, have evidently calculated that serving in an unpopular government would be worse, even if it means that Mr Gandhi continues to miss out on ministerial experience. All in all, it may be easiest for Mr Gandhi to join high politics as the head of a Congress Party that finds itself, after the general election, in opposition.</p>

<p>In the end Congress’s fortunes will probably rest less on corruption or on the personalities in government than on the country’s economic performance. On this, the central bank offered no help this week. Concerned about inflation, it refused, again, to cut the main interest rate, even as it forecast that growth will slow this year, to under 6%.</p>

<p>In other words, the central bank is unconvinced that Mr Singh’s team has got public spending and a gaping fiscal deficit in hand. The prospect may be for yet slower economic growth, just as India’s ruling politicians raise their eyes towards a looming general election.</p>
