<p>AS THIS correspondent stood at the windswept border post of Islam Qala, 300 Afghans poured off Iranian buses and trudged back into Afghanistan. Every day 1,000-odd Afghans return this way from jobs they once had in Iran.</p>

<p>Afghans have long toiled illegally in factories and on building sites after being smuggled across the desert into Iran. Life as an illegal worker was hard, returning Afghans say. The police persecuted them and their bosses cheated them. But it was worth the trouble for the wages sent back to families in villages with no work for young men.</p>

<p>Now Afghans are flooding home. Economic mismanagement and Western sanctions have led to a collapse in the Iranian rial, which has fallen by two-thirds in the past year. Afghans are now “working for nothing” says 27-year-old Abdullah Mohammad, as he boards a bus to nearby Badghis province after spending nine months in Tehran.</p>

<p>Western Afghanistan is suffering, too. The region is dominated by its neighbour. Herat, 75 miles (120 kilometres) from the Iranian border, was an exception among Afghan cities in that it thrived without the NATO war dollars that course through Kabul, the capital, and Kandahar in the south. As NATO combat troops prepare to leave in 2014, the city should be a beacon for the Afghan economy. Its canny businessmen have prospered on cross-border trade, and the city is pleasant and tidy with parks and boulevards that are the envy of the rest of Afghanistan. The post at Islam Qala provides a fifth of national customs revenues.</p>

<p>Now traders say that a cloud hangs over Herat. Merchants are stuck with piles of worthless rials. Supplies of the raw materials that feed Herat’s light industries are drying up. Prices of staples in the bazaar are rising sharply. This month Herat’s businessmen suffered another blow when Iran announced an export ban on 52 products, from wheat to sugar and aluminium. After a crisis meeting on November 4th the Herat chamber of commerce urged the Afghan government to ask Iran to relent. A backup plan to ask for Western help instead seems highly fanciful.</p>
