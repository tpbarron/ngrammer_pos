<p>Events, Dear Boy, Events: A Political Diary of Britain from Woolf to Campbell. Edited by Ruth Winstone. Profile; 680 pages; £25. Buy from Amazon.co.uk </p>

<p>RUTH WINSTONE’S job is to pry into people’s diaries. She has edited the journals of Chris Mullin, a backbench member of Parliament with a wry eye and remarkable ears. She edited nine volumes of Tony Benn’s logs. Now she has produced a history of Britain from 1921 to 2010 solely using diaries, and there is much to enjoy in it. Virginia Woolf dismisses “Ulysses”: “an illiterate, underbred book it seems to me.” Sir Noel Coward is confused by John Osborne’s “Look Back in Anger”, the celebrated play of the 1950s. “It is so full of talent and fairly well constructed but I wish I knew why the hero is so dreadfully cross and what about?”</p>

<p>There is a wonderful sketch of Sir Winston Churchill, whose photo is taken unawares. Cecil Beaton, the official war photographer, records: “The following would be an interpretation of the barks, wheezes and grunts that turned my blood cold: ‘Hey damn you, young fellow, what the hell are you up to with your monkey tricks? Stop all this nonsense! I hate candid camera photographs! Wait till I’m prepared: the glass of port taken away, my spectacles so—this box shut, the papers put away thus—now then—I’m ready, but don’t try any cleverness on me!’ The PM settled himself and stared into my camera like a bulldog guarding its kennel. Click!”</p>

<p>Part of the joy comes from parallels with the present. Ms Winstone picks out the following from Violet Bonham Carter, a Liberal, as she worries about her party’s prospects: “The alternative [to electoral defeat] would be a deal over seats with the Tories with PR as a condition and an agreed programme. I shouldn’t like it and it might split the party and give the left wing to Labour.” But, she says in 1947, she fears complete parliamentary extinction.</p>

<p>The change in values is always amusing. Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, records in 1962: “The doctors have come out with a tremendous report on the dangers of smoking—esp cigarettes. This puts us in rather a fix. For how are we to get £800m indirect revenue from any other source?” Richard Crossman, a Labour intellectual, bemoans the “extremely unpleasant” bill legalising gay sex—the “Buggers’ Bill” as he calls it. “It may well be 20 years ahead of public opinion; certainly working-class people in the north jeer at their members at the weekend and ask them why they’re looking after the buggers at Westminster instead of looking after the unemployed at home.”</p>

<p>Many of the greatest diarists are self- absorbed failures who watch the powerful with envy and occasional cattiness. Mr Mullin and Mr Benn, and also Alan Clark, the finest parliamentary diarist of the century, all fit this description. Gyles Brandreth’s diaries are surprisingly entertaining, even when he parodies himself: “Gyles Brandreth, would-be home secretary, has had lunch with Barbie Buss, editor of Woman magazine…I am their new ‘star’,” he writes with glee.</p>

<p>Some diaries merit reading simply out of their oddness. John Reith’s are a delight. As director-general of the BBC, with a mission “to purify the life of the nation”, he frowns on politics. “I reflect sometimes on ‘politics’. The whole horrid technique should be abolished.” He calls political talks on the radio, “a prostitution of broadcasting”. But he hankers for power. He lets slip that he would like to be minister of defence, hoping it will be passed on. Churchill, then chancellor of the exchequer, tells Reith he thinks the head of the BBC has the biggest job in the country. Particularly stirring is the story of his job interview. “I hadn’t the remotest idea as to what broadcasting was and I hadn’t troubled to find out,” he says. They took him anyway.</p>

<p>These gems provide instant, private thoughts to changing events. A book like this one that Ms Winstone has so carefully curated may be the last of its kind; tweets and blogs are steadily taking over. More folk are writing as a result. But diaries are different. Full of stories, sneers, passions and dreams, they make a greater mark on history than a tweet.</p>
