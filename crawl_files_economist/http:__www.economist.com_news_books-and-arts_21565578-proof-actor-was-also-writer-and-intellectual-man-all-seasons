<p>RICHARD BURTON’S diaries, published in full for the first time 28 years after his death, show a man who was far more than an actor obsessed and twice married to an Oscar-winning Hollywood icon. What the diaries contain is neatly summed up by his editor, Chris Williams, a Welsh academic: “the melancholic, afflicted, troubled and introspective Burton struggling to come to terms with the missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential of his life and talent…justly proud of his achievements, of his journey in life, hungry to scale greater heights…watching his weight, watching his drinking, watching other men watching his Elizabeth. We have a Richard Burton who reads, who thinks, who longs to write…”</p>

<p>Born Richard Jenkins in a Glamorgan mining valley, the sixth son of a collier, he was brought up from the age of two by a sister 20 years his senior after his mother died. In his teens his academic prowess attracted the attention of an English teacher named Philip Burton. Legal guardianship followed and at 18 Richard Jenkins became Richard Burton.</p>

<p>His teenage diaries mostly record daily doings: had a bath, had a haircut, saw a film. Diary writing properly gets going in mid-1965. Aged 40, he marries Elizabeth Taylor after a public romance that began in Rome on the set of “Cleopatra”. He learns to hate the paparazzi, especially the English. “They’re so smirky and sneaky and smug and provincial. They are not honestly scandalous with the awful dirty pornographic glee of the Italians. They are merely snide.”</p>

<p>Burton’s voracious intellectual interests are a revelation. Discovering Proust, he vows to read the original French alongside Scott Moncrieff’s translation. When Taylor is sick he alternates detective stories with Michael Holroyd’s life of Lytton Strachey—“what a vile, cruel, self-centred man”.</p>

<p>When Pablo Neruda wins the Nobel prize in literature in 1971 he admits to his ignorance of the man, confessing that he “never really understands the poetry of another language”. This gets him musing on the Nobel and its “hilarious awards”, not least its peace prize to Churchill. “Never has a politician, despite his outraged protestations, loved war as much as the old man.” [Burton, like many people, mistakenly believed that Churchill won the peace prize. In fact, he was awarded the Nobel prize in literature in 1953.] Burton died at 59, leaving only these diaries to show his undoubted talent for writing. The loss is all the reader’s.</p>
