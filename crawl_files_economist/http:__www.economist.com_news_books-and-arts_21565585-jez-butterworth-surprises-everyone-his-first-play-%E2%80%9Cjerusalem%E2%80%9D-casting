<p>“JERUSALEM”, Jez Butterworth’s wild maypole dance around a formidable Mark Rylance performance, crossed the Atlantic twice between 2009 and 2011, to rare praise on both sides. Since then, the talk has been only of what he will do next.</p>

<p>Mr Butterworth’s answer is “The River”, a three-hander in one act, as sparse as its predecessor was sprawling, staged in the 90-seat upstairs theatre at the Royal Court in London’s Sloane Square. Tickets are made available only on the morning of each performance.</p>

<p>The synopsis is necessarily vague. On a moonless night, an unnamed man has brought an unnamed woman to a cabin by a river. He rhapsodises about fishing. Once a year the waters at this spot roil with sea trout. He tells the woman he loves her. He says he has never brought anyone else to this place. Yet he seems to be declaring himself to two different women at once.</p>

<p>Past, present and future, or different shades of past, elide in a dreamlike meditation on love and yearning. An excellent cast makes this possible. Dominic West (“The Wire”) is skilfully understated as the man. Earnest rather than sincere, some part of him remains locked away. Miranda Raison and Laura Donnelly, as the two objects of his affection, offer poise and counterpoise: one forthright, groaning at poetry; the other airy and skittish. Ian Rickson, a longtime collaborator of Mr Butterworth’s, directs.</p>

<p>Seven years ago Mr Butterworth quit London for the country. “Walking through woods and by rivers for at least an hour every day,” he told the Independent, has changed the way he writes. This is evident. “The River” is closer and stranger than his previous plays, though still very much his.</p>

<p>Mr Butterworth makes a singular use of language. In his first successful play, “Mojo” (1995), a gangster observed how a nightclub “sparkled like the briny deep… like Neptune’s cove”. One character in “The Night Heron” (2002) quoted Shelley to an angry mob. Here, unmoored from the roistering atmosphere of earlier plays, the words occasionally feel too precious: “a chapel of cloud”, a sunset “aquamarine to an iris ring of obsidian”. “The River” is still, however, a work of quiet wonders.</p>

<p>Theatres, Mr Butterworth believes, are “places where…you evoke anxieties and deal with them together.” Many saw “Jerusalem” as a lament for times past. But Mr Butterworth is not nostalgia’s dupe. He wants change. His latest play cries out for it more keenly than ever.</p>
