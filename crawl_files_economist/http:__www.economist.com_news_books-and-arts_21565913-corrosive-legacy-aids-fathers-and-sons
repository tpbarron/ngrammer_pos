<p>The Scientists: A Family Romance. By Marco Roth. Farrar, Straus & Giroux; 196 pages; $23. Buy from Amazon.com</p>

<p>MARCO ROTH cannot quite recall how his father told him he was dying of AIDS. In one memory his father interrupts a televised baseball game; in another he delivers the news as a bedtime story. Each version is hazy, but all feature the same account: his father contracted HIV in his science lab after being accidentally stuck by the needle of a diseased blood donor. This moment of bad luck sentenced him to years of illness, his slow death haunting the quietly unhappy but otherwise privileged Manhattan home he shared with his wife and only child. The virus would be the family’s secret.</p>

<p>All families have their secrets, but this one was toxic—oppressive at home and isolating from everyone else. Some suggest that all sons want to kill their fathers, but few would care to witness a steady, sickly, insidious demise. As a thoughtful youth with a literary bent, Mr Roth’s relationship with his father was fraught. In death, the man casts an even more troubling shadow. In part this is because the story of his father’s infection may have been hiding an even darker secret, a lifetime of subterfuge and sexual frustration. The mystery of the elder Roth’s life lies at the heart of “The Scientists”. Circuitous, elegant and fiercely intelligent, this memoir is Mr Roth’s attempt to understand his father’s character in order to better know his own.</p>

<p>An anxious child of Jewish intellectuals, Mr Roth learned to view love as something like the God of the Old Testament: aggressive and impatient, both demanding and remote. Like a millstone, he has carried his father’s temper and contempt into his own botched projects—a failed marriage and an abandoned PhD, a lifetime of discomfort and dislocation. With the patience of the literary scholar he almost became, he pores over his father’s favourite novels (a “canon of disappointment and unhappiness”) in search of clues about the man. Some of the book’s richest moments are when Mr Roth uses the works of Franz Kafka and Thomas Mann to grasp sadly and lovingly at his father’s cryptic ghost.</p>

<p>All memoirs are, in their way, works of therapy; opportunities to air grievances and cauterise wounds. So it is with this sentimental and confused journey, which offers no big revelations or pat conclusions. But with the wisdom of a good reader and the humility of a lost soul, Mr Roth sorts through the mess of his past—in order to plot his escape from it.</p>
