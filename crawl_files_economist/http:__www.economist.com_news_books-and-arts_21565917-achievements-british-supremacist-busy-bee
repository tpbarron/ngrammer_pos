<p>ABDULLAH, their secretary or munshi, was astounded by the constant activity. He marvelled at how Stamford and Olivia Raffles did not, like normal people, remain at rest until something came up that had to be done. They finished one apparently self-imposed task and immediately turned to another, and with massive consequences.</p>

<p>As Victoria Glendinning shows, it was hyperactive adults like these who hacked an empire out of the jungles of Asia. In defiance of the maxim of his East India Company bosses, “trade not territory”, Raffles jousted for British supremacy against the Dutch in the Far East, founded the future city-state of Singapore and, where his writ ran, freed slaves, banned cock fighting, supported smallpox vaccination drives and abolished cruel punishments.</p>

<p>Ms Glendinning catches the nuances of early 19th-century English, which she obviously adores. A clerk says he’s “doggedly contented”. Another clerk describes a colleague as “one of the most pert, assuming, and forward coxcombs I ever saw”. Raffles is praised for his “unwearied zeal and assiduity”. Abdullah, a translator as well as a secretary, writes of the Raffles’ marriage that they were “of one mind, like a ruler and his minister, like a ring and the jewel set in it, like sugar in milk”.</p>

<p>The author is also magnificent on the customs and manners of the time. Officials of the East India Company splutter in furious exchanges of letters about their salaries or job titles. Wives snub those they deem of lower status, campaign against spittoons and bare feet, and struggle to stay composed while they witness fights to the death between tigers and buffaloes staged by native rulers to honour their husbands.</p>

<p>Life out there was hazardous for them, too. Olivia died within ten years of her marriage to Raffles. Sophia, his second wife, wore a gold bracelet with five small lockets attached to it. Each locket contained a scrap of hair from one of their children. Before she and Raffles boarded a ship back to England four of them were dead. That ship, the Fame, caught fire and sank with all their belongings, and they were lucky to escape with their lives.</p>

<p>By then Raffles was known as a scholar as well as an adventurer. It was, as Ms Glendinning recalls, an age when “culture was unitary”, with little division between science and the arts and religion. Raffles learned local languages and collected artefacts. On the tropical islands he explored he studied animals and birds as well as plants. He even found time to write “The History of Java”, a book that has had lasting value as source material for historians.</p>

<p>Sophia’s firm Christian faith sustained her. Raffles often felt worn out. He was only 37 when he said in a family letter “as I advance in age, retirement becomes more and more congenial to me.” Yet when he returned to England a few years later he still had the energy to help found the Zoological Society and to aid William Wilberforce’s ambition to build St Mary’s, Mill Hill, a glorious London church. By honing in on such a great life for her first non-literary biography Ms Glendinning is in danger of giving imperialism a good name.</p>
