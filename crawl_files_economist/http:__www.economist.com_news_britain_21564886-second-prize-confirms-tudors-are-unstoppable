<p>MOUNTING the podium in London’s Guildhall to receive her second Man Booker prize on October 16th, Hilary Mantel mused on the delayed gratification of a writer’s life. “You wait 20 years for a Booker prize and two come along at once,” she joked. Granting the award, which attempts to single out the best novel published in the English-speaking world, to “Bring Up the Bodies” raised some eyebrows. Ms Mantel won the trophy only three years ago, for “Wolf Hall”, the first book in what will be a trilogy. The new entry in the series beat more adventurous contenders, including a novel about psychotherapy and modernism and the tale of a Mumbai opium den. It confirms the revival of historical fiction, and seals the Tudors’ cultural victory.</p>

<p>Ms Mantel’s recipe for handling the intrigue, fear and opulence of life with a monarch by turns amiable, sex-addicted and murderous is to ditch the sub-Shakespearean prose which plagues much historical fiction. No one in her book says “Fie thee, Sir.” Bodices remain unripped. We hear of sexual intrigue through the gossip of others and the prism of their interests. In this account of Henry VIII’s transition from wife number two (Anne Boleyn) to meek Jane Seymour, the language is plain and pointed. “How many wives does the man want?” muses Thomas Cromwell, the exasperated chief minister, combining raison d’état with the guileful self-interest of the political aide.</p>

<p>Cromwell is the axis of the series. Ms Mantel has done much to rehabilitate a man rendered in “A Man for All Seasons”, the popular 1960s film, as a self-aggrandising control freak. She is influenced by Geoffrey Elton, a historian who saw Henry’s chief minister as the founder of the modern British state. Indeed, the novelist might qualify as Cromwell’s posthumous spin-doctor. Her protagonist is an early supporter of the redistributive welfare system. Cromwell taxes the rich to finance the king’s lavish lifestyle (all those wives take some keeping) but also raises levies to aid the poor.</p>

<p>Historical novels resonate when they bring the past to life while nodding to the mood and concerns of the present. Some critics have seen in “Bring up the Bodies”, with its summary disappearances and the “sweat of fear”, echoes of today’s anxieties about renditions of terror suspects and other state excesses. Ms Mantel is a more subtle weaver of moods and references across time: from the pitiful treatment of discarded women to the rivalries, great and small, of office politics.</p>

<p>Her subject matter is also commercially savvy. “Wolf Hall” was a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic, making more than £5m ($8m) for its British publishers. And to judge by the interest in biographies of Henry’s court from writers like Alison Weir, David Starkey and Antonia Fraser, as well as a lavishly tacky TV series chronicling the sex and violence of the inhabitants, those wily Tudors still command the imaginations of the second Elizabethan age.</p>
