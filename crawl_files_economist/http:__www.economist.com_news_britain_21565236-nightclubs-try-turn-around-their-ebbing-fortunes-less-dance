<p>LOVERS of thumping music and human sweat are growing scarcer. A third of nightclubs have shut in the past five years. The market value of the industry has fallen from £1.8 billion ($3.6 billion) to £1.4 billion since 2007, according to Mintel, a consultancy. The biggest nightclub firm, Luminar, which owns Oceana and Liquid clubs, went into administration last October. Old hands saved it, buying 66 of its 79 venues in December; only 55 remain open.</p>

<p>Youngsters drink less often, and frequently “pre-drink” when they do, guzzling cheap supermarket booze before going out. The average customer now quaffs just 1.8 drinks at Luminar’s clubs. A change in the licensing laws has also dented sales. Before 2005 clubs had few rivals after 11pm, when most pubs closed. They had “a licence to print money,” admits Aaron Mellor of Tokyo clubs. Many pubs now offer alcohol later.</p>

<p>The economic downturn has made things worse. Borrowing is trickier, and jobless and cash-strapped youths are less likely to go out. Universities, which supply many clubbers, have stopped expanding. A club with 100 fewer people than it can hold feels empty, says Jon Collins, head of CGA Strategy, a nightclub consultancy—“and who wants to return to an empty club?”</p>

<p>Club owners have turned to social media to stave off decline. They recruit promoters—the young and popular, mostly—to post links to their club nights. “Guaranteed banger tonight,” writes one. Friends can add their names to a list for discounts. After a night out, photos of revellers appear on friends’ Facebook feeds, branded with the club’s logo. Peter Marks, head of Luminar, says 1.2m people view these pictures every month.</p>

<p>The best clubs now offer comedy, live music and food in the day, says Michael Oliver of Mintel. But this is not an option for some. Sound systems necessitate thick walls and few windows, which does not make for an attractive dining space. Mr Marks says he gained little when his clubs offered comedy gigs and food. Salvation may eventually come from a new floor-filling pop-music genre. But nobody can will that into being.</p>
