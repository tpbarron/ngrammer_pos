<p>Britain has seldom beat such a humiliating retreat in the face of superior numbers. On October 23rd the government suspended a controversial plan to cull badgers in two areas of south-west England after it emerged that twice as many lived there as it had thought. The marksmen hired to carry out the slaughter, which was intended to contain the spread of bovine tuberculosis, were to be paid per badger killed. Thus, in austerity Britain, the scheme was unaffordable. This was welcomed by animal-rights activists, including Brian May, a guitarist, and some scientists, who had questioned what good the cull would do. It disappointed farmers, who were forced to slaughter 26,000 infected cattle last year and, quite possibly, manufacturers of old-fashioned shaving brushes.</p>
