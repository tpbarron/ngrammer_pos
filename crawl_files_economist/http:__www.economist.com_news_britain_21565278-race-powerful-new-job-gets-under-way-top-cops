<p>THE average age of the audience looked well north of 40 at the hustings where six candidates for Kent’s police and crime commissioner (PCC) set out their wares on October 23rd. But the debate was animated. How would an elected PCC discover the public’s policing priorities? Was urban Medway to be stripped of coppers so that rural villages could feel safer? In declaring war on drugs, were candidates demonising the young people who take drugs rather than the adults who supply them?</p>

<p>Whoever wins the election in Kent on November 15th will take on a powerful job, with an annual salary of £85,000 ($136,000) and responsibility for an area that sends 17 MPs to Westminster. Single elected watchdogs are to replace appointed multi-member “authorities” overseeing each of the 41 police forces in England and Wales outside London. PCCs will set the agenda, control the budget, hire and fire the chief constable, and pull together bits of the criminal-justice system. In theory, the police should become far more accountable to the people they protect.</p>

<p>Awkwardly, the people don’t seem that keen on the change. Crime has been falling since the mid-1990s. Worry about the economy has overtaken fretting about law and order. A string of polls have shown little knowledge of PCCs and less enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Things look a little different this week. The full list of 192 candidates is now known. The Electoral Commission has popped a booklet through 21m front doors. Interest is picking up, says Sam Chapman, who runs TopOfTheCops, a lively website on the subject. A new poll for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) finds that 62% of people have at least heard about the elections, though only 15% say they are sure to vote.</p>

<p>For the most part, the candidates are white men of a certain age. Less predictably, independents are standing in all but seven areas, despite having to find upwards of £25,000 for the privilege. Around a third of people told the pollsters that they preferred an independent to a party candidate. (Though Conservatives usually have the edge on law and order, the next-biggest group was for Labour, thanks partly to the fact that the party selected candidates early and at least guaranteed their deposits.)</p>

<p>The dangers of politicising policing—at a time when trust in both police and politicians is at a low ebb—is one of two main issues to emerge in Kent’s race, in which most candidates are promising to provide visible policing, smite yobs and cherish victims. An independent with a real shot at winning is Ann Barnes, a successful former head of the Kent Police Authority. But opposing her is Craig Mackinlay, a Tory councillor with some ideas and the gift of the gab. Will party or dislike of politicians prove more potent?</p>

<p>The other broad debate is over how to squeeze police budgets further. Some forces have been outsourcing big tracts of business to private-sector firms such as G4S, of Olympics fame. Labour candidates want to halt “privatisation” in its tracks. Many Tories are prepared to try anything that works. Independents are split.</p>

<p>The government’s commitment to PCCs has seemed wavering recently, though two Tory heavies talked them up this week. Nick Herbert, the minister who steered the bill through Parliament, is on the backbenches since the cabinet reshuffle. Funds to help candidates make themselves known were refused. And the Home Office website to which voters are to refer goes live only on October 26th.</p>

<p>“It’s a classic case of a policy that worked as a headline but wasn’t thought through,” says Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary. Labour opposed the bill and expects to examine any reforms to it after a commission on policing reports in April. But by then PCCs will have their feet under the desk and the public may be getting used to them. They look here to stay.</p>
