<p>AMONG the Caribbean takeaways and money-transfer haunts on a Brixton high street stands Ms Cupcake, a brightly coloured shop selling “the naughtiest vegan cakes in town”. What began as a home experiment in 2010 is now a thriving business—a feat of entrepreneurship when money for fripperies is tight. “It’s an affordable treat,” explains Melissa Morgan, the real Ms Cupcake.</p>

<p>British high streets are depressed, particularly outside London. Vacancy rates, which stood at 3.1% in 2008, have stabilised at around 15%, with more empty shops in the North and Midlands. In the first half of this year an average of 20 chain stores a day closed in the biggest 500 town centres, according to the Local Data Company, a retail information source, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accountancy firm.</p>

<p>Cyclical decline in spending is only one reason: structural shifts to out-of-town shopping centres and the internet also figure. As jobs have migrated to enterprise zones and office parks outside city centres, fewer shoppers regularly visit the high street. Gone or dwindling are chain stores selling furniture, computer games, jewellery and toys. The collapse of JJB Sports, a sports retailer, in October is the latest in a string of failures that has claimed Clinton Cards, Game Group, a video-game retailer, and Peacocks, a bargain fashion chain. Large companies are concentrating on fewer shops in prime locations. Retailers doing well, such as Next, which sells fashion and homeware, and John Lewis, an upmarket department store, have embraced online shopping, with easy in-store returns. But not all stores are suffering equally. Independently owned ones, which account for two-thirds of Britain’s high streets, have fared better than chains, growing modestly in number in the past two years—though that rate is slowing. The number of independent bakeries on high streets rose by 17% from August 2011 to July 2012, according to Simply Business, an insurance provider.</p>

<p>Besides quirky independent outlets, the businesses faring best often provide a service—pawnbrokers and bookmakers in poor neighbourhoods, boutiques in wealthier places and beauty salons (reflecting a recent British fetish for nailcare) everywhere. They tend to have low start-up costs and complement the big chains rather than competing with them. “The places that provide an experience or are conveniently located will survive the rise of the internet,” says Alex Morton at Policy Exchange, a think-tank, which is researching a report on high streets.</p>

<p>The government has now pledged to make it easier to open pop-up shops and has committed over £80m ($130m) in loans for young entrepreneurs. Retailers say local authorities should also make it easier for different businesses to fill vacant units. But rents, parking and taxes remain hurdles. The British Retail Consortium complains that business rates, set according to September inflation figures, will result in a nationwide increase of £175m next year, on top of hikes over the last two years.</p>

<p>Against these odds, Mary Portas, a journalist and shopping guru, has proposed ideas to revive high streets, which include less onerous parking rules and more local investment. Two dozen towns—“Portas Pilots”—are receiving government funding and advice on how to revive flagging shopping centres. Other towns are meant to emulate them. But interest in sweeping schemes has waned. More prosaically, a new task force of landlords and bank officials is assessing what to do with indebted properties. Many high streets are unlikely to regain their former glory. Still, an eye for a gap in the market pays off. Where Ms Cupcake leads, others can follow.</p>
