<p>AS JOBS go, it is an oddly designed one: partly managing a sprawling, dysfunctional international conglomerate, partly giving intellectual leadership to an ancient religion struggling with modernity, and partly acting as a national cheerleader on state occasions. The incumbent Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has struggled with all these roles in his nine-year tenure. Will his successor, Justin Welby, the Bishop of Durham, do any better?</p>

<p>Chosen in secret, his appointment leaked this week before the formal announcement. That seemed to exemplify the church’s muddled ways. In Britain, it is losing members, short of cash (clergy are miserably paid) and divided on issues such as whether women can be bishops and whether homosexuality is sinful. Dozens of priests and hundreds of parishioners have left to join the Ordinariate, a body set up by the Roman Catholic church to woo disaffected Anglicans. Some believers feel beset by an intolerant secularism that punishes public signs of Christian belief. Many feel public apathy, not hostility, is the real problem.</p>

<p>Abroad, the Anglican Communion, which has 77m members, is still more bitterly divided. Conservatives (mostly in Africa but also in America) have set up their own structures in protest at what they see as the wishy-washy ways of the leadership. Anglicanism barely counts as a single church.</p>

<p>Archbishop Williams, an erudite polyglot whose private views are more liberal than much of the church’s, disappointed many with what seemed like waffle and indecision at home and abroad. Many felt he muffed big public occasions, such as last year’s royal wedding. His frank predecessor, Lord Carey, has often stolen the headlines.</p>

<p>Bishop Welby is a different character. Unusually for a prelate, he has a business background (he worked for an oil company before becoming ordained). Like both the prime minister and London’s mayor, he went to Eton, Britain’s best-known private school. He is an enthusiast for the “Alpha” course, a highly successful introduction to Christianity based at one of London’s most flourishing churches, Holy Trinity Brompton.</p>

<p>As a member of the House of Lords (which comes with the Durham job) he has taken a crisp stance on the financial crisis. Banking should be something that “helps people, rather than being there for people to help it”, he said.</p>

<p>Though nobody doubts his brains, many question his experience. He has held only one bishopric, Durham, and that for barely a year. That may be scant preparation for the manifold problems that await him.</p>
