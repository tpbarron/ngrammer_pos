<p>THERE is little that is typically Japanese about Softbank’s $20.1 billion takeover of Sprint Nextel, America’s third-largest mobile carrier. In fact, there is little that is typically Japanese about its architect, Softbank’s founder, Masayoshi Son, either. He is a billionaire entrepreneur, not a ladder-climbing company boss or salaryman. He is making corporate Japan’s largest-ever foreign acquisition, which he admits is a big gamble. He is financing it through Softbank’s own cash and debt, rather than hitting up shareholders. And he can explain his rationale for buying Sprint with few notes and with (albeit self-flattering) jokes.</p>

<p>But whereas the 55-year-old son of Korean-born parents remains an iconoclast in Japan, the pickle that he is in is familiar enough. Japan Inc has notched up a record amount (in dollar terms) of purchases abroad this year, partly because of a dawning realisation that population shrinkage may permanently reduce the size of its domestic market. When announcing the Sprint deal on October 15th, Mr Son pointed out that demographic factors alone might make not buying Sprint more risky than buying it.</p>

<p>Does that make it a good deal, though? It involves Softbank, Japan’s third-largest mobile carrier, taking 70% of Sprint for ¥957 billion ($12.1 billion), and injecting a further $8 billion of new capital to strengthen the company, which struggled for years after acquiring Nextel in 2005.</p>

<p>The main aim is to shore up Sprint’s balance-sheet so it can take part in the consolidation of the lower ranks of the American mobile-phone market, where the fourth and fifth carriers, T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS, are merging. Regulators would be happy to see stronger competitors to Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the dominant duo. Mr Son and Dan Hesse, Sprint’s chief executive, left little doubt they had unspecified acquisitions in mind.</p>

<p>Another aim is to strengthen Sprint’s hand in the race for spectrum, as America belatedly upgrades to superfast 4G networks. A big Softbank investment could enable Sprint to buy out Clearwire, of which it already owns 48%. That would give it greater access to a wireless technology known as TDD LTE, which Softbank also uses. Clearwire’s shares soared on reports that Sprint is in talks to take a bigger stake in it.</p>

<p>Mr Son is confident he has the money and the magic touch to help Sprint achieve those goals. His expertise, he says, came from buying the troubled Japanese mobile operations of Vodafone in 2006, which involved taking on a whopping $38 billion in debt when Softbank was a minnow. Since then its profits and profile have soared, and the debt was paid off seven years early. Sprint’s total debt, though more than $50 billion, is not as onerous given both companies’ prodigious cashflows. Mr Son also says Softbank can find synergies with Sprint by doing joint deals to knock down the price of smartphones.</p>

<p>The trouble is, other synergies are hard to find, and some think it was mainly ego that drove Mr Son to offer such a high price to enter a country in which he has no experience. (Endearingly, he doesn’t blanch at such fears, declaring: “I’m a man, and every man wants to be number one.”)</p>

<p>Stephen Givens, a Tokyo-based M&A consultant, says Mr Son is overpaying for a company with a weak position in a duopolistic market, mistakenly focusing on acquiring mobile networks whose value can quickly disappear. He believes Mr Son’s main success came from the “luck” of snaffling Apple’s iPhone ahead of Japan’s own former duopoly, NTT DoCoMo and KDDI. “This is a huge thing to bite off,” he says. Others note that, whereas six years ago foreign banks lent Softbank the money to buy out Vodafone in Japan, this time Japan’s deal-starved megabanks provided all the debt, possibly after undertaking too little analysis of the risks.</p>

<p>The access to cheap finance (and a strong yen) may be Mr Son’s secret weapons, however. His mobile business generates lots of cash. By buying Sprint as it is improving its performance, he is in effect doing a leveraged buy-out in an industry he knows well, with low borrowing rates. Whether or not he transforms the American mobile market, he may still be able to make money.</p>
