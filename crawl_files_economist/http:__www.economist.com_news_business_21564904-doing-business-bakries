<p>THE idea seemed perfect: by matching the financial skills of Nathaniel Rothschild, a member of a prominent banking dynasty (some of whose members are shareholders of The Economist), with the natural-resource wealth of the Bakrie family of Indonesia, foreign investors would be able to buy into the mining and palm-oil assets of one of the biggest emerging markets. But it has all gone horribly wrong.</p>

<p>On October 15th Mr Rothschild resigned in a huff from the board of Bumi PLC, the London-listed concern he set up with the Bakries. His resignation came less than a month after the board—apparently at his insistence—launched an investigation into alleged irregularities at Bumi PLC’s operations in Indonesia, and only a few days after the Bakrie family had attempted to buy him out. Indonesia’s market regulator is also looking into the affair.</p>

<p>For Mr Rothschild the debacle has been embarrassing, if lucrative. For outsiders, the main lesson is: know your partner.</p>

<p>The Bakries are one of Indonesia’s most powerful and controversial families, equally at home in business and politics. But they are facing serious financial problems in an empire that includes mining, palm oil, toll roads, telecommunications, and property. In August, company officials had to deny reports that Bumi Resources, Asia’s biggest coal exporter, was threatened with bankruptcy; it had reported a net loss of $322m for the first half of 2012. The company (of which Bumi PLC owns 29%) is now one of the operations under investigation. The family’s listed property developer, Bakrieland Development, is negotiating to sell Bakrie Toll Roads. Trading in shares of Bakrie Telecom was suspended in September amid debt concerns.</p>

<p>The Bakrie companies have grown fast through borrowing. They used company shares for collateral, and the share prices of both Bumi PLC and Bumi Resources have been in free fall lately. Local banks are reluctant to lend to the family, which—analysts say—is strapped for cash. That said, the Bakrie group remains Indonesia’s seventh-largest conglomerate, according to Globe Asia magazine’s annual Top 100 list, with $4.85 billion in revenue, thanks largely to its mining and palm-oil operations. Aburizal Bakrie himself (the family patriarch, pictured) was worth $890m in late 2011, according to Forbes magazine.</p>

<p>Mr Bakrie, who is 65, has (officially, at least) given up day-to-day management of the family empire to concentrate on politics. There are parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014—the latter is wide open—and Mr Bakrie wants to become president. He was a minister in President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s first cabinet from 2004 to 2009, and left that year to become chairman of the Golkar party, once the political vehicle of the late dictator Suharto. The party’s leaders have pledged to make him their presidential candidate, though some opinion polls show him lagging behind other hopefuls. Many Indonesians think Mr Bakrie is counting on the family fortune to bankroll his campaign. Party officials say they would back him whatever happens to that fortune. But it would hardly help his chances if the Bakrie empire crumbles, or even just stumbles.</p>

<p>Fairly or not, the family is widely perceived to have done well out of politics. It escaped criminal responsibility, for example, for an unstoppable flow of hot mud oozing out of the earth next to the mining site of a Bakrie-owned gas-exploration company in east Java in 2006.</p>

<p>With his square, protruding jaw, stocky frame and piercing eyes, Mr Bakrie looks like a former boxer and can be just as combative. Even if he were to run and lose in 2014, he could still exert political influence as chairman of Golkar. Indonesian governments are usually coalitions, and he could insert ministers into the next cabinet, retaining his political influence.</p>

<p>In short, Mr Bakrie is a formidable force in both business and politics. Small wonder Mr Rothschild’s fine idea proved so problematic in practice.</p>
