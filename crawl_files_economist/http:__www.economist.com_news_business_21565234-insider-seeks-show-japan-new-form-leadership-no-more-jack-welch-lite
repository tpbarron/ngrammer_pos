<p>IN 1999, Forbes, a business magazine, described an attempt to streamline Hitachi, a company which has long admired America’s General Electric, as “Jack Welch lite”. The effort failed. In the next decade Hitachi spent a fortune trying to restructure itself, but recorded Japan’s largest ever manufacturing loss in 2009. Today, it still has more than 1,000 subsidiaries or affiliates, and employs about 324,000 staff. However much it tries to simplify its businesses, which run from nuclear-power plants to data storage to washing machines, they still boggle the mind.</p>

<p>So Hiroaki Nakanishi (pictured), who took over as Hitachi’s boss in 2010, is trying a different approach: leadership. This is not as unusual as you might think in Japan. This month, Masayoshi Son led the firm he founded, SoftBank, in a $20 billion takeover of Sprint, its American mobile-phone counterpart. But it is not common in a boss who has risen up the ranks of a consensus-loving behemoth like Hitachi.</p>

<p>Instead of a top-down redesign, Mr Nakanishi, 66, has put the burden on his managers: they should benchmark Hitachi’s units against global firms, not Japanese ones, and their futures will be decided on that basis. In the past few years, Hitachi has recovered from crisis to overtake local rivals such as Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric, but taking a longer run of 25 years, its returns on equity have averaged a mere 1.8%, according to Macquarie, a bank. It trails similar-sized peers such as Siemens of Germany (see article). When Sir George Buckley, ex-boss of 3M, an American manufacturer, was asked what he could offer Hitachi as one of its first foreign board members, he replied: “3M’s profit margins are five times those of Hitachi. There are many lessons, I think.”</p>

<p>So Mr Nakanishi is promoting what he sees as another personal trait: boldness. He recounts that when he ran Hitachi’s hard-disk-drive unit, he persuaded his superiors to invest $800m in a business that was losing $400m a year. Normally, such a big bet would have been unheard of at Hitachi, but it worked. What is more, instead of keeping the business once it was profitable, this year he sold it to America’s Western Digital for $4.8 billion.</p>

<p>The impetus to think faster and more globally comes from the changing nature of Hitachi’s markets. In fiscal 2012, 43% of the company’s revenues came from overseas, up from around 30% a decade ago (though short of his 50% goal). This means the company’s mindset has to change, too. Emerging-market clients demand different goods and services. Emerging nations have highly competitive engineering firms. So there must be changes in hiring and talent management, he says. To recruit and nurture the best graduates, he has created a single Hitachi-wide employee pool, and the best can move around different units.</p>

<p>For the same reason, he is keen to promote foreigners, who he says have faced a “glass ceiling” at Hitachi. He notes that its biggest unit, Information and Telecommunications Systems, with 73,000 employees, has no foreigners in the top management team, though some of the American executives within it run $4 billion businesses.</p>

<p>Under its chairman Takashi Kawamura, Hitachi now has seven external board members, including three foreigners, on a 13-strong board. Mr Nakanishi laughs at the folly of having only “good guys” and “tomodachi” (friends) from Japan’s business lobby Keidanren on its board. Previously, he says, there was rarely serious talk about the future of the global economy. Now, Sir George and other non-execs have obliged Hitachi to discuss its future and that of its units in a more hard-nosed fashion.</p>

<p>Mr Nakanishi himself has taken responsibility for Hitachi’s main short-term priority: cost-cutting. He is attempting to iron out the myriad overlaps between its units in the back-office, in production costs, and in materials procurement. He still believes Hitachi can meet its goal of a 5.3% operating-profit margin this year.</p>

<p>But Hitachi continues to be buffeted by an economic slowdown in China, Japan’s island dispute with that country, and uncertainty about Japan’s nuclear-power business following the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Its businesses, even in Japan, face too much competition to be secure. Sir George borrows from a French writer, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, to describe what he sees as a big challenge. “Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add but when there is no longer anything to take away.” The quotation alone must be worth a seat on the board.</p>
