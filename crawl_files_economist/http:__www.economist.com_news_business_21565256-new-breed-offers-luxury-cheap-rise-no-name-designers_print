<p>TWO years ago Bill Small toiled at one of New Zealand’s largest wineries, “pushing numbers around spreadsheets” and dreaming of striking out on his own. Today he and his wife, Claudia, make six wines, including three sorts of Sauvignon Blanc, under their own label. They sell them through Naked Wines, a four-year-old company that claims to be Britain’s fastest-growing online wine seller. Most would-be winemakers must flatter distributors, schmooze potential investors and beg for social-media attention. “We don’t do that shoe leather,” says Mr Small.</p>

<p>Like any online vendor Naked Wines bypasses middlemen and shares the savings with customers. But this is trickier for wines than it is for books. How do you convince oenophiles that they are buying fine vintages for plonk prices? Especially when the same bottle is not for sale at the local off-licence? Naked Wines’ answer is to seek out gifted unknowns, provide a stage and draw an audience. The idea is to create cachet without the slog of building brands.</p>

<p>Naked Wines is not the only online company attempting this. New York’s Warby Parker claims to sell $600 spectacles for $95. San Francisco-based Everlane flogs smart clothes “with no crazy brand markups”. Ning Li, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, started Made.com after he realised that the £3,000 ($4, 800) name-brand sofa he coveted was made in his hometown, Foshan, for a tenth of the price. Made promises “beautiful designs without the high-street mark up”. Naked Wines is “a small part of something much bigger,” says its boss, Rowan Gormley: “the end of people paying to be sold to”.</p>

<p>That does not mean the end of salesmanship. To convince people to buy their stuff, the newcomers must pull off a difficult trick: exploit the upmarket street-cred that comes with a no-logo attitude while forging brand-like bonds with consumers. Naked Wines’ website tells stories to try to reassure and inspire customers (the recruitment of a famous label’s top winemaker; the wooing of the first black South African woman to qualify as a winemaker).</p>

<p>Buyers hype the wines via comments and ratings (“91% would buy again”). Made, which demands a bigger leap of faith (sofas cost up to £1,200), taps into the same sentiment by touting its designers and telling, in Mr Li’s words, “the story behind every product”.</p>

<p>The pitch is to rich-world consumers who are unnerved by recession but still want fancy goods. It takes different forms. Warby Parker (the name comes from two Jack Kerouac characters) gives to someone who needs them one pair of glasses for each one it sells. Naked has more than 100,000 “angels” who pay £20 a month each in exchange for discounts. This provides the flow of cash needed to back Naked’s up-front purchases. The firm usually pays for the grapes, bottles, corks and shipping, rents winery space and even helps design the labels. The winemakers take little risk. They supply only their skills, and are paid royalties.</p>

<p>While scorning the hoopla of traditional brands, the upstarts are racing to build brands of their own. Everlane, which is barely a year old, has signed up 350,000 “members”. After 2½ years of trading Made has 80 employees and is breaking even. Mr Li is plotting a push into Europe. Sales of Naked wines will jump 55% this year to £60m and the company will turn its first operating profit, a year ahead of schedule, says Mr Gormley. It, too, is expanding into America and Australia. Not all its customers are delighted. Some find the marketing intrusive. One critic sniffed that she could only find one Naked wine worth buying. Others, though, seem happy to turn convention on its head—and get Naked before they get drunk.</p>
