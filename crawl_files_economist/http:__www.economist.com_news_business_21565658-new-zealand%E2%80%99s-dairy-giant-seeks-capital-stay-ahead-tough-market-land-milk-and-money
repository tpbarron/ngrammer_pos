<p>ALTHOUGH New Zealand still has seven times as many sheep as people, cows drive its economy these days. Dairy products are a quarter of the country’s exports, giving it a third of the world’s dairy trade. Large tracts of sheep pasture and forest are being converted to churn out more milk, or “white gold”.</p>

<p>Bestriding the local market with a share of over 90% is Fonterra, a co-operative formed in 2001 as a national champion, from two smaller entities and the former New Zealand Dairy Board. The only truly global Kiwi company, with annual revenue of almost NZ$20 billion ($16.4 billion), Fonterra operates in 100 countries and has 10,500 farmer-owners. Rabobank of the Netherlands ranks it the world’s fourth-largest dairy company.</p>

<p>So the company’s announcement last month that it would let non-farmer investors buy in for the first time has stirred great interest, among both investors on the country’s modest stockmarket and foreign fund managers. Fonterra intends to raise at least NZ$500m with the issue, whose price will be announced on November 27th. It is not selling shares with voting rights. Outside investors will be offered units in the Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund, legally separate from the company but with dividends paid out of its profits. Depending on the price of these units, the company predicts they will yield up to 7% in 2013.</p>

<p>Fonterra will also start letting its farmer-owners trade their shares among themselves. At the moment they can only sell them back to Fonterra (at times when production is weak). Of course, when they do, it eats up the firm’s capital, just when it may be most needed. The hope is that by letting farmers sell to other farmers, this risk will be reduced.</p>

<p>Fonterra’s net profit of NZ$624m in the year to July was down 19% on the previous year, mainly because a tax credit from the previous year was not repeated. Dairy prices fell in 2011 but have recovered lately, as production cuts in other countries have boosted their demand for milk imports. Fonterra has made some smart investments in Asia and Latin America, where demand for dairy products is growing. But in mature markets, health worries and higher prices have cut demand.</p>

<p>As in so many other businesses, Chinese competitors are a growing threat. Rabobank’s ranking still has rich-country firms, led by Switzerland’s Nestlé, at the top, but Chinese ones such as Yili and Mengniu are moving up. About a fifth of New Zealand’s dairy exports go to China, and Fonterra makes dairy products there under local brands. But the Kiwi dollar’s strength is making it easier for Chinese rivals to win market share.</p>

<p>Fonterra’s farmers are already angry that the price it pays them for their milk fell by a fifth last year. Some now worry that the sale of stakes to outside investors will cut their earnings further, and will be the first step in a gradual move away from farmer ownership of the co-operative. Many New Zealand farms are still fairly small and family-run. By clubbing together to form a near-monopoly of local supply, they have so far been able to avoid the fate of Britain’s dairy farmers, who have been squeezed like udders by wholesalers and supermarket chains.</p>
