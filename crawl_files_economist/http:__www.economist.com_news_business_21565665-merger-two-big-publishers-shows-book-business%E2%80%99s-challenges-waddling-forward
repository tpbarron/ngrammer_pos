<p>AS MANY pundits have observed, bondage is fashionable in publishing circles. So it was no surprise when, on October 29th, Random House and Penguin, two big publishers, announced that they would handcuff themselves to each other.</p>

<p>The book industry has felt more pain than pleasure in the past few years, largely thanks to technology. Many physical retailers, such as Borders, have shut down after losing out to cheap online sellers, particularly Amazon.</p>

<p>In only three years the page has turned for electronic books; American publishers generated $2.1 billion in revenues from them last year, up by more than 3,200% from 2008, according to BookStats, which tracks the industry. In theory e-books offer better margins, because they are cheaper to produce. But publishers fret that customers will soon expect to pay less for all books. That won’t be so good for profits.</p>

<p>Bertelsmann, the German company that owns Random House, and Pearson, Penguin’s parent (and a part-owner of The Economist), hope a tie-up will give them more clout. Combined, they will account for around a quarter of English-language book sales. That could help them negotiate better deals with the likes of Amazon, which sells around 65% of American e-books, according to Barclays Capital.</p>

<p>But the main benefit of the merger will come from savings on printing, warehouses and distribution, which could amount to £100m ($161m), analysts say. If such savings materialise (and they often don’t, see article), that would free up cash to invest in going digital and experimenting more with self-publishing platforms, a burgeoning business that turns other people’s vanity into cash. They could also save money by squeezing authors. Mark Oliver of Oliver & Ohlbaum, a consultancy, expects Penguin Random House to cut the number of midlist authors, just as music labels once cut mediocre crooners.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the deal Pearson must stick around for at least three years, but can sell its stake after that to focus on its education business. Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns the book publisher Harper Collins, was interested in buying Penguin, but he was too late. Analysts have long predicted consolidation among the six big book publishers (including Hachette, Macmillan and Simon & Schuster); this merger may not be the last.</p>

<p>The deal should be concluded next year. However, there could be twists in the plot. Penguin Random House needs regulatory approval. But earlier this year America’s Department of Justice sued Apple and five publishers, including Penguin, alleging that they conspired to raise the price of e-books above what Amazon charged. Three settled, but Apple, Penguin and Macmillan are fighting on. A legal battle could complicate antitrust approval.</p>

<p>And an even greater threat than Amazon looms. According to Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, a bank, the march of Penguin and others into digital formats could make them more vulnerable to piracy. E-books are easy to share by e-mail and speedy to steal: it can take around four seconds to download a pirated version of “The Help”, a novel about servants, but over three hours to download the film. If piracy hits publishing like it hit music, profits could evaporate, he says. Here’s hoping for a happier ending.</p>
