<p>FEW 650-room hotels charge a minimum of $350 a night but don’t offer Wi-Fi in the rooms. The Hilton in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, can charge such hefty rates because it offers a more old-fashioned kind of connection. It is the place where Nigerian Big Men schmooze, and where supplicants come to beg favours from the oil-rich federal government. Until recently, getting a bed there was often difficult at any price.</p>

<p>Businessmen of all stripes mingle by the pool before seeking out one of many nooks and crannies for confidential chats. Tony Blair recently had fruit juice on the terrace with local religious leaders and the central-bank governor. One of the Nigerian president’s closest advisers, Oronto Douglas, has kept a room at the Hilton for years. His sidekick, Ken Saro-Wiwa, son of a tribal leader executed by a past military regime, paces the lobby, trying to avoid a flock of job-seekers.</p>

<p>The owners have done very nicely. But competition is stirring. New hotels are under construction in Abuja, and across Africa. Marriott will have 50 hotels in Africa by 2020, a six-fold increase. Accor, a French hotel group, will add nearly 5,000 rooms in 30 hotels by 2016. Most international hotel brands are scouting African capitals.</p>

<p>They are busy because Africa is growing fast and does not yet have nearly enough hotels. Occupancy rates are sky-high, and so are margins. Yet risks abound. A year ago, Boko Haram, a Nigerian terror group, blew up, in quick succession, the national police command in Abuja and the UN head office. Since then the group has expanded its attacks. The American government has issued travel warnings and cited specific threats against the Hilton. A sense of siege has taken hold in the capital. Checkpoints and security barriers are everywhere.</p>

<p>The effect on the hotel has been dramatic. Once perpetually full, its conference facilities have emptied out. Foreign companies have taken their business to Lagos, the commercial capital. International airlines no longer dare to keep crews in Abuja. The hotel won’t say how far its occupancy rate has dropped. But taxi drivers at the front gate guess it is down by 60%. On the upside, Wi-Fi internet access will it seems be installed in all rooms before the end of the year.</p>
