<p>No balls: “During the 18th Party Congress period, taxi drivers are to be on guard for passengers carrying any type of ball. Look for passengers who intend to spread messages by carrying balloons that bear slogans or ping-pong balls bearing reactionary messages.” A notice issued to Beijing taxi drivers and posted on Sina Weibo, a microblog, October 31st</p>
