<p>The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) revised down its 2012 forecast for global inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to less than $1.6 trillion. Inflows in the first half of 2012 fell by 8% on a year earlier, to $668 billion. Despite its inflows falling, China became the worldâ€™s largest recipient of FDI in the first half of 2012, largely because FDI to America flopped. But inflows to America may perk up: SoftBank, a Japanese telecoms firm, recently bought a $20 billion stake in Sprint Nextel. As investment into rich countries has fallen (by 9.5% in the first half of 2012, compared with the same period in 2011), developing countries now receive over half of global FDI inflows.</p>
