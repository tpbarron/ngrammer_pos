<p>THE day after Montenegro’s election on October 14th newspapers ran pictures of politicians with champagne. Milo Djukanovic, who has dominated politics for two decades, glugged from a huge bottle. But opposition leaders were content with their normal ones. That sums up the result: all were happy.</p>

<p>No government has ever changed hands via the ballot box in Montenegro. Yet this election has changed the landscape. Mr Djukanovic’s Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) is the single biggest party and will lead the next government. But two new political forces have entered parliament, as the second- and fourth-biggest groups.</p>

<p>Now a power struggle will begin. Mr Djukanovic, who remains party leader but gave up the job of prime minister to Igor Luksic in 2010, hinted in the campaign that he might return. He may have wanted to reassure wavering DPS voters, for whom he is the father of the nation who guided the country through the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the union with Serbia towards full independence. Some suggest that Mr Djukanovic may indeed return to “clean up the kindergarten”, but others are less sure. Miodrag Lekic, the leader of the new Democratic Front coalition and a former foreign minister who fell out with Mr Djukanovic, is a serious opposition contender for president. Many believe only Mr Djukanovic can beat him in the presidential election next spring.</p>

<p>Most Montenegrins believe that, whoever is prime minister, Mr Djukanovic remains in charge. Mr Luksic says he does not mind this perception—but that “it is wrong”. His government, he emphasises, has led the country through the economic crisis and been re-elected. It opened European Union accession negotiations in June and has laid the groundwork for joining NATO. And last year it oversaw GDP growth of 3.2%.</p>

<p>Mitja Drobnic, head of the EU’s office in Montenegro, says starting EU membership talks speaks for itself. But he adds that the fight against organised crime and corruption “needs to go as high as possible into the political and economic elite.” Stevo Muk, a political analyst, says Montenegro has been good at adopting EU-compliant laws but implementation is “very poor”. When it comes to fighting corruption, he notes, Montenegro lacks a key prerequisite: regular changes of government at elections.</p>
