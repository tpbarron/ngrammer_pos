<p>SPAIN’S prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is a man with many problems. Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants European funds intended to rescue Spain’s banks to be funnelled through government accounts, meaning that they will increase the country’s already mushrooming national debt still more. Next month he will face both a general strike and elections in Catalonia, where separatism is on the rise. And he must soon decide if Spain needs a politically damaging bail-out.</p>

<p>Mr Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP) won regional elections in Galicia (see map) on October 21st, but a poll in the Basque country on the same day added another headache to his list: the socialist-led government was ejected and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) came top, winning a third of votes. Worse, “constitutionalist” parties, meaning those happy with the Basque country’s status as part of Spain, won just a third of the seats in the regional parliament. Euskal Herria Bildu, a coalition of separatist groups, including the former political wing of ETA, a terrorist group which downed arms a year ago, apparently for good, took a quarter of the vote.</p>

<p>The wave of support for EH Bildu is proof of how much ETA’s bloodshed had damaged the cause of independence. When ETA was still active, Basque voters never backed a single separatist group in such numbers. EH Bildu is now the region’s second political force and a serious rival to the PNV, whose position on independence is ambiguous. Iñigo Urkullu, the party’s leader and the region’s future president, must now take a stand.</p>

<p>Will he follow Artur Mas, Catalonia’s president, and call a referendum? Not immediately. On local television, speaking in the Basque language, he backed the mushy concept of an independence “of the 21st-century kind”. Elsewhere he has argued for a new bilateral relationship with Spain, implying that a revised autonomy statute would do. His manifesto talked of “becoming less dependent every day until we achieve independence.” Wherever he comes down, both the PNV and EH Bildu demand an explicit right to self-determination that Spain’s constitution does not permit. If they do not get their way, tension will increase, warns Kepa Aulestia, a Basque commentator.</p>

<p>Mr Urkullu’s ambiguity contrasts with Mr Mas’s growing stridence. But opinion polls show Basques are less keen on independence. While 51% of Catalans would vote in favour, a majority of Basques show “little or no” interest in it. Mr Urkullu wants to leave the issue until 2015, which would let him see what happens in both Catalonia and Scotland, where a referendum on independence is due in 2014. EH Bildu will try to hurry him up. Much depends on where he turns for parliamentary support.</p>

<p>With luck, Mr Rajoy’s Basque problem may go away, but bad news elsewhere is piling up. The economy has shrunk for five quarters in a row. A deepening social-security hole will add 1% of GDP to this year’s budget deficit, so it may exceed the target of 6.3% set by the European Commission. Moreover, two painful decisions await. Next month Mr Rajoy may announce that Spain cannot afford to peg pensions to inflation. And then there is the bail-out. “When I make the decision,” Mr Rajoy said on October 19th, “I will say so.”</p>
