<p>THE anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian uprising against the Soviet Union on October 23rd should have been a day of national unity. But the tens of thousands of demonstrators in two competing protests that day in Budapest, the country’s capital, showed how polarised Hungarian society has become under the rule of the pugnacious prime minister Viktor Orban and his populist Fidesz party.</p>

<p>His supporters gathered in front of the parliament—more than 400,000 of them, according to the government (though MTI, the state news agency, reported only 150,000). To rousing cheers Mr Orban thundered against “bank capitalism” and those in Brussels who wanted the Hungarian people to bear the cost of the recession and a weakened economy.</p>

<p>The main opposition met downtown in somewhat smaller numbers (pictured). The star attraction was Gordon Bajnai, who heralded his return to national politics. A well-regarded technocrat, he served as Hungary’s caretaker prime minister from 2009 to 2010. He accused the government of systematically breaking the backbone of Hungarian democracy, “vertebra by vertebra”. The government, he said, is carving up the country among its clients.</p>

<p>Mr Orban’s fiery language against Brussels and international finance can still rally the faithful. It also saps support from the radical nationalist Jobbik party, which has signally failed to reap benefits from Hungary’s economic crisis. But the next election, scheduled for the spring of 2014, will be decided on the centre ground. Fidesz retains a lead in the polls, but its support has drained away since its landslide in 2010. Politics.hu, a poll tracker, shows Fidesz at 31% on average, the Socialists at 20%, while Jobbik is steady at 13%.</p>

<p>Fidesz came to power promising to support the beleaguered middle class. Tax cuts for families with several children have helped it, but many others are still in pain. Professionals such as doctors and teachers earn a fraction of what they would get in the West, yet food and utility bills are now barely cheaper.</p>

<p>Mr Orban recently claimed that he governed “ten million freedom fighters”. The reality is more mundane. Many Hungarians remember how they voted overwhelmingly to join the European Union. They want Budapest to stand up for their country’s interests but in a reasonable manner. They are growing tired of Mr Orban’s belligerent rhetoric, especially while the government is still seeking a deal with the EU and the International Monetary Fund for a loan of €15 billion ($19.5 billion).</p>

<p>The biggest party is that of the undecided. Half of voters say they do not support any party. So the race remains wide open. Mr Orban’s nightmare is that the relaunched Mr Bajnai will unite the fractious opposition, reassure business people and the middle class, and thus bring the legions of undecided to the polling booths. The prime minister is right to be worried.</p>
