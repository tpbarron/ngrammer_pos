<p>IN RECENT years Asia’s insurance markets have changed from irrelevant to irresistible. They fared better than Western markets during the financial crisis. The region is now expected to contribute more than half of global premium growth over the next ten years. A scramble is on for the best assets, with over $100 billion in acquisitions seen in Asia since 2009.</p>

<p>Western insurers, such as Canada’s Manulife and Britain’s Prudential, have been busily knitting together regional operations to take advantage. AIA, a regional insurer that was formerly part of AIG, agreed a $1.8 billion deal in early October to buy the Malaysian life-insurance assets of ING, a Dutch firm. Kevin Strain, head of Asia for Sun Life, a Canadian insurer with operations across the region, thinks his firm can double last year’s local earnings by 2015. Such aspirations are understandable: Asia’s ageing populations and growing middle classes mean that the market will continue to grow. But foreign firms will find the road ahead rougher, argues a new book* by two McKinsey consultants.</p>

<p>Regulatory snags and distribution headaches are two obvious obstacles, but the biggest threat comes from the rise of potent local rivals. In some countries, notably China, domestic insurers dominate simply because the playing field is heavily tilted. Other bits of the region, such as South-East Asia, are open to foreign entrants. Not every such newcomer is Western, however. A number of Asian buyers are also on the march.</p>

<p>Japan’s Dai-ichi Life already has investments in Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and India. Nippon Life, another Japanese insurer, recently gobbled up a 26% stake in India’s Reliance Life for $680m. On October 19th Richard Li, the younger son of Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong property tycoon who is Asia’s richest man, joined battle. Pacific Century Group, his firm, agreed to pay $2.1 billion in cash to ING to acquire its insurance businesses in Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand. The younger Mr Li, who also runs PCCW, Hong Kong’s biggest telecoms company, plans to use his new insurance-distribution network to sell products devised by PineBridge Investments, an American firm with $68 billion in assets that he acquired from AIG in 2010.</p>

<p>Asian insurers may be gaining momentum but that does not mean life will be easy for them, either. Many are now publicly listed, which brings unfamiliar pressure from shareholders: investors get tired of endless capital calls from growth-obsessed managers. Regulators are also increasingly pushing insurers to shift from relentless growth to sustainable profitability.</p>

<p>For their part, Western firms are still a force but they must work harder than they did in the past. Some are finding particular niches, such as wealth-management products. America’s CIGNA has discovered a profitable way to use telemarketing in China; Nextia, a subsidiary of AXA Japan, has developed an online insurance business. As Joe Ngai, one of the authors of the new book, puts it: “there is no low-hanging fruit left in Asia.”</p>
