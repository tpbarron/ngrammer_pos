<p>GREG SMITH is one of life’s smaller big winners. His ticket out of Johannesburg came from winning a scholarship to Stanford University; insight into a computerised application system opened the way to an internship at Goldman Sachs; and an understanding of its Darwinian hiring system led to a job, luxurious perks, and high pay. His 12-year career ended with a scathing denunciation of the bank on the editorial page of the New York Times and the publication this week of a book whose title, “Why I left Goldman Sachs”, could spark an entire genre by disaffected drones in successful organisations.</p>

<p>A whispering campaign of sorts has undermined Mr Smith, suggesting he never really was up to Goldman’s standards. This is probably true, although a similar criticism could be made of everyone who ever worked there. And to Mr Smith’s credit, he left on his own terms, no small feat. Of the 75 college graduates recruited from his year, only 7 were still at the firm when he departed for the last time. No doubt others left voluntarily, but one theme that keeps popping up is that Goldman is a difficult place to join, and a difficult place to stay. Critics have panned the book for being short on killer details, but it provides a rare inside look into a career path to which many aspire: from nothing to Wall Street affluence.</p>

<p>It will also be read because of its characterisation of Goldman’s integrity. Where once it profited from helping clients prosper, the bank shifted, Mr Smith contends, into an entity that profited from clients. This sentiment was particularly evident, Mr Smith says, in the firm’s London office, where greed and self-interest ran riot and clients were derisively referred to as “muppets”, suggesting a childlike naivety that could be exploited. Mr Smith is stunned by a colleague who says it is easier to recover a lost reputation than lost principal.</p>

<p>Goldman denies this portrait. It reportedly scanned internal e-mails to see how often muppets were mentioned. Nearly all referred to last year’s film about Kermit and Miss Piggy. But the old business model of merely being an intermediary acting on behalf of clients does seem to have run its course. For Mr Smith, that is to Goldman’s discredit. But his book implicitly raises another question: why clients don’t wise up.</p>
