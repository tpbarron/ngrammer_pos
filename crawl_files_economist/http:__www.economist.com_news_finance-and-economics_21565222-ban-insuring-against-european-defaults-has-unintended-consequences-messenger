<p>EUROPEAN policymakers fret about the value of euro-zone sovereign bonds in the manner of a parent worried by a sick child’s temperature. One way of reading the thermometer is to look at the price of sovereign credit-default swaps (CDSs), an insurance policy which pays out if a national government defaults. At the height of the debt crisis, anxious investors pushed the value of these instruments sky-high. Now the region’s benchmark CDS index, known as the iTraxx SovX Western Europe, has plunged to its lowest level in over two years (see chart).</p>

<p>The SovX was once seen as a bellwether of the eurozone’s troubles, so its decline should be a cause for celebration. Not quite. Although the situation in the euro zone has eased in recent weeks, the sharp movements in the SovX are widely attributed to new European Union rules on CDSs which come into force on November 1st. The rules will, in effect, ban you from betting that an EU country will hit the buffers unless you can prove you have good reason for doing so. The aim is to thwart speculators who buy the insurance without actually owning the product to be insured. Only investors holding a country’s bonds or similar assets (such as shares in a business whose fate is closely tied to the government’s) will be allowed to protect themselves against default.</p>

<p>The rules are part of a broader package of EU measures designed to rein in short-selling, whereby investors gain if shares or bonds decline. Politicians have blamed short-sellers for hobbling both European banks and governments, with little evidence to back that up. The problem is that by banning speculators, they may jeopardise the rest of the sovereign CDS market.</p>

<p>Volumes for individual countries such as Portugal and Belgium have thinned dramatically, says Michael Hampden-Turner, a strategist at Citigroup, making them potentially untradeable. That may partly reflect market jitters ahead of the new rules coming in. But few investors will be able to prove they need credit-default insurance against all the 15 countries included in the Western Europe SovX, meaning the index itself is probably doomed. Investors also doubt whether credit-default swaps really work when it comes to enforcing claims on governments: when Greece restructured its debts in March, for instance, many months of back-room haggling ensued before the CDSs finally paid out. (Greece argued it was not defaulting, as its debts were “voluntarily” restructured. Good luck trying this with your mortgage.)</p>

<p>Investors are already looking at new ways to place bearish bets on euro-zone countries. One way is to short government bonds themselves, though in practice this is fiddly. Some fret about the effect of “proxy hedging”: if an investor can’t buy a CDS on Italy itself, a swap on a large Italian bank, which would almost inevitably fall over in the case of a sovereign default, is a suitable substitute. J.P.Morgan pitched this idea to its clients earlier this month. The effect will be to push up CDS spreads for large firms, raising their cost of borrowing.</p>

<p>Critics say the restrictions on credit-default swaps amount to an attempt to rig the market: only those with a rosy enough view of the euro zone to have bought underlying bonds can trade. If so, it won’t work. The lower CDS levels seen today would in the past have translated into lower borrowing costs for governments. That link is weakening. Politicians may shoot one messenger, but markets continue to send the same signals.</p>
