<p>HONG KONG’S newish chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, came into power making several bold promises. He vowed to take on oligopolistic land tycoons, stem the tide of mainland money distorting local markets, and implement bold policies that would make homes in the territory more affordable.</p>

<p>Mr Leung last month announced property-transaction taxes on non-residents and speculators designed to do all three things at once. On October 26th Hong Kong imposed a buyers’ stamp duty of 15% on non-locals (read: mainland Chinese). An existing tax designed to curb speculation was also stiffened.</p>

<p>Something needed to be done. Residential-property prices, already among the world’s highest, are still soaring (see chart). First-time buyers are hardest hit. Just coming up with the 30% deposit required for a mortgage on a starter flat now costs 3.3 times gross median household income. The new measures may help a bit. Andrew Lawrence of Barclays argues that they will dampen enthusiasm for high-end homes among mainlanders (who rarely buy starter flats). A cooling in prices at this end of the market will allow more locals to upgrade to fancy or new flats, he thinks, thereby releasing small flats for first-time buyers.</p>

<p>That is not the same as pricking a bubble. Developers may well be stuck with slower volumes and lower profits, but the impact on prices will be muted because they are likely to withdraw some properties from the market, hoarding floorspace rather than cutting its price. CLSA, a broker, predicts that demand will drop by 20%, but prices will soften by a mere 1-2% in the fourth quarter. It also worries that the curbs on speculative money in residential property will redirect the flows into the market for commercial and industrial property.</p>

<p>Similar anti-foreigner taxes introduced in Singapore have failed to cool its market. Hong Kong’s position is worse since, unlike Singapore, its currency is pegged to the American dollar—so it is stuck with America’s cheap-money policies. The new taxes will not stop local money fleeing negative real interest rates into property, bubble be damned.</p>
