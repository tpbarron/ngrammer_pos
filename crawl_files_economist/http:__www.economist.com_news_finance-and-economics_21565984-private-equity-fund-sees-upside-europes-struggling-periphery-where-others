<p>PERHAPS the only thing more spine-tingling than riding a roller-coaster is to buy one, particularly if it sits in a theme park in Spain. A stream of headlines about bail-outs, teetering banks and high unemployment has repelled investors from Europe’s struggling periphery. That did not stop Investindustrial, a private-equity group with a focus on Spain and Italy, from this week buying the 50% stake it did not already own in PortAventura, an amusement park near Barcelona. It is now looking for other investments there.</p>

<p>Andrea Bonomi, Investindustrial’s founder, says profit can be made where others fear to tread. Many buy-out groups are shunning Europe entirely or ploughing money into relatively healthy regions like Scandinavia, pushing prices of target companies there to pre-crisis levels. In Spain state-backed banks and other government bodies are shedding corporate assets faster than private-equity firms can buy them, leading to far lower valuations.</p>

<p>Mr Bonomi says this will help his current crop of Mediterranean investments easily outperform their northern counterparts. The €120m ($153m) PortAventura deal follows a joint bid last month for nearly half of Euskaltel, a Basque telecoms operator. In both cases Investindustrial paid a fraction of what it cost to build the asset in the first place. Local buy-out groups that once might have pushed up prices have all but disappeared as their own (often foreign) backers have exited.</p>

<p>Investindustrial’s approach is not to tar the whole of southern Europe with the same brush. Its two recent investments in Spain are in wealthy, “quasi-German” regions, as Mr Bonomi puts it. Nearly 40% of the visitors to PortAventura are foreign tourists who care more about steady sunshine and good airport links than about local employment prospects.</p>

<p>The fund’s other big market is Italy, from where its original family investors—Mr Bonomi’s and the Benettons, a clothing dynasty—hail. Investindustrial has managed to thrive there despite average annual economic growth of just 1% since 1990, when it was founded. This is because the companies it backs grow by expanding abroad, often trading on Italy’s glamorous image.</p>

<p>Ducati, a motorcycle-maker which the firm bought in 2006, opened a plant in Thailand and over the past five years more than tripled its profits. Audi recently paid €860m for the marque. Permasteelisa, which specialises in glass façades for skyscrapers, was bought by a Japanese rival last year after rapid expansion in Asia and the Middle East. Teams in Shanghai and New York help firms in the portfolio make the transition from local to global markets. Such foreign sales provide a natural hedge against euro-zone woes.</p>

<p>Investindustrial has invested €2 billion since its inception and claims returns on realised deals of around 30%. It is among the few European private-equity firms to have raised a bigger fund since the downturn. It is in the final stages of assembling €1.25 billion to invest in the next five years, up on its previous €1 billion fund. Most other funds have had to settle for smaller war chests; some have failed to raise money altogether. That success comes despite eschewing any Italian investors “in order to keep our outsider’s perspective” when analysing buy-out opportunities, says Mr Bonomi.</p>

<p>There are signs that competitors may be returning to Mediterranean shores. Henry Kravis of KKR, a large American firm, said last month that he saw a “real opportunity” in Spain. Bain Capital, another titan, recently paid €1 billion for Telefónica’s call-centre business. A private-equity firm is among those looking to buy Telecom Italia’s media business. Queues to have the nerves jangled will get longer.</p>
