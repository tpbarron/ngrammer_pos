<p>WINNING an election tries a candidate’s mettle. But winning a place on the ballot paper is another kind of test. Arcane and dubious eligibility criteria feature in many countries’ constitutions and electoral rules. The newly pluralist countries of north Africa, for example, display what many might find a xenophobic streak. Draft constitutions in Egypt and Libya require presidential candidates to ditch not only any foreign passports but also foreign spouses. Tunisia is even harsher: it disqualifies anyone with a foreign parent. Even the keenest candidate can do little to shed that taint. A draft in Egypt had a similar rule. But when it turned out that a leading Salafist’s late mother had once held an American passport, the wording changed.</p>

<p>Countries that have shed communist dictatorship are more liberal. Estonia’s president, Toomas Hendrick Ilves, was born in Sweden of émigré parents. For unelected heads of state, the regime is positively anarchic. Most European monarchs have foreign forebears (British aristocrats, some claiming Norman ancestry, disparage the royal family’s German roots).</p>

<p>The young and ambitious may face a wait. Most countries (including the United States) set a minimum age for the head of state at 35. France, though, dropped its threshold from 23 to 18 in 2011, whereas Italy excludes the under-50s. Tajikistan is a rare example of an upper age limit: you cannot be over 65.</p>

<p>Another hurdle is money. Somalia’s new constitution, published last month, requires applicants to pay $10,000 to register their candidacy. In Liberia they must own property worth at least $25,000. Argentinian presidential candidates need a minimum annual income of 2,000 pesos (about $420).</p>

<p>Education levels matter too. Turkey insists its president hold a university degree, whereas the Philippines’ constitution only stipulates the ability “to read and write”. Kyrgyz, Ukrainian, or Uzbek hopefuls must speak the state language fluently. Sierra Leone requires English.</p>

<p>The trickiest requirements are the fuzziest ones. Iran requires “trustworthiness and piety”; Iraq stipulates “a good reputation”. In the contest to elect Singapore’s head of state in 1999 and 2005 the Presidential Elections Committee deemed only one candidate, S.R. Nathan, to be a “person of integrity” (among other stringent criteria), and hence fit to run.</p>
