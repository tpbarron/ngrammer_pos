<p>Choose life</p>

<p>SIR – Regarding your support for the right of assisted suicide for the terminally ill (“Easing death”, October 20th), no one can really tell how long a person has to live. With compassion and treatment this period can be lengthened, sometimes indefinitely. In any case, as Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the hospice movement, used to say, last days are not lost days. They can be used to give time to loved ones, to put things right where they need to be, and to prepare for a good death.</p>

<p>As for the “religious” reasons you alluded to for opposing assisted suicide, these are based on intrinsic human dignity and are important not just for “religious” people but for the wider good. Against this, the secular dogma of radical autonomy continues to see people as individual units rather than as relational beings whose living and dying affects others, not least those nearest and dearest to them.</p>

<p>You yourself mentioned a “slippery slope” of extending assisted suicide from the terminally ill to the seriously ill. If autonomy is what it’s all about, then why not permit those who are depressed, the disabled and the disappointed to end their lives? It is perfectly understandable that doctors’ organisations are wary of any suggestion that they should participate in the killing of patients.</p>

<p>SIR – Another argument against assisted suicide is that there are times when giving someone a choice actually harms them. This happens in a case where an unchosen default is preferable to having a choice. Some ethicists, such as David Velleman at New York University, argue that giving the very ill the choice to commit suicide easily and legally harms all ill people by taking from them the option of continuing to live by default.</p>

<p>We expect human beings to provide reasons for their choices. So by requiring ill people to choose to live rather than just living by default such policies require them to justify their continued existence in a way that healthy people are not required to do.</p>

<p>Theological debate</p>

<p>SIR – “Theological” does not mean irrational or fanatical (“A deficit of common sense”, October 27th). Theologians are committed in principle to applying reason to subjects of central human importance, in the same way that climate-change scientists, politicians and economists should be.</p>

<p>A sad decline in South Africa</p>

<p>* SIR – I am sure I was not the only South African who cringed while reading your sober analysis of South Africa’s woes (“Over the rainbow”, October 20th). Sadly, South Africa has over-promised and under-delivered since 1994. Things have not got better for the vast majority of my countrymen. Although more people may now have brick-and-mortar homes, electricity and running water, the holy grail of opportunity is proving even more elusive than under Apartheid. It is all good and well to receive government largesse, but dividing wealth is no substitute for multiplying it. Unless the economy grows faster than the population and exceeds inflation, poverty and unemployment will loom ever larger.</p>

<p>There are essentially three reasons why the economy is underperforming: poor education, an unfair legislative framework and an incompetent public sector. The root cause of all three failures is the African National Congress’s “cadre deployment” strategy. In its heart of hearts, the ANC remains a revolutionary movement with a strong Stalinist tradition, hence its continual references to a “national democratic revolution” and talk of a “second transition”. By placing loyalists in positions of power the ruling party not only achieves hegemony, but, equally importantly, becomes the dispenser of patronage.</p>

<p>Technically demanding positions are filled by people without the requisite skills or experience who happen to be politically connected. Adding insult to injury is the fact that, in a country with 25% unemployment, thousands of well-paid jobs are vacant because there are no suitably qualified non-white candidates, and white job-seekers are precluded from consideration because of affirmative action requirements. The public sector has become a source of well-paid sheltered employment for supporters of the governing party.</p>

<p>This has turned the bureaucracy into an ineptocracy.</p>

<p>Louis Rossouw Faerie Glen, South Africa</p>

<p>* SIR – Your report on the state of South Africa was distressingly accurate. However, you fell into the trap of the ultimate cliché by quoting “the Cape Town student”, as saying that she would never vote for the opposition Democratic Alliance “as she still believes the party’s policies discriminate against black and coloured (mixed-race) people.” From many years of experience, this kind of response to the DA is part of an emotional blind attachment to the ANC. The student obviously doesn’t know anything about the DA.</p>

<p>The national leader of the DA is a white woman, the parliamentary leader is a young black woman and the mayor of Cape Town is a coloured woman. The black and coloured portfolio and position holders in the DA are among the smartest, most committed and most impressive of any politicians in the country. The DA’s membership is highest among blacks, if not yet its voters.</p>

<p>S.C. Weiss Johannesburg  * SIR – Lamenting the deficiencies during the ANCs rule of government has become the norm in recent years. Although much of the criticism is warranted, your piece engaged in a clumsy narrative. The failure of the ANC government to properly own up to the problem of HIV/AIDS was not simply the fault of Thabo Mbeki. Nelson Mandela also failed adequately to address the issue.</p>

<p>President Mandela was a fantastic torchbearer for reconciliation, yet his presidency was not without its failings. By the end of his term many of the current problems of corruption, lack of political accountability and the re-racialisation of South African society were already emerging.</p>

<p>George Papaconstantinou</p>

<p>SIR – Your article on taxation in Greece correctly stated that when I was finance minister I requested the so-called Lagarde list of Greek accounts in a Swiss bank, and handed over the biggest 20 to the Greek financial police (“A national sport no more”, November 3rd). They did indeed turn out to be suspected tax evaders, as you said.</p>

<p>But it is completely untrue that I “never pursued the matter”. I did exactly the opposite, giving clear instructions to that effect. I repeated these upon handing the full information with all names to the new head of financial police (which he confirmed in a hearing in parliament). I left the ministry of finance in a cabinet reshuffle shortly thereafter. The information was therefore never “mislaid” by me as you claimed (the information has since been leaked and the names published). It was, however, clearly not properly investigated.</p>

<p>The discussion on the handling of the Lagarde list also obscures the fact that it was during my tenure that Greece finally started to crack down seriously on tax evasion, introducing jail terms for tax offenders, seizing property, bringing in an economic crimes prosecutor and dedicated tax courts and a complete lifting of banking secrecy. The changes introduced then have since led to high-profile people being jailed for tax offences—a first for Greece.</p>

<p>What hope for Afghanistan?</p>

<p>SIR – You reiterated the same upbeat expectations for Afghanistan that NATO officials have long trumpeted (“Towards a better land”, October 27th). Yet despite the cheerful assessment, not one Afghan army battalion can operate independently of American advisers. A third of soldiers abandon their posts and refuse to fight. How such a fragile force of phantom troops will stave off civil war after 2014 remains unexplained.</p>

<p>You maintain that “support for the Taliban is limited.” That is false comfort. The Taliban persist in the face of heavy losses with a seemingly limitless pool of recruits and cross-border sanctuary in Pakistan. Focusing on the Taliban also ignores the northern non-Pushtun insurgents, who harbour legitimate grievances against both foreign forces and the Afghan central government.</p>

<p>Finally, you think that speeding up troop withdrawals will jeopardise progress. What will undo any promising gains is not withdrawal per se, but Afghanistan’s competing nationalisms and ethnic and factional differences. Sadly, those dynamics have proven to be impervious to the presence of foreign troops. One of NATO’s biggest mistakes was to pay insufficient attention to Afghanistan’s internal politics.</p>

<p>Malou Innocent Cato Institute Washington, DC</p>

<p>* SIR – You made no mention of the costs that the Afghan conflict has imposed on neighbouring states. The International Crisis Group report you cited also says that “All stakeholders must understand that the rule of law is the most essential ingredient in the recipe for stability”. Have you checked out the ICG 2011 report on Tajikistan? How have the health and education sectors in neighbouring states fared since NATO’s Pakistan supply route was shut down?</p>

<p>China’s red aristocracy</p>

<p>SIR – A recurring theme in your coverage of China is the concentration of power and wealth among the children and grandchildren of veterans of the Long March, despite important individuals in this cohort having sometimes spent lengthy periods out of favour or in internal exile (“Vaunting the best, fearing the worst”, October 27th). The near-extermination of the former landowning classes in post-revolutionary China and their replacement in the post-Deng era by this new red aristocracy represents one of the most striking examples of the wholesale reallocation of national power and resources since the Norman conquest of England in 1066.</p>

<p>Julian Rathbone’s “The Last English King” imagines the Norman Duke William exhorting his men (with names like Hague, Howe and Waldegrave) to one final assault on the English wall by promising them and their descendants a 1,000 years of land, money and power. I wonder if the descendants of China’s red princelings will prove to be as successful in the long-term?</p>

<p>Golden oldies</p>

<p>SIR – Perhaps to demonstrate that journalists do get out occasionally you seem fond of dropping in the occasional pop-culture reference, such as starting an article on the matureness of the present young generation of Britons with a line from The Who: “I hope I die before I get old” (“The continent generation”, October 27th). May I suggest you find some pop references from after 1965? You could easily have used Robbie Williams’s 1997 hit “Old Before I Die”, or “I Hope That I Get Old Before I Die” by They Might Be Giants from 1985. Perhaps a generational shift in your record collections—we mostly listen to MP3s now—is overdue.</p>
