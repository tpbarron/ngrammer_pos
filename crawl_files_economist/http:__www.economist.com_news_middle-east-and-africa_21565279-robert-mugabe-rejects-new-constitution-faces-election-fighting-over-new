<p>A VAST billboard at the airport near Harare, the capital, depicts a motorway in rainbow hues stretching into the distance. This, it says, shows Zimbabwe’s future of peace and democracy under a new constitution. Signing up to such a document was part of a power-sharing deal agreed in 2008 by President Robert Mugabe’s Zanu-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai’s opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Alas, it has yet to happen.</p>

<p>A referendum on the constitution has been repeatedly delayed as negotiations drag on. At a “stakeholder” conference in Harare between October 21st and 23rd, about 1,200 delegates from the main political parties as well as the churches and civil society pondered the latest draft—still without agreement. The MDC says it is happy with the document. Among other things, the president would be limited to two terms. Human rights would be better protected. An independent prosecuting authority would be created along with a new constitutional court, separate from the supreme court, now packed with Mr Mugabe’s allies. Some power would shift from president to parliament.</p>

<p>Zanu-PF rejects this, saying the draft puts too many constraints on the government. It knows that without a referendum on the constitution an election expected next year will have to be held under the old system. That gives Mr Mugabe’s lot a better chance of winning by hook or by crook. The voters’ roll is still crammed with the names of children and the dead. The MDC faces intimidation in rural areas. Activists have little confidence that the electoral commission is independent.</p>

<p>Still, the MDC is hopeful that voting would be less bloody than last time, when at least 200 people died, forcing Mr Tsvangirai to abandon a presidential run-off despite beating Mr Mugabe in the first round. Jameson Timba, an MDC minister, does not rule out the possibility of violence but thinks it will not be on the same scale.</p>

<p>In any event, Zanu-PF has been heartened by a recent poll that suggests it may be clawing back popular support. Research by Freedom House, a campaigning America-based think-tank, and the local Mass Public Opinion Institute, suggests 31% of Zimbabweans would back Zanu-PF in elections, up from just 12% in 2009. Only a fifth said they backed the MDC, down from more than half three years ago. But over 40% refused to say who they would vote for, and two-thirds admitted that fear of violence and intimidation could influence voters.</p>

<p>Another rival poll by Afrobarometer, another independent research body, also showed the MDC to be flagging but put much more weight on the fear factor. According to Afrobarometer’s calculations, if waverers and the cagey don’t-knows were removed, the MDC would still beat Zanu-PF by 58% to 34%.</p>
