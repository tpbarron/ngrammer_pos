<p>IN THE mid-19th century, if you had wanted to have a scientific fight, you could have picked no better subject than palaeontology. Fossils pouring out of the mines, quarries and railway cuttings of the industrial revolution were undermining the biblical accounts of creation and early history, then believed literally true. They thus threatened Christianity.</p>

<p>You might think things would have calmed down by now, but palaeontology clearly still has argumentative genes in its DNA, as the fate of Alison Moyer at the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology, in Raleigh, North Carolina, demonstrated. On October 19th Ms Moyer, a graduate student at North Carolina State University, proposed an idea that undermines orthodoxy as much as the 19th-century rockhounds did. The difference is that this orthodoxy is scientific.</p>

<p>Four years ago a group of researchers led by Jakob Vinther of Yale University announced that they had seen grain-like bodies called melanosomes in fossil feathers, and that these bodies were arranged in interesting patterns. Thus encouraged, others followed suit. Suddenly, melanosomes were everywhere. This mattered for two reasons. First, melanosomes are organelles of pigment. That meant that it might be possible to reconstruct what ancient birds looked like. Second, it is now clear that the dinosaurs from which birds evolved also had feathers. Fossil melanosomes mean it might be possible to work out what those dinosaurs looked like, too. A lot is thus at stake. So any suggestion that what the researchers are seeing are not melanosomes is not going to be popular. But that is exactly what Ms Moyer, backed up by her supervisor Mary Schweitzer, is suggesting.</p>

<p>She thinks the grains in question might be fossil bacteria, and she has done an experiment to test this idea. She used electron microscopy to study chicken feathers that she had contaminated with soil bacteria a few days previously, and made two significant observations.</p>

<p>The first was that the microbes and the melanosomes overlapped each other both in size and in shape. She found this alarming because palaeontological papers have argued for the presence of melanosomes based only upon the sizes and shapes of the fossilised objects in question.</p>

<p>The second was that the melanosomes in her feathers were always embedded in the keratin of which the feather is made. The microbes, by contrast, grew across the surface. Most of the supposed melanosomes associated with fossil feathers have been distributed in dense mats over the surface of the feathers, rather than being embedded within them.</p>

<p>None of which went down well with several of the other delegates at the meeting. Ms Moyer’s presentation, a poster-paper of her results, was besieged by pointing fingers, clenched fists and raised voices accusing her of ignoring the work of others, failing to cite precedents and not presenting new data. The words “egregious” and “idiotic” were bandied about.</p>

<p>It is possible, of course, that Ms Moyer is wrong. Dr Vinther, in particular, explicitly considered in his paper the idea that what he had seen were bacteria—and discounted it because of the clear patterns the grains seemed to form. And several teams of researchers have investigated the chemical properties of the putative melanosomes. None has found any indication that they are bacterial. But whether Ms Moyer is correct or incorrect, she has clearly hit a raw nerve. She is, after all, pretty junior in the scientific scheme of things. Usually, the fate of such a heretic would be the worst of all—to be either ignored or patronised. Instead, she has been crucified. It is intriguing to see scientists behaving toward heresy in a way remarkably similar to that which their pious opponents once did.</p>
