<p>IN THE LIFT at 419 Park Avenue South, heading out for a bite of lunch, are four reasons why Shapeways moved its headquarters from Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, to New York. Anthony Cangelosi and Erin Keeffe are web designers; Christopher Carter is a product manager; Natalia Krasnodebska liaises with customers. Mr Cangelosi is the veteran, having clocked up nine whole months with the 3D-printing firm; the others have been there for five or less.</p>

<p>“Finding very talented people in a big city is easier than in a small town,” says Peter Weijmarshausen, Shapeways’ chief executive and one of its founders. “People like to be in a vibrant, cool city.” As well as the office in Manhattan, Shapeways has a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing site in Queens, with machines building up all manner of weird and wonderful shapes in more than 30 materials. The factory is not full yet, but Mr Weijmarshausen expects it will be by the end of this year. The company is still printing in Eindhoven too.</p>

<p>Many other young, growing firms come to tech hubs to fish in their pools of skilled labour. Mr Weijmarshausen had a further, equally important motive for coming to New York: to be close to his customers. Professional designers upload digital versions of their products to Shapeways and open virtual shops on its website. Shapeways prints the products and handles payments. Amateurs with the 3D bug have their own designs, or customised versions of other people’s, made there. New York has plenty of designers wanting to use 3D printers to create jewellery, components or beautiful shapes. Mr Weijmarshausen thinks 3D printing will hit the fashion world, too. The material in which he prints most is nylon.</p>

<p>In conventional manufacturing, economies of scale matter. With 3D printing it costs no more, per unit, to make one item than to make thousands, so refining a product is much less costly than it used to be: as designers see where improvements can be made, or receive feedback from customers, they can tweak the products as they go along. Some items printed by Shapeways go through as many as 50 iterations.</p>

<p>In a business of small batches and continuous refinements, proximity to clients is a virtue. “Showing people what is possible is very important,” says Mr Weijmarshausen. Every month Shapeways organises a walkabout at its factory. It also runs monthly “meet-ups” at which designers and buyers can share ideas. As the company grows, the boss expects to build more facilities, but he is determined to stay close to the market: “I don’t think it makes sense at all to start manufacturing in one place and ship it across the globe.”</p>
