<p>OPENTABLE WAS BORN of frustration. Why, asked Chuck Templeton, its founder, can I book a seat on an aeroplane online but not in a restaurant? So Mr Templeton set out to build an online service of his own, starting in San Francisco. In a fragmented industry of small family businesses, that meant signing up restaurants one by one. What made it harder still was that the year was 1998, when many restaurants did not even have internet connections. So OpenTable not only had to persuade restaurateurs to take its software, it often had to supply hardware too.</p>

<p>Fourteen years on, OpenTable has spread across North America and to Germany, Japan and Britain. Restaurants pay a subscription of $199 a month, plus $1 for seats filled through OpenTable’s website and 25 cents for those booked through the restaurant’s own. In the first half of this year the firm’s revenue was $79m, well over twice as much as three years earlier.</p>

<p>As OpenTable’s story shows, local services have been provided over the internet for many years. Craigslist, an online classified-advertising site, has been going since 1999. But the spread of the smartphone has made a huge difference: it is a powerful, portable computer that allows its user’s position to be tracked to within a few yards, so that he can be told all sorts of information about what is around him. Especially in America and particularly in its big cities, this has sparked a proliferation of “location-based services”—an ugly mouthful meaning, roughly, services arranged or provided online, according to where the user is. They can be anything from driving directions to discounts at local shops or restaurant reservations. Matt Roberts, OpenTable’s chief executive, says that 28% of his bookings are made from mobile devices. He expects that eventually most will be.</p>

<p>“The catalyst was clearly the iPhone,” says Jeremy Stoppelman, founder and chief executive of Yelp, which lists and reviews local businesses. “Easy access to a user’s location, passively, where they just have to open their phone and it tells you where they are: that’s really what’s led to everything.” Yelp has been around since 2004, three years before the iPhone appeared, but Mr Stoppelman says he had always thought Yelp’s content would be useful on the go. Of the 78m people who look at Yelp on the web, 25% come from its mobile website. The 7.2m who used its mobile apps at least monthly in the first half of this year account for 40% of searches.</p>

<p>As easy as one, two, three</p>

<p>Location-based services take three main forms. The first matches unmet demand with unused supply, with the middleman taking a cut. OpenTable, which tells diners where and when there is space and helps restaurants fill tables, is one example. “Daily deals” sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial, which sell special offers from local businesses, are another.</p>

<p>Services of this type are coming to the streets too. Uber, from San Francisco, has been running taxis in Boston, Chicago and Toronto as well as limousine services in several cities. Hailo, a start-up based in London whose founders include three drivers of the city’s black cabs, has taken its taxi app to Dublin and competes with Uber in Boston and Toronto. Both services work through smartphone apps that show users the nearest available cars and an estimate of how long one will take to arrive. A tap on the smartphone hails the cab.</p>

<p>Both would also like to help New Yorkers pinpoint yellow taxis. Although the streets are chock-a-block with them, finding one that will take you where you want to go can be a hair-tearing experience, especially just before a change of shift. Uber was first out of the garage in New York, in early September. But by mid-October it was back in. Travis Kalanick, the company’s chief executive, says demand was brisk but blames the city’s taxi regulator for a shortage of cabs (160 drivers took part). The regulator has said that for now taxi drivers may not accept debit- or credit-card payments through smartphones, but must use the system already installed in their cabs. Nor may they use a smartphone on the move.</p>

<p>Uber’s limos are still running and it hopes to try again with taxis next year. Hailo still expects to start a service when new rules are in place. It says 4,000 drivers have “pre-registered” for its app. Ricardo Merisme, a Haitian-born cabbie who has signed up, thinks it is a great idea for customers, especially at weekends. “On the weekend, sometimes it is slow. We don’t have a lot of taxis, especially early morning. If you can just [call] a taxi to come and get you, you would not stand outside to look for one.” There are benefits for drivers too. Jay Bregman, Hailo’s chief executive, reckons that London cabbies spend up to half of their shifts looking for fares.</p>

<p>A variation on the theme of matching supply and demand is “collaborative consumption” or the “sharing economy”. Again, idle assets are married to unmet wants, and the matchmaker takes a slice of the resulting deal. The difference is that, unlike restaurant tables or seats in taxis, the assets in question are usually private property. But for the collaborative-consumption services, they would probably not be on the market at all.</p>

<p>The point is to share unused resources that already exist and would otherwise, in effect, go to waste. This is the idea underlying ride-sharing services such as Zimride, BlablaCar, a French company, and Carpooling.com, a German one, that connect drivers and passengers who want to make the same inter-city journeys. Perhaps the best-known example of collaborative consumption is Airbnb, through which people rent out spare rooms, flats or houses to travellers looking for somewhere to stay. Most people book before they travel, but within Airbnb’s smartphone app you can also look for a bed once you have arrived, via a button marked “Help! I need a place, tonight!”</p>

<p>The second sort is the location-based social network. This may keep you in touch with your friends: on Foursquare users “check in” at cafés, bars and other places to let their pals know about their movements (perhaps with a view to meeting). Or it may introduce you to strangers whom you might like to meet—such as Badoo (which says it has “hundreds of thousands of new guys and girls joining daily”), Highlight and Banjo.</p>

<p>Another idea is to make it easier to meet your neighbours. Local groups can (and do) already create pages on Facebook, but Nirav Tolia, the founder of Nextdoor, has quietly set up more than 5,000 neighbourhood networks in 48 American states in just over a year. “Your neighbours are not your friends,” he says, but you do have a range of interests in common, from crime rates to local schools to good plumbers; or you might just want to borrow a lawnmower. “The internet has been about building virtual communities,” Mr Tolia adds. “It’s now about strengthening existing physical communities.”</p>

<p>The third form of location-based service is local information, search and listings. Yelp has been elbowing aside the Yellow Pages, providing not only phone numbers and addresses but also links to websites as well as online maps and reviews by customers. Mostly this is financed by advertising: about 70% of Yelp’s revenues come from ads by local businesses listed on its site. Trulia and Zillow allow househunters to search for properties online. On Zillow you can use your finger to draw around your preferred area on a touchscreen; on Trulia you can compare crime rates in different places. Both make their money from selling services to subscribing estate agents.</p>

<p>Some companies now span several of these categories. For instance, Foursquare is evolving into a local search engine, using the data it has amassed from members’ check-ins and recommendations. Based on where you have been in the past and what you and your friends like, it suggests places and makes offers, such as a discount on a cup of coffee. Since the middle of this month people have also been able to search its website without logging in or signing up for a Foursquare account.</p>

<p>The strength of all these services depends largely on their ability to build networks of suppliers and users. The more people join, the more are attracted in. The act of signing up ties suppliers into the network. Once a restaurant has joined OpenTable or a homeowner has subscribed to Airbnb, there is little point in going to a rival service and running the risk of double-booking.</p>

<p>Many location-based services work best in big cities, where there are lots of places to eat and lots of car seats going spare within a few square miles. They tend to start in one city and spread out. For many services San Francisco has been the starting point. It is big enough to be an urban testing ground and full of techies who can write the software to make the services work. It also has plenty of people who are willing to try them: San Franciscans seem to eat out more than most.</p>

<p>Feedback loops</p>

<p>Such services generate a lot of useful data which can strengthen a network further. Cabbies using Hailo get a record of their day’s trips and fares, from which they can see when and where they are making money. Restaurateurs using OpenTable can learn who the regular diners are and perhaps make them especially welcome when they walk through the door. Reputation can be particularly important in collaborative consumption, where the suppliers are individuals rather than businesspeople and therefore have no brand. Ratings and reviews are one method, though people sometimes pay for puffery. With Airbnb, travellers can choose to stay with Facebook friends, friends of friends or hosts recommended by friends.</p>

<p>Not everyone is glad to see new services arrive. Local regulations and politics can get in the way, especially in the taxi business, where Uber, in particular, is seen as a disruptive force. “Every city is different,” says Mr Kalanick. New York is not the only place where it has found a spoke in its wheels. In Washington, DC, local taxi drivers lobbied against competition from Uber’s limos. The city council proposed a minimum charge for Uber that was five times the price of a taxi, but relented after the company organised a brisk social-media campaign.</p>

<p>Regulators are not the only obstacle to moving into new territory. A rival may already have established itself there. BlablaCar has spread from France into Britain, Spain and Italy; but in Germany Carpooling.com is strongly entrenched and has designs on Zimride’s patch, America.</p>

<p>One way of getting into new markets is to buy your way in. In Britain Airbnb bought Crashpadder, a similar venture, and OpenTable digested toptable, a reservation and review site for smart restaurants.</p>

<p>The global giants of the internet, notably Facebook and Google, want to go much more local, too. About 7m small businesses have regularly maintained Facebook pages, which may be their only online presence. Facebook’s selling point is that its advertising platform makes it remarkably easy to go further in reaching potential customers and aim ads at finely targeted audiences selected from the network’s membership of 1 billion. Advertisers can narrow down their target audience by age, gender and tastes (expressed through Facebook’s “likes”) as well as by area. A price pops up, and a “sponsored story” can be planted. If people choose to like the ad or the company, then stories appear in their friends’ “news feeds”. Facebook has also introduced Foursquare-style check-ins and has bought Glancee, another app to help you discover interesting people nearby. It is also said to be considering restaurant reviews.</p>

<p>Google’s self-described mission is to catalogue all the world’s information and to make it searchable online. Naturally that includes local businesses, from restaurants to ironmongers, and what their users think of them. But to be comprehensive it needs content, not least more reviews (although its search results bring up reviews from other sources). To help fill that gap, it recently bought Frommer’s, a travel-guide business, and Zagat, a restaurant-review company. Still, it has other things in its favour: a powerful search engine, the brains of 33,000 Googlers, and the determination to map the world in the most intricate detail.</p>
