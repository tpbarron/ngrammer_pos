<p>“WARREN is supposed to be for the middle class, but I dunno,” said one East Boston resident as he watched Elizabeth Warren, Democratic candidate for the Senate in Massachusetts, march past in the Columbus Day parade. And that is Ms Warren’s biggest problem: convincing Massachusetts voters, especially working-class ones, that she is right for them. She is a professor and former bankruptcy lawyer. But Scott Brown, the Republican who in 2010 took the Senate seat held for nearly 47 years by Ted Kennedy, may have the edge in blue-collar appeal. He is well-liked in the state, especially among fishermen who supported Barney Frank, a Democratic congressman who is retiring.</p>

<p>Even some labour unions support him. One poll shows Mr Brown ahead among union members by 46% to 41%, and he is backed by the Massachusetts Municipal Police Coalition, a police union. Unlike many Republicans, he is not anti-union; indeed, as a former model, he belongs to the Screen Actors Guild. But many unions have endorsed Ms Warren, including the AFL-CIO, the state’s largest. The union’s rank and file are knocking on doors for her. She also has the support of Tom Menino, Boston’s long-serving Democratic mayor, who can get out the vote like no one else.</p>

<p>Both candidates are doing their best to appeal to working-class voters, raising some $60m to do it: the most ever raised for a Senate race in the Bay State. Neither has been shy about invoking their modest backgrounds. She, the daughter of a caretaker, became a Harvard professor and later worked for the president. He had a traumatic childhood marked by hunger, neglect and physical abuse. Ms Warren boasts that she fought for the consumer in Washington. Mr Brown brags about his pick-up truck. Blue-collar towns like Lowell—considered the cradle of America’s industrial revolution—are crucial to both of them, and both have paid several visits.</p>

<p>Debates between the two have been heated. Mr Brown has attempted to cast doubt on Ms Warren’s claims of American-Indian blood, suggesting this was a ruse to get preferential treatment; his staffers at a recent campaign event made tomahawk-chops and war whoops, though Mr Brown called their behaviour “unacceptable”.</p>

<p>In campaign ads, Mr Brown brags about his independence and his bipartisan leanings. His favourite Supreme Court justice is Antonin Scalia, a conservative, yet he may not support the conservative Mitch McConnell for majority leader if the Republicans take the Senate. “That’s the beauty of being independent,” he says. “When I walk in, I can go and vote however I want.” He has distanced himself from Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, who trails Barack Obama in state polls, and recently tweeted that he was “proud to have worked with Pres Obama” to help ex-servicemen get jobs.</p>

<p>All this has helped him win endorsements from prominent Democrats like Ray Flynn, a former mayor of Boston. And it means that Ms Warren is only just leading in most polls. According to a Boston Globe poll, one in five votes is still up for grabs. As Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report notes, “For the first time in a long time, there is a real race in Massachusetts.”</p>
