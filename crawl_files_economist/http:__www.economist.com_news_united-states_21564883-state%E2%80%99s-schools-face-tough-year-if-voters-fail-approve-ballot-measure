<p>IN CALIFORNIA, where Republicans wielding power have been hunted to extinction, most political debates take place exclusively on the left. Sometimes this works well enough. But on occasion it produces a spectacle of singular bloodiness. The row over Proposition 30, a tax-raising measure that the state’s voters will consider in November, is one such case.</p>

<p>Prop 30, as it is universally known, would temporarily lift the state’s sales tax by 0.25 percentage points and, less temporarily but more vitally, raise income-tax rates on the wealthy. Much of the $6 billion raised annually would be directed to schools and colleges, going some way to repair the damage done by years of cuts. This week Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor, stepped up his campaign for the measure with a tour of Californian campuses.</p>

<p>Speaking at UCLA, Mr Brown identified complacency as the enemy. A potentially more dangerous foe was left unnamed. Mr Brown has found himself up against Molly Munger, a rich lawyer who is bankrolling an alternative ballot measure. Proposition 38 would raise taxes further than Prop 30 and send most of the revenues straight to schools, bypassing the state government. If voters approve both, the measure that secures most support will be enacted.</p>

<p>That looks unlikely: Ms Munger’s measure is struggling in the polls. Prop 30, on the other hand, was until recently winning the support of most voters. But then the gloves came off. Television spots for Prop 38 began claiming that if Prop 30 passed, politicians might find other uses for the revenues it raised. At around the same time one of Ms Munger’s brothers donated $10m to a committee devoted to, among other things, trashing Prop 30.</p>

<p>Under heavy fire, this week Ms Munger’s campaign dropped its attack ad, claiming gamely that it had made its point. It is too early to know if blood has been drawn, but the most recent poll (conducted before the ads were aired) found support for Prop 30 at just 49.5%. The pollster, California Business Roundtable, said it expected that number to fall further.</p>

<p>This is bad news for Mr Brown, who has tied his political fortunes to his ballot measure. It is worse news for California’s schools and colleges, for the revenues Prop 30 would raise are baked into the budget Mr Brown pushed through the Assembly in June. If it fails, almost $6 billion will automatically be slashed from education budgets.</p>

<p>Californians are already highly taxed; but they prize education, and Mr Brown’s gun-to-the-temple tactic may yet see Prop 30 through. Some opponents suggest that even if it fails, the trigger-cuts could be avoided by tweaking the budget after November. But Mr Brown has denied this so emphatically that it is hard to see him going back on his word.</p>

<p>To other critics, Mr Brown has adopted the disarming posture of basically agreeing with them. Yes, there would have been better ways to plug the fiscal gap, perhaps by slapping taxes on the extractive industries, but alas, that would galvanise too much opposition. Regrettably, Prop 30 will worsen the state’s dependence on the volatile income of a small number of wealthy residents. But hey, Mr Brown is a politician, not a policy wonk.</p>

<p>Mr Brown still has cause for cheer. He has won backing from business groups and endorsements from most of California’s big newspapers (mostly of the “hold your nose” variety). The campaign for Prop 30 has raised far more money than the (formal) opposition has.</p>

<p>As for the deeper question of why voters are being asked to rule on a matter that in most places would be reserved to legislators, the short answer is that tax increases in California need a two-thirds majority to pass—a threshold too high even in this Democratic stronghold. The longer answer is that politics and tax policy have a uniquely destructive relationship in this state, and that the fate of one piece of fiscal legislation will do little to change that.</p>
