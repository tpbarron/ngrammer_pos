<p>DURING the third presidential debate Barack Obama said that Americans had heard “way too many TV commercials” about the race. Yet that has not stopped his campaign from continuing to bombard voters with advertisements depicting Mitt Romney as a devious, tax-dodging outsourcer, hell bent on raising taxes on the struggling middle class, gutting popular government programmes and undermining women’s rights. “Romney’s never stood up to China,” intones the narrator in one, as an image of a sweatshop flashes up on the screen. “All he’s done is send them our jobs.”</p>

<p>Mr Romney, for his part, suggests that Mr Obama is an unprincipled incompetent, who has allowed debt to balloon, jobs to evaporate, religious freedom to be trampled and the American dream to be eviscerated. “Doesn’t America deserve better”, the narrator asks, as Mr Obama grins widely, “than a president who will say or do anything to stay in power?”</p>

<p>American elections are fought mainly on the airwaves—and every four years, inevitably, the combat becomes more intense and more gruesome. This year Borrell Associates, a research firm, expects some $7.4 billion to be spent on television and radio advertising tied to all this year’s elections. On current showings, there will be almost 50% more ads than in 2008 in the presidential race alone, according to the Wesleyan Media Project, an academic monitoring group. The advertisements are increasingly concentrated in the ten or so swing states, and the vast majority of them are negative (see chart), a trend that becomes more pronounced with each election. In the three weeks to the end of September, just 8% of the ads in the presidential race were devoted to praising a candidate, rather than denigrating him.</p>

<p>Since the start of the campaign, Mr Obama and his supporters have warned that big-spending right-wing groups were about to release a torrent of ads that would skew the race in Mr Romney’s favour. In anticipation of this tide, the Obama campaign started advertising heavily over the summer, aiming to get their message over before it could be drowned out. The Romney campaign, the assumption went, would also have more money to spend once it could get at funds earmarked for the general-election campaign, after the Republican convention formally nominated its candidate in late August.</p>

<p>So far, however, the flood has not appeared. Outside groups have been spending heavily on Mr Romney’s behalf, but chiefly to close the gap between his relatively meagre outlays and the Obama campaign’s more lavish ones. From late April, when Mr Romney clinched the Republican nomination, until October 21st, Mr Obama and his allies spent $275m on advertising to the Romney camp’s $319m, according to the Wesleyan Project.</p>

<p>What is more, those figures understate Mr Obama’s presence on the airwaves, since his money went further. He and his allies aired 521,675 ads, according to the project’s tally, to 469,539 for Mr Romney. That is partly because the Obama campaign booked its ads earlier, locking in cheaper rates. What is more, campaigns themselves, as opposed to parties or other outsiders advertising on a candidate’s behalf, are entitled to cheaper rates by law. So the fact that roughly half of the spending in favour of Mr Romney comes from independent outfits such as American Crossroads and Restore Our Future is something of a handicap.</p>

<p>Mr Obama has also spread his ads more widely, with a bigger share appearing on cable channels. That allows more careful targeting of specific groups of voters with tailored messages: housewives via daytime soaps and cooking shows, for example, or Hispanics via Spanish-language channels. Mr Romney’s campaign has followed a more conventional model, with more ads aired during news programmes, and less variation in their scripting. The thrust has remained very consistent on both sides, however, with Mr Romney focusing on the feeble state of the economy under Mr Obama, and Mr Obama casting aspersions on Mr Romney’s character and achievements.</p>

<p>There is still a chance of a right-wing advertising surge in the final weeks of the race. This week Restore Our Future said it was launching an $18m campaign in ten swing states. American Crossroads and its sister group, Crossroads GPS, will spend at least $12m a week bolstering Mr Romney for the remainder of the campaign. But at this stage, says Jonathan Collegio of the Crossroads groups, with near-saturation of the airwaves, voters are more sceptical of political ads, making them harder to convince. He does not speak of swamping Mr Obama’s effort, but of keeping pace.</p>

<p>Such a stalemate is to be expected, says Lynn Vavreck of the University of California, Los Angeles. Candidates seek to neutralise one another’s advantages, and plan and budget accordingly. Moreover, the effects of political ads are so fleeting, she argues, that it is hard to gain a lasting advantage. Measurable impacts on polls, she says, tend to appear only when there is a clear disparity between one candidate and another on the airwaves, and even then they will largely dissipate within 48 hours. To deprive their opponents of that elusive boost, both sides will keep up their relentless barrage until the bitter end.</p>
