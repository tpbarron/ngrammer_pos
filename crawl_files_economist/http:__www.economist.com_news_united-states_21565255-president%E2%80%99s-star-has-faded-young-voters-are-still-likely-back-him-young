<p>PAUL RYAN’S speech to the Republican convention in late August contained a cracking line. “College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms,” said the Republican vice-presidential nominee, “staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can…get going with life.”</p>

<p>As Mr Ryan’s words suggest, the Republican strategy for youth voters is to harness disappointment with Barack Obama’s presidency. Television ads for Mitt Romney show earnest youngsters scornfully intoning the 2008 slogans they once found so inspiring. After a four-year failed experiment with hope, these voters seem to be saying, it’s time for change.</p>

<p>The strategy seems sound. Young voters backed Mr Obama by such a huge margin in 2008 (66% to John McCain’s 32%) that the Republicans have no choice but to hope they can turn some of the disillusioned. The economic message seems on point, too. The unemployment rate for 18- to 29-year-olds stands at 11.8% (although despite Mr Ryan’s appeal, it is far higher for young people without college experience). There are so many with work but not enough of it that MTV has given them a drama series: the first episode of “Underemployed” aired last week.</p>

<p>But something is muffling the message: Mr Obama is still winning the young vote by some distance. In early October a Harvard Institute of Politics poll found 55% support for Mr Obama among under-30s, next to 36% for Mr Romney. The lead, though, was slightly smaller in the all-important swing states, which could be good news for the challenger, who needs to perform only a bit better than Mr McCain did four years ago to win.</p>

<p>Some of this may represent the lingering potency of a candidacy that, four years ago, in the Democratic primaries and then in the presidential race, roused many youngsters to a state of near-mania. (Curiously, though, turnout was barely up on 2004.) Today voters aged 25 to 29, who were of voting age in 2008, prefer Mr Obama in much larger numbers than 18- to 24-year-olds, many of whom were not.</p>

<p>But the young also prefer Mr Obama’s message. Respondents to the Harvard poll rated the president more highly than his opponent in each of seven policy areas they were asked to consider. Just 28% said they preferred Mr Romney’s economic policies. And just as Mr McCain’s selection of Sarah Palin failed to impress the young electorate four years ago, 40% of young voters say the presence of Mr Ryan’s name on the Republican ticket makes them much less likely to vote for it.</p>

<p>Mr Romney can win the presidency without winning the youth vote. But he should be doing better. Young support for Democrats is not written in the stars. Almost as many under-30s describe themselves as conservative (33%) as liberal (37%). Most voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 and the first George Bush in 1988.</p>

<p>Still, the effects of any Obama landslide among the young this year will be weaker than they might have been. “All the signs are pointing to a decrease in turnout” over 2008, says John Della Volpe, polling director for the Harvard institute. Student recruiters and university professors report a muted atmosphere on campuses, and Mr Obama’s regular college visits have not come close to attracting the stadium-sized crowds of 2008. In its polling throughout 2012 the Pew Centre has found that just half of young voters claim to be registered to vote; lower than at any time since 1996, when the centre began asking.</p>

<p>The quieter mood this year reminds Heather Smith, president of Rock the Vote, which organises voter-registration drives among the young, of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. In 2008, she says, young voters would weep tears of frustration when told they had missed the deadline to register during the primaries. This year few paid attention until Labour Day.</p>

<p>Are they too wrapped up in their own lives? Hardly. Few young voters today resemble the placard-wielding idealists of the late 1960s and early 1970s, even if they are more liberal than their elders on issues like gay marriage and immigration. But neither are they well captured by the idea of the Generation-X slacker, a specimen of the 1990s whose solipsistic regard helped depress turnout rates during that decade.</p>

<p>Today’s “millennials”, the term of art preferred by most analysts, volunteer in large numbers, lead active civic lives and profess interest in politics. But, says Mr Della Volpe, despite this “service gene” they don’t particularly believe in voting and have lost trust in political institutions. Their immediate elders came of age around 9/11 and were galvanised, in many cases, by the faults of the George W. Bush administration. Mr Obama connected strongly with them. But since 2008 the story has been the inability of government to protect citizens from the ravages of recession. What can a vote do to change that?</p>

<p>This year, the tightness of the race and the disengagement of the young have forced both campaigns to focus on getting their respective votes out. The slight edge Mr Romney enjoys in enthusiasm may be neutralised by the stronger organisation of Mr Obama’s ground campaign. But either way, it’s back to business as usual.</p>
