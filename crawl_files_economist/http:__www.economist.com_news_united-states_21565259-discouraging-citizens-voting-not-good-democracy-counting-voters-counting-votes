<p>SKIN colour and poverty kept Raymond Rutherford’s parents, black South Carolinians who lived in the first half of the last century, from voting. Civil-rights legislation ended de facto racial bans in the 1960s. When South Carolina first passed its voter-identification law, Mr Rutherford feared a clerical error would keep him from voting. He lacked a photographic identity card, and needed a birth certificate to get one. Unfortunately, the name on his birth certificate was Ramon Croskey. Like many black southerners of his era, Mr Rutherford, who is 59, was born at home rather than in hospital. The midwife who delivered him happened to be a friend of his mother’s, whose surname was Croskey. Such errors are not uncommon. Midwives often registered several births at once, sometimes days after they occurred; names were inevitably garbled. Trying to get a photo-ID in the name of Raymond Rutherford—the name on his tax returns, pay-stubs and school records—led to a Kafkaesque ordeal of record searches and large lawyers’ fees.</p>

<p>According to the Brennan Centre, a policy think-tank and advocacy group, around 11% of all American voters lack government-issued photo-ID. That percentage is far higher among minorities, students, the poor, the disabled and the elderly.</p>

<p>Since 2011 nine states have enacted—and 34 have considered—laws requiring voters to show photo-ID in order to vote. Some require a government-issued photo-ID, such as a driving licence or a passport; others will accept a university ID card with a picture. Not all will be in place for the coming election, and the four states with the strictest ID laws—Kansas, Tennessee, Georgia and Indiana—are all safely Republican.</p>

<p>Some have been rolled back. A federal court blocked a photo-ID law in Texas, ruling that “it imposes strict, unforgiving burdens on the poor, and racial minorities in Texas are disproportionately likely to live in poverty.” Wisconsin’s law has been declared unconstitutional. On October 2nd a judge in Pennsylvania blocked that state from implementing its voter-ID law in time for the election, ruling that it risks disenfranchising too many voters (which has not stopped Pennsylvania’s State Department from mounting an ad campaign that has been accused of implying that ID is required in order to vote). A federal appeals court has approved South Carolina’s law for 2013, but that law has been watered down from the one that passed in 2011: voters without photo-ID can vote as long as they sign a statement explaining what “reasonable impediment” prevented them from getting one.</p>

<p>But photo-ID laws are not the only ones affecting access to the voting booth. Several states—including the battlegrounds of Florida, New Mexico and Colorado—have enacted laws that make it harder for third-party groups to register voters. Five states have enacted laws reducing early-voting periods. Florida and Colorado have both tried to purge their voter rolls of non-citizens, who cannot vote, but they used inaccurate lists to do so. As a result, thousands of eligible voters received letters warning them they would be removed from the voter rolls unless they could prove their citizenship. Florida’s secretary of state warned at first that as many as 180,000 non-citizens were registered to vote; the number turned out to be 207. In Colorado the number dived from 11,000 to 141.</p>

<p>Proponents of such laws, who tend to be Republican, reject comparisons with the Jim Crow laws of the 19th and 20th centuries. Instead, they cast them as a bulwark against voting fraud. Opponents see a darker purpose. They point out that in-person voter fraud, which voter-ID laws prevent, is vanishingly rare. They note the disproportionate appearance of Latinos and other Democratic-leaning minorities among voters targeted by voter-roll purges. They note that weekend early-voting is often used by black churches, who take “souls to the polls” after Sunday services.</p>

<p>They note the overwhelming advantage Barack Obama enjoyed among first-time voters, and see restrictions on registration as a way to dampen that group’s influence by reducing their numbers. More broadly, they claim that Republicans, faced with a choice between crafting a message that appeals to the broadest possible swathe of an increasingly diverse electorate and doing everything possible to push back against demography by keeping likely Democratic voters from casting ballots, have chosen the latter course.</p>

<p>Loose-lipped Republicans have done their side no favours. Mike Turzai, a Republican in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives, boasted that his state’s voter-ID law “is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.” A Republican official in Franklin County, Ohio, writing of his state’s decision to limit early-voting, said: “We shouldn’t contort the voting process to accommodate the urban [ie, heavily black] voter-turnout machine.” The national elections co-ordinator of True the Vote, a group that trains poll workers and believes that “fraud and law-breaking has [sic] become all too common in our electoral system”, says he wants voters to feel “that they are driving and seeing the police following” them.</p>

<p>More candid Republicans might admit that these laws are all just part of the turnout game that both sides play. They help Republicans, just as generous absentee- and early-voting laws help Democrats. But a qualitative difference exists between laws that encourage citizens to take part in choosing their rulers and laws that discourage them from doing so.</p>
