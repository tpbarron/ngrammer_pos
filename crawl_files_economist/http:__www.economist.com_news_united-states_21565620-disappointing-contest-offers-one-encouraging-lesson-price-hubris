<p>EXAMINED from close up, this has been a dismaying election. Too often the 2012 presidential campaign has thrown up large topics for debate—the role of government, the limits of welfare, or how to square globalisation with the American dream—only to argue about them in small ways. Too much stress has been laid on the candidates’ characters, life stories or personal good faith. Too little has been laid on the feasibility of their policies.</p>

<p>Record-breaking sums have been spent on torrents of negative advertising. In the race’s last days neither Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney has hesitated to betray virtues that are supposed to define them. Mr Obama—who in 2004 enraptured a party convention by rejecting the division of America by race or ideology—has run an advertisement in the swing state of Ohio, accusing his rival of plotting to kill the car industry, closing with the horrid slogan: “Mitt Romney. Not one of us.” Mr Romney is a convinced free-trader with expertise in turning round underperforming businesses. But in Ohio he has run an election-eve ad denouncing Fiat, owners of the Jeep brand, for presuming to increase that business by supplying Chinese buyers from a local production line, or, as his rustbelt-pandering spot puts it: “Obama…sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China.”</p>

<p>Yet take a step back, and this small-minded, mean election points to a big, reassuring constant of American politics. Pitted against each other in contests turbocharged by partisanship and pots of money, politicians often overreach. Such partisan ferocity can pay dividends in election contests, notably by revving up the base in congressional or local districts whose boundaries can be gerrymandered to favour one side. But in time, and especially at the national level, overreach tends to be penalised. Encouragingly often the democratic system self-corrects. Time and again, the big landmarks and waypoints of this election have involved instances of each side going too far and paying a price.</p>

<p>Should Mr Obama lose, post-mortems will start with the first presidential debate in Denver on October 3rd, at which a listless Mr Obama seemed to wish himself elsewhere. The quirks of the president’s psyche must await judgment by historians. But the first debate was also a game-changer because Mr Obama’s campaign had overdone the attack ads that ran in swing states all summer. These portrayed Mr Romney, a former private-equity boss, as an elitist, unpatriotic avatar for globalisation and the outsourcing of jobs, successfully driving down Mr Romney’s poll ratings for likeability and empathy with ordinary folk. But that success was double-edged. When live television showed millions of debate viewers that the Republican was not, in fact, a cat-stroking Bond villain, their collective surprise jolted the race.</p>

<p>Remarkable amounts of political oxygen were consumed by a speech in which Mr Obama said businessmen “did not build” their enterprises alone, chiding entrepreneurs not to forget government help with schools, roads, fire brigades and so on. It could have been a pertinent point in a campaign much concerned with the merits of individual and collective action, but Mr Obama overdid the finger-wagging, marvelling at the successful people he met who think they are “just so smart”.</p>

<p>The moment suggested that the president is more statist than Middle America, and a bit priggish too. But Republicans over egged their response. Whole days at their national convention were themed around the row. The spectacle of (overwhelmingly white) delegates chanting “We did build it,” in tones of peevish self-congratulation, looked like a party talking to itself.</p>

<p>Before that, Mr Romney’s first months as the presumptive nominee had been a study in frustration. His campaign only took off after the convention, when he tacked aggressively to the centre, ditching conservative shibboleths on everything from contraception to foreign policy. The reasons for that shift were not infinitely mysterious. To adapt a phrase, primaries have consequences. Forced to call himself “severely conservative” to win his party’s nomination, Mr Romney ended up too far from the independents he needed for a general-election majority.</p>

<p>The primaries’ excessive ferocity also left the nominee on the wrong side of the demographic future. Mr Obama recently told an Iowa newspaper that if he is re-elected, a “big reason” would be that Mr Romney and the Republicans have alienated Latinos, the fastest-growing group in America. The president was right, just as he was right to credit George W. Bush with being shrewder about immigration than today’s Republicans. Sooner or later Republicans will have to correct their nativist overreach. Mr Romney (who attacked primary opponents, with shameful gusto, for being soft on immigration) has yet to acknowledge this.</p>

<p>Partisan hubris, meet electoral nemesis</p>

<p>There has been tactical overreach among less exalted Republicans too. In battlegrounds from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin, Florida and Ohio, Republican state legislators pushed through new requirements for voters to show photo-ID, or moved to restrict the days on which polls would be open for early voting—only to see judges strike many of their schemes down as unconstitutional or likely to harm poor and minority voters. In Ohio and Florida, first tallies suggest that black and Hispanic Democrats have been fired up to vote early or by post, in a direct reaction to what they see as attempted Republican voter suppression. In several key Senate races, tea-party zealotry has once again saddled the Republican Party with unhelpfully extreme candidates.</p>

<p>Both Mr Obama and Mr Romney head to election day trumpeting their moderation. Will the winner remember such caution, amid the head-turning thrill of victory? The temptation to overreach is never far away. Happily, in American politics, punishment for those who succumb is often close behind.</p>
