<p>LIFE in parts of America may soon be easier for gays, gamblers, hunters, potheads, euthanisers, car-insurance salesmen, grammarians and horses. The 174 measures that have reached the ballot across 38 states this November include the usual array of tax proposals, bond issues and constitutional tweaks. An unusually high number of referendums, in which voters can reject laws passed by legislators, reflects the polarisation of state politics. But votes in several states will provide an insight into America’s changing mores.</p>

<p>Take gay marriage. Advocates have lost 34 of 35 statewide votes since 1998 (the exception, in Arizona in 2006, was overturned in another vote two years later). But now most Americans say they favour extending marriage rights to gay couples. Four states will vote in November.</p>

<p>In Maine, Maryland and Washington, where successful outcomes would allow gay marriage, polls find slim majorities in favour. Minnesota, where voters will consider a constitutional ban, is too close to call. Foes of gay marriage note that polls tend to exaggerate their rivals’ case. But the odds are that marriage equality will soon see its first lasting victory at the ballot-box.</p>

<p>If so, couples in Washington who are so minded may ultimately be able to celebrate not with champagne but with a spliff. That state, along with Colorado and Oregon, will vote on whether to legalise possession of small amounts of marijuana for all users (no such measure has passed a statewide ballot before). Arkansas and Massachusetts will vote on whether to join the 17 states that have legalised the drug for medical purposes, and Montana on whether to liberalise a law that already exists. As with gay marriage, polls show that the long efforts of campaigners have started to liberalise public opinion.</p>

<p>Elsewhere there is red meat for conservatives. Proposals for constitutional protection of hunting and fishing, favoured by the National Rifle Association, have qualified in four states. Symbolic votes on whether to implement Barack Obama’s health-care act will be held in five states (in two, Florida and Montana, abortion is also on the ballot). Two states will consider whether to require two-thirds legislative majorities for tax rises, an experiment which has not always proved successful.</p>

<p>In California, ballot measures are so numerous that they are spoken of as if they were episodes of “Friends”: Proposition 35 is the one about human trafficking; 37 the one about genetically modified food. The signature-gathering needed to place measures on the California ballot is never pretty, but this year a surprising number of initiatives have qualified simply because someone wealthy has decided that it shall be so. The 11 measures on the ballot have between them attracted $350m, according to Maplight, a watchdog.</p>

<p>In this cycle the measures to watch in California are 30, a tax-raising initiative whose decline in the polls has led to an increasingly panicky campaign by Jerry Brown, the governor and its main backer; and 32, which would severely curtail the ability of trade unions to fund politicians and campaigns—a worry for the Democrats. (Unions face a happier prospect in Michigan, where there is a proposal to enshrine the right to collective bargaining.)</p>

<p>There are also signs of mellowing in the state that pioneered tough incarceration policies. Proposition 36, which should pass, would slightly soften California’s much-imitated “three-strikes” law, by allowing judges discretion in the sentencing of offenders whose third offence is relatively minor. And Proposition 34 would eliminate the death penalty, which has not been used in California since 2006.</p>

<p>An important education vote takes place in Georgia, where a vicious battle has been waged over whether to expand the role of the state in approving charter schools. In Washington state, a campaign to introduce charter schools is backed by the millions of Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Microsoft’s co-founders.</p>

<p>There are no absurdities this year to match, say, Oklahoma’s 2010 vote (later struck down) to ban courts from using sharia law in their deliberations. But fans of American electoral arcana can turn to North Dakota, where Measure 5 takes aim at those who inflict harm on cats, dogs or horses; and to Oregon, where Measure 78 promises improvements to the constitution’s spelling and grammar. And they say voting changes nothing.</p>
