<p>CHRIS CHRISTIE, New Jersey’s governor, ordered Atlantic City’s 12 casinos to close before superstorm Sandy came ashore. When Hurricane Irene caused a similar three-day shutdown last year, the casinos lost $45m-worth of business. This time Moody’s Investors Service expects the earnings of Atlantic City’s casinos to fall by 40-50% over the next two quarters. Little wonder then that, within 90 minutes of Mr Christie lifting Atlantic City’s evacuation order and allowing the casinos to resume operations on November 2nd, the Golden Nugget reopened. Others soon followed. Still, many casino floors remain quiet. And some guests at the Golden Nugget are not gamblers. The hotel is housing Red Cross staff, out-of-state coastguard members and teams from Alabama Power, who are working in the area to restore electricity.</p>

<p>Normality is still far away for many of those affected by the storm, which killed at least 119 Americans and affected 15 states, an area larger than Western Europe. Nearly 673,000 customers in the region are still without power, and temperatures are falling. Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, is losing patience with the utility companies and has threatened to revoke their licences. Handmade signs in still-dark areas warn looters they will be shot. Those without power are forced to use “warming centres” (emergency shelters) and temporary showers. Owners of small businesses struggle to remain open, even with help from insurance and the Small Business Administration, a federal agency.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands are homeless, with many staying in shelters. Some, including Andrew Ragati, a New Jersey policeman, queue up at the makeshift offices of FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) to file claims. Mr Ragati, who has lost his Point Pleasant beach house, is no stranger to devastation. He saw the worst of Hurricane Katrina when he was with the coastguard. He sees the same looks on New Jersey faces that he saw in 2005.</p>

<p>Transport is still difficult. Some tunnels are still under water. People in New York and New Jersey often wait hours for petrol—which is also needed to run power generators—only to find that supplies have run out. Mr Christie decided to ration fuel in New Jersey, which helped a bit. John Liu, New York City’s comptroller, estimates that the long queues at petrol stations have cost New Yorkers $100m in wasted time. The economic impact is significant. EQECAT, a risk-modelling firm, has doubled its forecast insured-loss estimates to $10 billion-20 billion, and has increased its total economic damage estimates to $30 billion-50 billion.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, another storm arrived this week, promising more surges as well as snow. Nursing homes in Rockaway, an area of New York City hammered last week by the storm surge, have been evacuated. Areas near the Jersey Shore have also been evacuated. Worried about high winds, sanitation workers and the army have worked around the clock to remove debris. FEMA has temporarily suspended operations at its three centres on Staten Island, a badly hit area which had felt neglected in the days after Sandy.</p>

<p>Disastrous storms may well become the norm. One firm predicts that catastrophe losses will double every decade because of growing population density on the coasts. It is projected that, by 2020, 39% of Americans will live in shoreline counties. In New Jersey alone, 235,000 people live less than five feet above the high-water mark. Rebuilding will have to take this into account. Some question the sense of rebuilding in flood zones; yet tourist spots like the Jersey Shore, with its 217 miles of white Atlantic beaches, are an economic engine for the state, generating $38 billion last year. Tourism-related jobs count for nearly 10% of all jobs in New Jersey. And even in disaster there are symbols of hope. A roller-coaster which once sat on a pier in Seaside Heights now stands, badly damaged, in the ocean. Not unlike New Jersey: battered, waterlogged, but still there.</p>
