<p>A DAY after receiving a thumbs-up from voters, Barack Obama got a thumbs-down from the stockmarket, which fell 2%, its biggest fall in a year. Blame the threat of higher taxes on dividends and capital gains and tougher treatment of banks and fossil fuels, but blame also the sad fact that the election failed to resolve the biggest question hanging over the economy: how to deal with the deficit.</p>

<p>Mr Obama needs to come up with an answer, fast. Within two months some $700 billion of tax increases and spending cuts kick in (roughly 5% of GDP over a full year—see table). So much austerity so quickly would suffocate the recovery. But moving the cliff leaves the underlying problem intact: on current policies the deficit, 7% of GDP in the last fiscal year, will still be over 5% a decade from now, and the debt held by the public will climb from 73% of GDP to 90%.</p>

<p>The assumption in the Obama administration and Congress is that these problems will be addressed in two steps. A smaller deal to be struck by year-end would extend most of George W. Bush’s tax cuts temporarily, delay the automatic cuts to defence and other spending (the “sequester”), and raise the legal ceiling on issuing new debt, which the Treasury Department thinks will hit by mid-February after various book-keeping tricks are exhausted. A deal does not absolutely have to be struck by December 31st. Treasury can extend current tax-withholding rates, and the administration can rearrange agency spending to delay the moment the sequester bites; but only if a deal is in sight. The second step would be a “grand bargain” next year on long-term tax and entitlement reform.</p>

<p>The prospect of such a deal depends heavily on whether the two sides are in any better mood to compromise than they were last year. Since they have spent the past six months spitting at each other instead of negotiating, they will start almost from scratch, probably with a proposal from Mr Obama soon after Congress reconvenes on November 13th. Mr Obama’s re-election will embolden him to stand firm against extending Mr Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthy, betting that Republicans will shoulder the blame if everyone’s taxes go up in January as they will if there is no deal. John Boehner, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Republicans were open to “additional revenues via tax reform,” i.e. lower rates and fewer tax deductions. In his own acceptance speech, Mr Obama did not mention raising rates, but “reducing our deficit (and) reforming our tax code”.</p>

<p>Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, was more pugnacious, saying: “Voters have not endorsed the failures or excesses of the president’s first term.” Still, Andy Laperriere of ISI Group, a broker, thinks Mr Obama could find enough Senate Republicans to allow him to pass a deal that increased taxes on the wealthy if he raised the definition of wealthy from an annual income of at least $250,000 to $1m. Mr Boehner might then allow the House to vote on such a deal, which would be carried with mostly Democratic votes.</p>

<p>Administration officials could also agree to cutting several hundred billion dollars in spending as a down-payment on deficit reduction, to placate Republicans, replace the sequester, and stave off downgrades to America’s credit rating. They harbour hopes of folding in some near-term stimulus, perhaps infrastructure spending.</p>

<p>Both sides want a short-term deal linked to a longer-term one that raises revenue by reforming the tax code and slowing the growth in entitlement spending. Though Mr Obama snubbed his own commission’s $4 trillion, ten-year debt-reduction plan when it was released in late 2010, he warmed to it during the campaign. He called the cliff a “forcing mechanism” to achieve something similar. During previous failed efforts to reach a grand bargain, both sides agreed, however briefly, to important concessions: Mr Boehner to raise $800 billion in revenue through tax reform, Mr Obama to a higher Medicare retirement age and less generous inflation protection for Social Security benefits. Some $2 trillion of miscellaneous cuts to defence, Medicaid and other programmes had previously been identified. Yet the barriers to such a bargain are daunting. One is the frayed relations between the key players. A signal will be Mr Obama’s choice to succeed Tim Geithner, his outgoing treasury secretary. The leading inside candidate is thought to be his chief of staff, Jack Lew, whom Republicans saw as obstructionist during previous negotiations. An external candidate with strong ties to business or Congress would do a lot more to build confidence.</p>

<p>Another problem is how to ensure in advance that rewriting the tax code and entitlements, which could easily take a year, produces the promised deficit reduction. Despite their high-minded rhetoric, neither Democrats nor Republicans relish the political blowback that comes with cutting entitlements and tax breaks. It might be different if they had a mandate from voters to do it. Sadly, neither Mr Obama nor Mr Romney thought to ask for one.</p>
