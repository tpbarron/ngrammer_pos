<p>Vikram Pandit resigned as chief executive of Citigroup after a rumoured spat with the board. Mr Pandit took the job in December 2007 and navigated the bank through the global financial crunch, during which it reported huge losses. The bank returned to an annual profit in 2010. But setbacks this year, including a poor showing in the Federal Reserve’s stress tests and an ill-tempered shareholders’ revolt over executive pay, seem to have prompted Mr Pandit’s departure. His successor is Mike Corbat, a Citi veteran. See article</p>

<p>Striving for independence</p>

<p>Royal Bank of Scotland ended its participation in the British Treasury’s Asset Protection Scheme, an asset-insurance scheme run by the government, which it joined in 2009. Though taxpayers still hold a majority stake in the bank, its exit from the programme is an important step on the road to full private ownership. The news came after Spain’s Santander unexpectedly decided to pull out of a deal to buy 316 of RBS’s high-street branches.</p>

<p>The Spanish government breathed a sigh of relief when Moody’s decided not to downgrade Spain’s credit rating to junk status, for now.

And Crédit Agricole, a French bank, sold its sorrowful Greek banking operations for €1 ($1.30). See article</p>

<p>Knight Capital, a high-speed trading company at the centre of a glitch on August 1st that caused stocks to swing wildly on the New York Stock Exchange, reported a $390m quarterly loss, mostly because of its error.

<p>China’s GDP grew by 7.4% in the third quarter, its slowest pace since early 2009. China’s cooling economy is a drag on global growth but there are signs of improvement: China’s exports surged in September and industrial production and investment picked up.</p>

<p>No shelter</p>

<p>Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, signed an agreement with Singapore that strengthens measures against German citizens trying to evade tax through bank accounts in the city state, which is a growing hub for parking offshore wealth.

<p>Britain’s Serious Fraud Office dropped its three-year investigation into Kaupthing, a failed Icelandic bank, because of insufficient proof.

<p>Softbank, a Japanese telecoms company, agreed to buy a 70% stake in Sprint Nextel, America’s third-biggest wireless carrier. The $20 billion deal is the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese firm. Softbank was founded in 1981 by Masayoshi Son, who is now Japan’s second-richest man. His injection of new capital will help Sprint build a zippy 4G network to compete with AT&T and Verizon Wireless. See article</p>

<p>More data suggested that America’s housing market is on the rebound, as the number of new homes being built swelled by 35% in September compared with the same month last year.

<p>BP and its Russian partners in TNK-BP looked set to sell their joint venture to Rosneft, Russia’s state-controlled oil giant. BP’s nine-year relationship with its Russian shareholders has been lucrative but fraught with arguments and threats of lawsuits. The agreement with Rosneft will enable BP to continue exploring huge reserves of oil and gas in the Russian Arctic. See article</p>

<p>Exxon Mobil struck a deal to take over Celtic Exploration, a Canadian oil-and-gas company. The $3.1 billion transaction gives Exxon Mobil access to vast assets in the Montney shale formation in Alberta.</p>

<p>Nike terminated its contract with Lance Armstrong because of the “seemingly insurmountable evidence” that the former cycling champion participated in doping and had “misled” the sportswear company. Nike’s decision comes after a recent damning report from the US Anti-Doping Agency that marked out Mr Armstrong as a “serial cheat” for taking performance-enhancing drugs and for peddling influence with his teammates to do the same.</p>
