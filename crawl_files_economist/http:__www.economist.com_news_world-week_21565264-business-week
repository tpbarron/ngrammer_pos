<p>It was a busy week for tablet-makers. Microsoft started selling its new Surface tablet ahead of the release of Windows 8. Other manufacturers, such as Taiwan’s Asus, introduced snazzier versions of their devices, which will also work on the first new Windows operating system in three years. Not to be outshone, Apple launched the long-awaited mini-iPad, which is two-thirds the size of its bigger brother. Product reviews abounded, with some wondering if, with a starting price of $329, the smaller iPad is too pricey to compete against similar Android tablets and Amazon’s Kindle Fire. See article</p>

<p>Google’s share price struggled to rebound from a drubbing on October 18th, when a weak quarterly-earnings report was released by accident ahead of the close of market.

<p>Rosneft made public the terms of its offer to buy TNK-BP from BP and BP’s Russian partners in the venture. The $55 billion deal is the biggest in the oil industry since Exxon bought Mobil in 1999 and the largest-ever acquisition by a Russian firm. BP walks away with $12.3 billion in cash, a 19.75% stake in Rosneft (which entitles it to two seats on the board), and scope to explore for Russian energy in the Arctic region.</p>

<p>Canada rebuffed a bid by Petronas, Malaysia’s government-owned energy company, for Progress Energy, a Canadian firm. Petronas and Progress immediately started work on thrashing out a new deal, which would provide Petronas with shale-gas assets in the west of Canada. See article</p>

<p>The European Commission shelved a proposal that would have forced companies to ensure that at least 40% of their board members were women by 2020, or face a penalty. The policy provoked a rare fight within the commission. Companies will now be urged to work towards the goal, rather than be forced to meet a quota.</p>

<p>The French government stepped in to help PSA Peugeot Citroën, by providing the carmaker’s financing unit with €7 billion ($9.1 billion) in bond guarantees. In return Peugeot will add a workers’ representative and an independent director to its board and also suspend dividends and bonuses to executives. An aid package had been expected for some time, as Peugeot struggles with weak sales. See article</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ford decided to close its factory in Belgium and shift production to an existing plant in Spain. The company’s car sales in western Europe are at a 20-year low.</p>

<p>Losing a sense of direction</p>

<p>Manganese Bronze, which has been making London’s familiar black taxis since 1948, called in the administrators, after years of losses and a safety recall of its TX4 model left it unable to find financing. The recall was related to a defective steering box. The company, which is based in Coventry and 20% owned by Geely, a Chinese carmaker, saw sales in Britain fall by 9% in 2011 amid increased competition from rival models.</p>
