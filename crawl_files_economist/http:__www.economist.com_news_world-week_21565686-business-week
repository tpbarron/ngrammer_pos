<p>Pick up a Penguin</p>

<p>Penguin and Random House set pulses racing in the publishing world by announcing a joint venture. The combined firm could account for a quarter of book sales in the English language.

Penguin is controlled by Pearson (a part-owner of The Economist) and Random House by Bertelsmann, a German media group. See article</p>

<p>Apple shook up its senior management. Scott Forstall, who oversaw a befuddled roll-out of Apple’s new mapping service (which prompted techie rage in the blogosphere) is leaving the company, as is John Browett, who had been in charge of retail operations for only six months. Apple’s stock, meanwhile, has plunged from more than $700 a share in September to below $600. See article</p>

<p>Netflix’s share price, which has tumbled from its peak in 2011, jumped by 14% after Carl Icahn, a renowned investor, revealed that he has amassed a 10% stake in the video-streaming and DVD-rental company. Mr Icahn expects to see “consolidation in this industry”.</p>

<p>Panasonic took markets by surprise when it reported an $8.7 billion quarterly loss, as it wrote down its business in solar panels, batteries and mobile phones. It had been expected to make a small profit. The struggling Japanese electronics company is headed for another big annual loss of around $10 billion. Sony posted its seventh straight quarterly loss and cut its forecast for the number of cameras, television and games consoles it expects to sell this year.</p>

<p>Fiat’s share price fell sharply after it outlined a turnaround plan, the latest European carmaker to do so to cope with what Fiat calls a “carmageddon” in sales. But instead of closing factories the company will make more top-end Alfa Romeos and Maserati models in Italy and give over more production to exports.</p>

<p>Just as it was hoping to put the LIBOR rate-fixing scandal behind it, Barclays faced fresh investigations into its business in America. Regulators are looking at the bank’s capital-raising efforts during the financial crisis (when it turned to the sovereign-wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Qatar for cash) to make sure they comply with America’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. And a federal energy commission sought to fine Barclays $470m for manipulating energy securities in California four years ago, which it denies.</p>

<p>Moody’s put six of Canada’s biggest banks on review with an eye to downgrading their credit ratings. At the height of the financial crisis Canadian banks were often praised for their prudence and Canada’s financial system was singled out as the strongest in the world by the World Economic Forum. But household debt as a proportion of disposable income has surged, leading to now-familiar warnings about the dangers of debt-fuelled economic growth. See article</p>

<p>U’ve Been Sacked</p>

<p>UBS unveiled more drastic cost-cutting measures, as it shrinks its investment bank to become less capital-intensive and refocus on wealth management. The Swiss bank is shedding 10,000 jobs. Some of the losses were brutally immediate: dozens of traders turned up to work at offices in London this week to find that their security passes were no longer recognised. See article</p>

<p>The former UBS trader whose alleged rogue trades caused a $2.3 billion loss took the stand at his trial. Kweku Adoboli denies the charges, and partly blamed a “huge cultural change” at the Swiss bank that caused executives to push traders to take greater risks. See article</p>

<p>India’s central bank held its main interest rate at 8%, despite being prodded to cut rates by the government, which unveiled a five-year plan to reduce the budget deficit (there was also a big cabinet reshuffle). The Reserve Bank of India did lower the cash-reserve ratio for banks by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.25%, to boost lending. The RBI is trying to tackle India’s twin troubles of a slowing economy and rising inflation.</p>

<p>The new normal?</p>
