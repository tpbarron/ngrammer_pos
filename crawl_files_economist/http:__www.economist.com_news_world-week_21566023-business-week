<p>In a landmark ruling, a judge in Australia found that Standard & Poor’s had misled investors by awarding a triple-A rating to a “grotesquely complicated” derivative product. The risky derivative was dreamed up by ABN AMRO, a Dutch bank that had to be rescued during the financial crisis. The judge ordered S&P and the bank to compensate investors, the first time that a ratings agency has been held liable for losses on a financial product it has assessed as top-notch. S&P plans to appeal.</p>

<p>Merely a precaution</p>

<p>HSBC more than doubled its estimate of the amount it may have to pay to settle penalties arising from a regulatory investigation in the United States into its business in Mexico. The bank is setting aside $1.5 billion to cover fines that could flow from allegations that drug gangs laundered money through HSBC accounts. Some analysts think the figure may reach $2 billion.</p>

<p>BNP Paribas reported a quarterly net profit of €1.3 billion ($1.7 billion), a vast improvement on the same quarter last year, when it wrote down the value of its holdings of Greek debt. The French bank also said it had completed the restructuring of its balance-sheet in order to meet capital requirements under the new Basel 3 rules.</p>

<p>France and Belgium injected another combined €5.5 billion ($7 billion) into Dexia, a stricken bank that is still losing money despite a bail-out in 2008. The decision is likely to be very unpopular with French and Belgian voters, since governments in both countries are pushing to cut spending on social services in order to ease budget deficits.</p>

<p>The European Union slashed its growth forecast for next year. It now expects output in the 17 euro-zone countries to expand by an average of just 0.1%, down from its previous forecast of 1% in May. Germany’s economy is predicted to grow by 0.8%, whereas Spain’s is expected to contract by 1.4% and Italy’s by 0.5%.</p>

<p>Must do better</p>

<p>The EU also forecast that Spain’s budget deficit will reach 6% of GDP in 2013, instead of the 4.5% Spain agreed to four months ago. This puts more pressure on the government in Madrid to introduce further austerity measures.</p>

<p>Fitch upgraded Turkey’s credit rating to BBB- from junk status, the first investment-grade rating from any of the big agencies for the country since it was plunged into an economic crisis in 1994.</p>

<p>American employers added 171,000 jobs to the payrolls in October but the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 7.9%. Barack Obama won re-election with unemployment at its highest on polling day since Franklin Roosevelt’s time, and above the average for presidents since 1948 who have been successfully re-elected.

<p>Australia’s central bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 3.25%. A cut of around 25 basis points is widely expected some time before the end of 2012 because of concerns that the slowdown in commodity prices will hurt growth.</p>

<p>Toyota bucked the recent trend of gloomy annual-earnings forecasts from Japanese carmakers, and raised the amount of profit it expects to make to ¥780 billion ($9.7 billion). Like its rivals in Japan, Toyota has suffered from a sharp drop in sales in China (which were down by 44% for the company in October compared with the same month last year) because of political tensions over some disputed islands. But its business in America has been thriving, mostly driven by demand for its Prius, Camry and Corolla models.</p>

<p>Suzuki decided to stop selling cars in the United States and put its American division into bankruptcy protection. The Japanese carmaker’s small vehicles sell well in India and South-East Asia, but it struggled to compete against bigger American models.</p>

<p>Apple’s share of the global market for tablet computers fell sharply in the third quarter, according to IDC, a research firm. Apple’s iPad accounted for 50.4% of all tablets sold, down from 65.5% in the previous quarter, while Samsung, Amazon and Asus all saw their share of the market jump. But consumers may merely be delaying buying an Apple device; the company said it sold a combined 3m mini iPads and fourth-generation iPads in the three days since they were first available in shops on November 2nd.</p>

<p>The answer, my friend…</p>

<p>Vestas, the world’s biggest manufacturer of wind turbines, announced plans to cut another 3,000 jobs. It will have reduced its workforce by 20% this year, following a previous round of lay-offs in 2010, as cash-strapped European governments curb their subsidies for wind power and competition from China increases.</p>
