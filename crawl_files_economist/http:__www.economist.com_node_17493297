<p>Not long after the euro came into being in January 1999, Germany was derided as the sick man of Europe, its economic fortunes in sharp contrast to the fast-growing countries at the geographical fringes of the new currency zone. More than a decade on, the tables have turned. Even as the “peripheral” economies of Spain, Greece and Ireland continue to struggle, 2011 will be the year in which Germany puts a firm stamp on the euro zone. That will be felt in three related spheres: in Germany's new-found economic strength; in its preference for, and insistence on, greater rectitude in public finances; and in its growing influence on the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>

<p>Europe's economy is set to slow in 2011 as governments address their gaping budget deficits. Germany will enjoy faster GDP growth than the average in the richer parts of the currency zone (whose membership will increase to 17 countries in January when Estonia joins). Germany is less weighed down by household debt and has a smaller budget deficit than almost all its peers—and so has less need to raise taxes or curb public spending. The country is also better placed to benefit from the boom in emerging markets.</p>

<p>Germany's export-oriented companies have penetrated fast-growing Asia and Latin America. China and Brazil are valued clients of big firms that supply kit for power plants and other infrastructure projects. The wares of Germany's small and specialist capital-goods makers will remain in heavy demand. Newly rich consumers in emerging markets will covet German-made luxury cars.</p>

<p>The rest of the euro zone might benefit from a resurgent German economy if it makes the transition from export dependence to growth balanced by more domestic demand. Some progress in this is likely. The revival in German exports has left many firms confident enough to invest and hire. With jobs more plentiful and firms finding that skills are in short supply, wages will rise. Stronger consumer spending should then follow even if Germany's habitual thrift makes a boom unlikely.</p>

<p>But a more balanced German economy will not be enough to rescue some euro-zone countries from a difficult year. Concerted efforts to fix public finances will weigh on GDP growth in most places, including Germany, where—partly as an example to other countries—the government plans to cut its budget by around 0.5% of GDP. Compared with that measure, fiscal policy in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain will be far more restrictive in response to pressures from bond markets.</p>

<p>Those four suffer also from a lack of export competitiveness that is the result of years of wage growth above the euro-zone (and especially the German) average. A weaker euro would help these and other struggling economies price themselves into world markets. But a weaker currency cannot be relied upon if the German influence on the ECB's monetary policy increases.</p>

<p>Frankfurt calling</p>

<p>Such a shift is possible because Jean-Claude Trichet will step down as the ECB's president at the end of October 2011 after a full eight-year term. The front-runners to replace him are two economists who have served on the ECB's rate-setting council as heads of their national central banks. One candidate is Mario Draghi, head of the Bank of Italy, who worked previously as an investment banker, as head of the Italian treasury, and at the World Bank in Washington, DC. The other contender is Axel Weber, a former academic who has been head of Germany's Bundesbank since 2004.</p>

<p>Mr Weber is the likelier of the two to get the top job. The elevation last June of Vítor Constâncio to be the ECB's vice-president has helped his chances. Mr Constâncio, formerly head of Portugal's central bank, is regarded as a “dove”, someone who would be less inclined to squeeze inflation if that risked causing a recession. By contrast, Mr Weber is known as an inflation hardliner who was active in the ECB's decision to raise interest rates in July 2008, just weeks before the economy sank into a deep recession. He would be a counterweight to Mr Constâncio at the top of the ECB in a way that someone else from southern Europe, such as Mr Draghi, might not be.</p>

<p>One of the tasks of the ECB's president is to find a consensus on the ECB's often disparate governing council. So Mr Weber's characteristic bluntness may yet count against him. Mr Draghi would be a better choice because of his broader policy experience and cooler head. But standing in his way is a formidable barrier—the sense that it is Germany's turn for a big euro-job.</p>

<p>If the momentum towards Mr Weber increases, it will have implications for the euro's exchange rate. The currency markets will reckon that, with a hawk at the ECB's helm, monetary policy is likely to be more restrictive (and less unorthodox) than in other places, and they will bid up the euro accordingly. German exporters may not mind having a German central banker in charge: demand for their capital goods and luxury cars tends to be fairly insensitive to prices. But for exporters at the euro zone's periphery, a strong euro will only darken an already gloomy economic outlook.</p>
