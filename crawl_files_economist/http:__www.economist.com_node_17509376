<p>Social networks have already had a profound impact on how we use and share information. By 2036, social networks will also have changed the nature of many of our relationships and how we interact with people.</p>

<p>There is much research showing that well-connected people are more productive, more emotionally satisfied and have higher self-esteem. In the new world, people will maintain 500 social relationships, instead of the average of 125 since the invention of the telephone. This generation will not have to leave old friends or old classmates behind. Why? In less time than it takes to buy, sign and mail a Christmas or birthday card to a single person, you can send news or a gift to your entire social graph. To the digital generation, who don't distinguish between “real” and “virtual”, or “offline” versus “online” friends, this is a life-changer.</p>

<p>Social networks will give people greater access to information wherever they are. Mobile phones could have their own social networks that prompt you with information about all your contacts based on their proximity to you in a room. Think futuristic version of the president's attaché who stands beside him at an event to whisper key details about the person about to shake his hand. You would never be left speechless at a cocktail party again.</p>
