<p>THE proposed merger of Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steelmaker, with Sumitomo Metals, a domestic rival, was announced on February 3rd. The new steel firm would be the world's second- largest, after ArcelorMittal of Luxembourg. It is a welcome sign that Japan Inc is adapting.</p>

<p>Steel provided the backbone of Japan's post-war industrial rise. Its quality—Japanese carmakers swear by it—still makes it a symbol of the country's manufacturing prowess. A move to tie up Japan's number one and number three steelmakers is a sign that the nation's bosses are at last responding to the urgent need for corporate restructuring. It is the country's first steel-industry merger since 2002, and comes as rising raw-material prices and steely competition from other East Asian producers have exposed alarming over-capacity.</p>

<p>The merger, which both companies hope to sign in April 2012, is, to a degree, a family affair. Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metals have roots in rival Osaka industrial groups, but now co-operate and have small cross-shareholdings, so they know each other well.</p>

<p>Together they have a capacity of 47.8m tonnes. That is well short of ArcelorMittal, which produced 73.2m tonnes in 2009. But perhaps putting together two producers of high-quality steel will be better than focusing on quantity alone. And if their example is followed elsewhere in Japan's sclerotic corporate landscape, so much the better for the economy.</p>
