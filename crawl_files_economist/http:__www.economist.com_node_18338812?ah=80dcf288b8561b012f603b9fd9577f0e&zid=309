<p>A NEW round of air wars looms, and more than London's transport links is in the firing line. Boris Johnson, the mayor, has written to the chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, asking him to consider examining “the case for the delivery of a new aviation infrastructure [and] …increased aviation capacity” to serve the capital. Carefully timed before the budget on March 23rd, Mr Johnson's ploy could reopen a long and bitter argument over what sort of airport capacity London needs and where to provide it.</p>

<p>With only two full-length runways and over 66m passengers a year using them, Heathrow airport is at bursting point. It is also hemmed in by homes, making any expansion unpopular. The Labour government's plan for a third runway there was defeated in 2008 after opposition from Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, environmentalists and people living under the proposed flight path.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson's contribution to the debate was to propose a brand new airport on an artificial island in the Thames estuary, purpose-built and capable of operating around the clock. “Boris Island” was dismissed by the Tory leadership as an expensive flight of fancy: too far from London to attract business travellers without costly new transport links.</p>

<p>But the Mayor is not the type to give up easily. At the start of this year, he produced a study calling for either a four-runway hub airport on a new site in the estuary or increased capacity at existing airports nearby, such as Gatwick or Stansted. Mr Johnson is a Tory—but his proposals are explicitly opposed to his party's repeated assurances that no expansion of London's main airports is planned.</p>

<p>The mayor argues that Heathrow is falling behind continental airports. It serves just 185 destinations, compared with over 200 from Paris's Charles de Gaulle and 300 from Frankfurt. A business-friendly capital, he says, needs to make flying in and out more attractive. That means more capacity.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson has a point, but his campaign is one part aviation and one part raw politics. He is thought to harbour leadership ambitions, and if so must have his eye on a fight one day with Mr Osborne, currently his most likely rival. The green Conservatism espoused by David Cameron has no deep roots in the party; Mr Johnson's case for putting business first will resonate with many. Mr Osborne, for his part, is under pressure as chancellor to show that he has a recipe for restoring growth (see Economics Focus). The mayor has been at pains to carve out a distinctive position on London and its interests, pointing out an “aviation-shaped hole” in government plans to boost the capital as an enterprise centre.</p>

<p>City Hall isn't remotely in a position to impose a new Boris Hub on the south-east, but talking about it can create trouble for Mr Johnson's rival on the political runway. No doubt that has occurred to him.</p>
