<p>ROBERT MARK, brought in to clean up corruption in London's Metropolitan Police in 1972, defined a good police force as “one that catches more crooks than it employs”. Forty years later, the stink of corruption once again swirls round the Met. The police and the press, both in the information business, have always had a symbiotic relationship. In the case of News International, Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper outfit, they got too close. A scandal that has licked around the feet of politicians and scorched the press rather more (see Bagehot) has burned Britain's biggest police force badly.</p>

<p>The Met is charged with failing for years fully to investigate phone-hacking at the now-defunct News of the World. Senior officers were too cosy with the tabloid's bosses, the allegation goes, while some junior ones were selling tips to its journalists. An astonishing number of people moved between the Met's payroll and News International's, including the former assistant commissioner who supervised the Met's shoddy inquiry in 2005-06, Andy Hayman, and the deputy editor of the News of the World at that time, Neil Wallis.</p>

<p>This week the Met commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson (pictured right), resigned, taking the fall mainly for agreeing to employ Mr Wallis—a link that emerged after the latter's arrest on July 14th, as part of the force's belated new phone-hacking probe. Assistant Commissioner John Yates (pictured left) resigned too. He had advised against reopening the investigation in 2009 and was involved in getting jobs at the Met for Mr Wallis and his daughter. Both are being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), along with two former officers believed to be Mr Hayman and Peter Clarke, a former deputy assistant commissioner who led the first investigation. Dick Fedorcio, head of public affairs, who hired Mr Wallis (and now employs ten others formerly of News International, a big chunk of his 45-strong staff), has also been referred to the IPCC.</p>

<p>The image is of a police force riddled with conflicts of interest and loyalty, with a small number of officers likely to go to prison for selling tips to journalists and private investigators. Theresa May, the home secretary, does not intend to leave things there. Referring on July 18th to more widespread “alleged corruption and nepotism”, she launched three inquiries into police conduct, raising the total number of external and internal probes to nine. People could be forgiven for thinking the British bobby is wallowing in sleaze.</p>

<p>“That is not only wrong but badly wrong,” says Peter Neyroud, former chief constable of Thames Valley police and head of the National Police Improvement Agency. Though a little corruption is endemic, “a lot of work has been done in the past ten years to raise professional standards,” he says. One who acquitted himself well in the last big crackdown at the Met, in the 1990s, was a young Mr Yates.</p>

<p>Met in the mire</p>

<p>This turn in the scandal matters for at least three reasons. Revelations of incompetence, and perhaps of complicity in wrongdoing, will erode public confidence in the police who, unlike politicians and journalists, continue to command some respect even in this post-deferential age (see chart).</p>

<p>Another concern is that this week's resignations leave the Met short of leadership at a time when London faces a security challenge unlike any for decades. Next summer it will host the Olympic games; Mr Yates, as head of counter-terrorism, was a key figure in preparing for them.</p>

<p>A final piece of fallout is that the affair has undoubtedly weakened the police in the dispute over government plans to reform police governance. Mrs May and others will see the Met's News of the World debacle as another argument for replacing the (often dozy) appointed police authorities who now hold chief constables to account with elected police commissioners, as the government intends to from 2012.</p>

<p>That is not, however, the only possible reading of the travails of the Met, which is already subject to more political control than any of the country's other police forces. A rule change in 2008 permitted Boris Johnson (centre in photo), elected mayor of London that year, to act as chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority. He ran it for 18 months before handing over to his deputy mayor, Kit Malthouse. Mr Malthouse has claimed that he and the mayor have their hands on the tiller of the Met. This newly active political oversight has produced some positive changes, among them a reduction in crime on public buses.</p>

<p>But another result has been instability at the Met. Mr Johnson has just lost his second commissioner in less than three years; in 2008 he forced out Ian (now Lord) Blair. Though the mayor denies that he in effect fired both Sir Paul and Mr Yates, he pulled the commissioner out of a medals ceremony at Hendon Police College to demand an account of Mr Wallis's hiring and fulminated on the radio against Mr Yates's links with the same man. (Although Mr Johnson was told in 2006 that his own phone might have been hacked by the News of the World, in the past he did not use his authority to urge a broader probe; last year he dismissed allegations of widespread hacking as “codswallop”.)</p>

<p>What may emerge from this mess is a new code and a new transparency governing police dealings with the media; the Met has already taken steps in that direction. Another gap that may be filled is for some sort of covenant covering communication between the police and government. Sir Paul felt unable to mention Mr Wallis to the home secretary or 10 Downing Street because David Cameron had his own worries, having employed Mr Wallis's former boss, Andy Coulson, himself. Mr Yates's offer to brief the prime minister on aspects of the hacking investigation was turned down by his chief of staff: as a result the cops were uncomfortable and politicians uninformed. Time to agree some new rules for the road.</p>
