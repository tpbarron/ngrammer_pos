<p>LIKE being the leader of a regicidal tribe or a fractious Caucasian fief, to be chosen as commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police has become an ominous accolade. The two previous incumbents, Sir Ian (now Lord) Blair and Sir Paul Stephenson, were in effect forced out by Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, before their five-year terms were up. This week Mr Johnson and Theresa May, the home secretary, picked Sir Paul's replacement: Bernard Hogan-Howe, a former Merseyside chief constable (right, with Mr Johnson).</p>

<p>Crime fell by a third during Mr Hogan-Howe's stewardship of Merseyside police from 2004 to 2009, more than the overall 17% decline in England and Wales. He is credited with invigorating the force's approach to both guns and gangs, notably in the case of the fatal shooting of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in 2007. Mr Hogan-Howe subsequently served as one of Her Majesty's chief inspectors of constabulary, an elite group of overseers. He is widely respected, if not universally loved, combining brains with a plain-speaking style and, say his fans, an openness to reform. Those qualities are about to be severely tested.</p>

<p>As well as the operational challenges of his new role, Mr Hogan-Howe takes it on knowing that he was by no means everyone's first choice. David Cameron mooted the idea of appointing Bill Bratton, a former police chief in New York and Los Angeles, but dropped it because of opposition from the Home Office. Official advisers reportedly preferred Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, to Mr Hogan-Howe. Mrs May and Mr Johnson disagreed.</p>

<p>The job itself is immense. Next year's Olympic games will be an unprecedented security challenge for the Met. Ordinary crime may rise in the economic doldrums. The force is assimilating the lessons of the recent riots, disorder sparked by officers shooting dead an armed man and encouraged, say some, by the laxity of the Met's initial response. (Some suspect that Sir Hugh's part in a spat between police and the government about who deserved credit for the riots' suppression—only the latest time he has publicly contradicted ministers—helps to explain why he lost out to Mr Hogan-Howe. Insiders strongly deny this.)</p>

<p>As Peter Neyroud, a former senior police officer now at the University of Cambridge, points out, the big, underlying issue is the Met's split accountability and responsibilities. In the home secretary and the mayor, the commissioner serves two masters, who don't always agree. That is the corollary of the force's double workload: its eponymous main function is to police the capital, but it is also the default provider for national tasks such as combating terrorism and investigating political corruption—though some of these may eventually be transferred to the new National Crime Agency.</p>

<p>This week Mr Hogan-Howe vowed to make criminals “fear the police”. But, in the wake of the phone-hacking debacle, his immediate challenge is to make the public respect them. That scandal led to Sir Paul's resignation in July, amid allegations of unhealthy closeness between senior officers and News International executives (Sir Paul himself has been cleared of wrongdoing by the Independent Police Complaints Commission). Some junior officers are said to have taken bribes from reporters. In a daunting brief, Mr Hogan-Howe's simple first rule might be: take care about talking to journalists.</p>
