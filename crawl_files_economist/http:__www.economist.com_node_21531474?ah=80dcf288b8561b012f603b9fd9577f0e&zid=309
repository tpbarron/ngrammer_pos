<p>THE red Routemaster bus is one of London's abiding icons, its curvaceous silhouette as recognisable as Big Ben. The 50-year-old design was pensioned off in 2005, but in January next year a new double-decker with a hop-on, hop-off platform inspired by the Routemaster will appear on the capital's streets. At least, a few of them will.</p>

<p>Other classic vehicle designs, such as the Mini and the Beetle, have been updated for the modern age. Like those new models, the newfangled bus is bigger than the original and combines nostalgia with nifty technology: it uses 40% less fuel than its diesel-guzzling equivalents, and 15% less than recent, hybrid double-deckers. It will be made—mostly—in Britain. In this case, however, the impetus for the reinvention came not from consumer fancy but a fraught political battle.</p>

<p>Ken Livingstone, Labour mayor from 2000 to 2008, championed bus travel, which is now at its highest in London in 50 years: there were 60% more passengers in 2010-11 than in 2000-01. He also introduced 18-metre-long, “bendy” single-deckers. Though these carry more people and are faster to board, they are not universally loved. Contesting the mayoral election in 2008, Boris Johnson, the Conservative candidate (above), swore to cleanse the capital of the blight of bendy buses. He won, and by the end of 2011, all 396 bendy members of the 7,500 fleet will be purged—in time for next year's mayoral election, at which his opponent will be Mr Livingstone.</p>

<p>The revival of something that combined beauty with utility might well prove popular. But popularity can be expensive. As well as retiring healthy buses, Transport for London (TfL), which oversees most of the capital's transit systems, is paying £7.8m to produce just six prototypes (a conventional double-decker costs £315,000). The additional crew member who will staff the open deck might prove an expensive luxury in austere times.</p>

<p>If more orders follow and the modern Routemaster is still ferrying passengers in 40 years' time, the new bus could be a lasting legacy for Mr Johnson. If not, it will be an expensive red elephant.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson is also taking a bet on the libertarianism of voters over a nannying health-and-safety culture. By day, passengers will be able to hurl themselves out of the rear entrance even when the bus is moving (all doors will be closed at night). Daniel Moylan of TfL says it and the mayor's office have “no concerns” about safety; people can be trusted to behave sensibly, he reckons. That really is a political idea that could go places.</p>
