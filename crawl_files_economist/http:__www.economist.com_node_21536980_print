<p>After the cycles of mass protests, sit-ins and killings prompted by the military coup against the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, in 2006, most Thais crave above all a return to some sort of normality, even peace. It's a sentiment that has been picked up and carefully packaged by the country's new prime minister, Mr Thaksin's 44-year-old younger sister, Yingluck. After the years of fierce ideological division between Mr Thaksin's “red shirts” and his opponents' “yellow shirts”, Ms Yingluck promises to govern in 2012 in a spirit of compromise and to use her feminine qualities of “strength and gentleness” to heal the country's wounds.</p>

<p>Fulfilling those promises will be hard, given not just her pedigree as Mr Thaksin's sister but also her faltering reaction to Bangkok's devastating floods in October. Still, some signs are encouraging. Whereas the style of Mr Thaksin, a billionaire businessman, was imperious, ruthless and impatient, Ms Yingluck has set out to be consensual and moderate. </p>

<p>For a start, despite winning by a big margin, she chose to govern as head of a six-party coalition.  And in a move not to antagonise her opponents, Ms Yingluck did not appoint any unruly red shirts to her cabinet. Several harmless technocrats got the nod instead.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ms Yingluck seems to be looking for some sort of grand compromise with the two most powerful institutions in Thai politics, the monarchy and the army, which toppled her brother. Rather than exploit her premiership to exact revenge, she has sensibly decided to let them be, at least for the time being.</p>

<p>Thus the army's budget, which almost doubled after the 2006 coup—in line with the increase in its political sway—will probably be left alone. In return, the army should leave her alone.</p>

<p>It's the same with the monarchy. Ms Yingluck, it seems, will not try to claw back any of the extra power that this revered but deeply conservative institution has accumulated since 2006. On becoming prime minister, Ms Yingluck has bowed lower than anyone in acceptance of the royal prerogative, to counteract suspicions that her ranks are full of closet republicans. Equally, she has shown no interest in repealing, or even reviewing, the country's absurdly harsh and archaic lèse-majesté laws. All this will doubtless disappoint some of her supporters, but it should help to win Thailand a period of stable government.</p>

<p>That would allow Ms Yingluck space and time to implement her many economic pledges. Like her brother, she has positioned herself as an economic populist, promising to help the less well-off with rice subsidies, a minimum wage (of about $10 a day), free tablet computers and much more. Many businesspeople fear that such spendthrift policies will lead to budget deficits and higher inflation. But one thing Ms Yingluck did inherit from the previous government was an economy in robust good health, so she and her respected finance minister, Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, have plenty of room to work with.</p>

<p>However, there are two events that could easily derail Ms Yingluck: the return of her brother and the death of the ailing King Bhumibol (84 as of December 2011). As a fugitive from Thai justice, Mr Thaksin has had to live in exile for the past few years, but if his return to his homeland seems a case of special treatment, or a matter of being let off the charges against him, that will surely provoke a backlash from the yellow shirts and their ilk. The country could be plunged back into confrontational, colour-coded politics.</p>

<p>If the king dies, Ms Yingluck will have to manage the consequences. The heir, the crown prince, is unpopular and could damage the institution. That, too, might lead to more instability. These are two issues of enormous sensitivity, requiring all the strength and gentleness that Ms Yingluck can muster.</p>
