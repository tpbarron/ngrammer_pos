<p>All mayors like to think that the arrival of the Olympic flame in their city is an epoch-shaping event. In Boris Johnson's case, a lot more hangs on the sporting festivities than a feel-good mood, with a bit of infrastructure investment thrown in. These may be Britain's Olympics, but in political terms they're Boris's launchpad. The tousled figure who runs London has ambitions to run the rest of Britain too—and 2012 will decide whether that dream might come true.</p>

<p>When the newspaper columnist associated with the Eurosceptic end of Toryism ran against the Labour old-stager Ken Livingstone in 2008, he was seen as plummy and prone to gaffes. Now he is one of the best-known politicians in the land—widely referred to by his first name and vastly more popular than other top Tories. His Achilles heel could be a string of extra-marital dalliances: 2012 had better be a year of restraint on that score. The Olympics give him an international platform and one from which he can, as a strategist puts it, “move from celebrity to statesman” while projecting his own vision of a post-Cameronian conservatism.</p>

<p>First he has to win his second term as mayor in May—and happily Mr Livingstone is past his electoral sell-by date and does not look like a man with the energy to wrest back the mayoralty he held from 2000 to 2008. </p>

<p>But Mr Johnson's re-election bid takes place at a time when spending cuts will be biting and Britain's coalition government will be in the doldrums of public support. So expect Mr Johnson to hone a position distinct from Cameronism on several counts: a mixture of dry economics and more generous social liberalism.</p>

<p>For one thing, he is pro-migration (he himself has Anglo-Turkish heritage and a New York birthplace) and will speak out strongly against the present immigration cap. As the argument rumbles on about Britain's high top-tax rate—Mr Cameron will keep the 50% rate—Mr Johnson will appeal to the City by railing against it as a defender of London as a global financial centre. On London's riots, he struck a more even tone than the prime minister, condemning the participants but acknowledging that the city's poor need support.</p>

<p>Likeability can go a long way, too. And the Conservative Party likes tall-poppy winners and is all too aware that Mr Cameron did not secure the last election outright. Armed with a mayoral win, successful games and an international profile, Mr Johnson would be well-positioned to re-enter Parliament. That would poise him to run for the leadership, should Mr Cameron lose in 2015. And even if Mr Cameron prevails, his rival will be well-placed to succeed him: many of the prime minister's supporters believe their man will stand down before the end of a second term.</p>

<p>All this, of course, depends on 2012 coming up roses. Boris's nightmare, says an aide, is “Usain Bolt ends up in a traffic jam on the A40.” For a man with his eyes on the prize, that would never do.</p>
