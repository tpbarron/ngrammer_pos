<p>French voters will go to the polls for a presidential election that will defy the script drafted only a year ago. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the one-time poll favourite, will not run. Instead, the Socialists will campaign with a highly inexperienced candidate, François Hollande, for a highly uncertain vote. History has raised the stakes on both sides. On the left, the Socialist Party has not won a presidential election since 1988. On the right, only one former president under the Fifth Republic, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, has failed to win a re-election bid.</p>

<p>The two-round presidential poll, on April 22nd and May 6th, will be followed by parliamentary elections in June; the triumphant party in the first will probably also win the second. Ten or so presidential candidates will stand, including greens and communists. But the outcome will be determined by the performance of just four: Nicolas Sarkozy, the incumbent, on the right; Mr Hollande on the left; François Bayrou in the centre; and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front.</p>

<p>Unloved, Mr Sarkozy cannot hope to charm voters, and so will base his pitch on competence. With a successful armed campaign in Libya to his name, he will present himself as a man of experience, to try to shake off his grating image as a self-promoting, hyperkinetic meddler. His message, however, will be quite different to that of 2007: less about liberalising France, and nudging the French out of their comfort zone, and more about protecting it and asserting a strong state. The upshot will be a more classically Gaullist candidate, not the thrilling reformist politician of yesterday. </p>

<p>This will offer voters less of a clear choice between left and right: socialism will compete with “socialism lite”. The euro-zone crisis will at least force both sides to embrace debt-reduction, a semi-revolution in French politics. But neither will be bold enough to warn of deep spending cuts. Mr Sarkozy has already gone back on a pledge not to raise taxes. Mr Hollande will promise to transfer more of the tax burden to the rich; his party's manifesto pledges to return to retirement at the age of 60.</p>

<p>Sauce Hollandaise</p>

<p>The likeliest second round will pit Mr Hollande against Mr Sarkozy. But a surprise cannot be ruled out. Mr Sarkozy will be squeezed in the centre by Mr Bayrou, who emerges from nowhere to fight each presidential poll, and on the far right by a revived Ms Le Pen. With her steely will and disarming charm, she has detoxified the jack-booted party of her father, Jean-Marie. She will call for France to leave the euro, and will rail against “Islamification” with an appeal to common French values, such as laïcité (secularism). This will push Mr Sarkozy into hard talk on immigration, and keep open the possibility of a first-round shock.</p>

<p>The result will be extremely close. Mr Sarkozy is a formidable campaigner. But there is also a strong desire for change, and a lingering anti-sarkozysme, which Mr Hollande will exploit by branding himself a “normal” president. The second round will turn on a slim majority. On paper, Mr Hollande ought to win. On best form, Mr Sarkozy might just pull off a last-minute victory.</p>

<p>The new president, however, will have his hands tied by the perilous state of the public finances and a faltering economy. Public spending in France as a share of GDP is higher than in Sweden; no government has balanced a budget since 1974. With bond markets fretful, particularly about a Socialist victory, and French banks in trouble, France could even lose its triple-A credit rating. If the Socialists do win, they will not be able to afford many of their promises; retirement at 60 will be junked. If the right is re-elected, Mr Sarkozy will raise taxes under fresh budget pressure. Disappointment will set in fast.</p>

<p>At home, in a year that marks the 50th anniversary of the independence of Algeria, as yet untouched by the Arab spring, there will be a complex sense of malaise in the heavily Muslim banlieues, or suburban council estates. Abroad, France will try to shore up its post-Libya credibility. But there will be quarrels with Germany over how to manage the euro-zone crisis and shape the “economic government” cherished by France. A Socialist victory, coming after the president who returned France to nato's integrated command, would make ties with Britain and America prickly, at least at first; close Franco-British military co-operation could stall.</p>

<p>The year will also mark a new political climate, with voters less tolerant, and the media more inquiring, about their leaders' moral behaviour—both in the boardroom and the bedroom (see article). </p>

<p>France does change, but only slowly. With no leader vowing to alter course radically, the theme in 2012 will be muddling through, rather than a bold, competitiveness-raising reform of the welfare state and labour market that the country still sorely needs. </p>
