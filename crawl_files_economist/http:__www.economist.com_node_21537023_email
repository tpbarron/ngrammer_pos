<p>Germany's barracks are becoming lonelier places. As part of a sweeping overhaul of the Bundeswehr, troop numbers will drop from 222,000 to 170,000, turning an expansive land force designed to hold off the Soviet Red Army into a nimbler outfit better equipped for deployment around the world. Instrumental in achieving this is the suspension of conscription: 2012 will be the first year since the foundation of the Bundeswehr that no young German man will be drafted.</p>

<p>There will not be many mourners. Military service was often seen as a nuisance that delayed entry into the workplace or university. Strategists bemoaned a behemoth in which professionals had to babysit reluctant conscripts and in which deploying draftees out-of-area was legally tricky. Even the draft's fans accept that with money tight it had become untenable.</p>

<p>Bundeswhere?</p>

<p>Going professional—which draws a line under a 200-year-old tradition dating back to the Prussians—is the latest stage in a period of remarkable change which has seen German soldiers deployed around the world, from the Balkans to the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan. Twenty years ago that would have been unthinkable; past German military aggression left bitter memories and fears. Now the call is for Germany to do more, to buttress its economic clout by shouldering more international responsibility rather than, as critics claim, leaving the dirty geo-security work to others (exhibit A: Libya).</p>

<p>Reformers think a more efficient Bundeswehr focused on the sharp end will help do this. Others are not so sure. Some officials and analysts reckon the government still needs to go further and develop a proper national-security strategy that seeks to define Germany's interests and what it will do to pursue—and defend—them. But there is little enthusiasm among policymakers or the public for this. “Strategic ambiguity is more Chancellor Angela Merkel's style,” says Constanze Stelzenmüller of the German Marshall Fund. The public, meanwhile, cares little for the Bundeswehr and even less, polls suggest, for its foreign missions. The armed forces enjoy little of the open displays of respect and support for fighting folk evident in America or Britain.</p>

<p>Germany has become a pacifist country, reflects one retired general: any fears about a revival of militarism are misplaced. Indeed, he doubts whether a cash-strapped army with little popularity and no pool of conscripts to recruit from can attract enough good professionals. Don't be surprised by more foreign gripes about Germany punching below its weight. </p>
