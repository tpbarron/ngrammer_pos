<p>The Italian economy will scarcely be any bigger at the end of 2012 than at the start. Lack of growth is the main reason why Silvio Berlusconi, if he has not already been ousted from power, will go into the new year in a fix. Italians could never be moved to outrage by lurid tales of his sex life. But they object vigorously to being misled about the state of the economy.</p>

<p>In what, even at the time, seemed a fatal miscalcul­ation, Mr Berlusconi and his finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, insisted that Italy had suffered less damage than any other European country in the 2008 credit crunch. It was true that its banks were not rocked in the same way as those in America or Britain. But, heavily dependent on exports, Italy suffered more than most from the downturn in global trade that followed. In 2009 Italy's GDP shrank by 5.2%.</p>

<p>Mr Berlusconi's approval rating began to slide and in September 2011 dipped below 25%. It is hard to see how he can survive in office until 2013, when the next election is due, so 2012 could be the year that Italians go to the polls. But Mr Berlusconi can be removed only by a mutiny in his own party or a change of heart on the part of his coalition allies in the Northern League. If matters came to a head in a crisis, Italy could resort to installing a technocrat (such as Mario Monti, a former European Union commissioner) as prime minister to hold the fort and introduce painful reforms before an election.</p>

<p>Over the ten years from 2002 to 2011, with Mr Berlusconi at the helm for eight of them, growth has been negligible. To expand again, the Italian economy needs structural reform, and Mr Berlusconi and his cronies are either not convinced of the need for it or lack the political will to face down the vested interests—in the trade unions, professional associations and entrenched monopolies—which oppose it.</p>

<p>Low growth is one reason Italy will remain acutely vulnerable to the crisis in the euro zone (the other being its huge public debt, which will exceed 120% of GDP in 2012). The government has drawn up successive austerity budgets to cut the deficit. But they will work only if official growth assumptions are correct, and this is far from assured—not least because the budget tightening has depended more on tax rises than spending cuts.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped, for everyone's sake, that in 2012 Italy does not follow Greece into a lethal downward spiral of higher interest rates on its debt and falling investor confidence. Italy is not too big to fail. But it is almost certainly too big to rescue. </p>
