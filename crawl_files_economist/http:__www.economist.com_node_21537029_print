<p>How can Italy get its act together? Politicians have offered plans, Europe has issued warnings and delivered advice. But planning, warning and advising are not enough. After 18 years of Silvio Berlusconi, only dreaming will do. Here is a cost-free wish-list for 2012.</p>

<p>1 Get a new prime minister. If it's a family man/woman who goes to bed at 11pm, great. If he/she has a lover, make sure there's only one at a time (and that the lover isn't parachuted into parliament).</p>

<p>2 Get a new electoral law. The current one, whereby party leaders can stuff parliament with their lawyers, doctors, clients, relatives and lovers, is a disgrace.</p>

<p>3 Get a new tax system. It's absurd that only 0.17% of taxpayers (76,000 people) declare an income over e200,000  ($272,000) when about 210,000 luxury cars are sold in Italy every year. Make electronic payment the norm. No more my-credit-card-machine-is-on-the-blink routines in shops so they can get cash.</p>

<p>4 Get Italian politicians to stay away from industry and business. Sell off RAI (television), Enel (electricity), Eni (oil), Finmeccanica (defence and aeronautics) and BancoPosta (post-office banking).</p>

<p>5 Scrap the current justice system. Italian citizens—and foreign investors—cannot afford to be stuck in court for seven years waiting for a decision in a civil case. The current, Byzantine rules may keep lawyers happy but they make life impossible for everybody else.</p>

<p>6 Scrap upwards of 100 useless provincial authorities but keep municipalities and regions. That's more than enough.</p>

<p>7 Scrap the Italian Senate, nowadays a useless duplicate of the lower chamber. Transform it into the assembly of the Italian regions (100 members, no more).</p>

<p>8 Introduce a three-term limit. Some Italian parliamentarians have been there for longer than most of the furniture.</p>

<p>9 Introduce a new system to reach markets and audiences outside Italy. Forget ENIT (the national tourism board), drop ICE (trade promotion) and revamp the ICCs (Italian cultural institutes). Give Italian embassies resources to promote Italian interests abroad. Italy makes stuff the world wants (food, fashion, design) but doesn't sell it effectively.</p>

<p>10 Introduce a “Dostoyevsky rule” of crime and punishment into public life. Too many characters are caught but get away with a reprimand, or nothing at all.</p>
