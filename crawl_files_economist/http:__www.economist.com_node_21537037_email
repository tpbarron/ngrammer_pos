<p>“Will 2011 be a year of political change in the Middle East?” The World in 2011 asked in November a year ago, presciently. Unfortunately for this publication, that was the title of a debate at an Economist conference on the year ahead, held in Abu Dhabi. Readers will have searched The World in 2011 in vain for an inkling of the coming Arab spring.</p>

<p>Readers of The World in 2010, by contrast, were given an alert, valid eventually not just for the Arab world but also for places like Madrid, Athens and London, on the likelihood of social unrest. It would be “a year for anger management”, it said. Shame it was the wrong year. In the predictions game, timing matters.</p>

<p>So does the reasoning. Last year's edition did suggest that Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, might step down—but not that he would be pushed. And it said that the then boss of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, would “command headlines”, but it was quite wrong about the reasons.</p>

<p>Some events, of course, are simply unpredictable. In 2011 the unexpected happened in sad ways. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan, with its nuclear aftermath, was one big example. Another was the massacre on Norway's Utøya island.</p>

<p>How did we perform last year in the bread-and-butter of politics, business and the economy? No sooner had The World in 2011 gone to press than one of the events it said might “just possibly” happen actually did: the world's most famous political prisoner, Aung San Suu Kyi, was freed from house arrest. South Sudan gained its independence as forecast. Our correspondents judged the mood of politics in Britain (“a string of foreseeable crises” for the governing coalition) and America (“a year of angry gridlock”) about right.</p>

<p>A number of business predictions—the return of the paywall in media, Linked­In's IPO, a growing interest in emerging markets beyond the BRICs—held up. On the economy, our record was mixed. We captured the overall picture accurately enough: another tough year, with growth in the developing world outpacing that in the rich world by a factor of four. We highlighted the danger of policy mistakes, especially the impact of overzealous austerity.</p>

<p>But we misjudged important details. On America, we managed to be both right and wrong: the below-consensus forecast from the Economist Intelligence Unit (which expected GDP growth of 1.5% in 2011) turned out to be correct, unlike the above-consensus prediction from The Economist's economics writer (whose rose-tinted crystal ball conjured up 3%-plus). On Europe, we underestimated the depth of Greece's recession and how far the euro-zone crisis would spread. In Asia, we thought India's growth rate might just overtake China's; it didn't.</p>

<p>What does all this mean for interpreting the current crop of predictions? Remember they are merely best guesses about the future. And, more than ever, expect the unexpected.</p>
