<p>In the world of technology, it will feel like 1995 all over again. Back then, Netscape, the creator of a web browser, staged an initial public offering (IPO) starting a fashion for flotations and a stockmarket bubble that eventually burst in 2000. In 2012, Facebook will launch its own IPO. The flotation of the giant social network, which pioneered “poking” as a way of saying hello to friends online, will set off another rush to market by fledgling internet firms.</p>

<p>It won't just be Facebook, which now boasts over 800m users, that excites investors. More big Chinese web firms will seek listings in China in 2012. Some of them will follow in the footsteps of outfits such as Youku, a YouTube lookalike, and Renren, a social network, which have listed their shares in America. One company that could seek a flotation in the United States next year is Jingdong Mall, an online retailing behemoth and daily-deals site that is also known as 360buy.com.</p>

<p>Of course, the state of the IPO market will depend heavily on the health of financial markets in general. A bumper global crop of internet IPOs seemed in prospect in 2011, as before the summer mutual funds, private-equity firms and other investors hungry for juicy returns drooled over web companies' prospectuses. But only a few big web firms, including LinkedIn, a social network for professionals, and Pandora, an internet-radio company, managed to go public as turmoil in the world economy scuppered other flotations. A fuss over questionable accounting practices at several Chinese web companies listed on exchanges in America also dented confidence in their shares.</p>

<p>One of the things that has reduced the pressure on tech firms to stage swift IPOs has been the growth of secondary markets in the shares of private companies such as Facebook and Twitter, a microblogging service. These have allowed employees to sell equity stakes to wealthy investors without their employers having to stage a public offering. The snag with such trades is that they can distort the value of firms because buyers often do not have a full picture of a company's finances. Moreover, many tech investors and web entrepreneurs believe they are more likely to get the best price for their equity from public offerings rather than private deals.</p>

<p>There are other reasons why Facebook will go public in 2012. One is that private trading in the firm's equity has expanded the number of its shareholders to a point where in order to comply with American regulations Facebook will have to publish detailed data about its financial performance. Another is that it faces growing competition from the likes of Google, which has launched a rival service called Google+. Facebook will want to seek a listing before rivals erode its lead in the social-networking sphere.</p>

<p>Cash call</p>

<p>Facebook may well want to top the record of Google, which walked away with $1.7 billion when it went public in 2004 in a transaction valuing the search giant at more than $23 billion. As well as giving Facebook mountains of cash to invest, an epoch-making IPO will also have wider repercussions. It will give investors even more appetite for the shares of web companies that produce apps for social networks. It will encourage more start-ups to aim for IPOs (though sales to corporate buyers will remain the most popular way for venture capitalists to get their money back). And it will boost the valuations of other social-networking firms. All this will reignite a debate about whether the mania for social-networking sites is inflating another internet bubble.</p>

<p>Facebook's flotation will also encourage more investment in start-ups. After Google's IPO, some of its employees left the firm with Croesus-like sums of money raised by selling their stakes. A number of these “Xooglers”, as former Google workers are known, have since ploughed back a chunk of their riches into new start-ups. After 2012, wealthy former Facebook staffers—call them “Xbookers”—will have an opportunity to do the same thing. They should make the most of it. </p>
