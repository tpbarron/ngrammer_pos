<p>How the world economy fares in 2012 will depend heavily on business confidence. With governments and consumers bogged down by debt in many countries, business investment will be crucial to any economic recovery. A lot of companies are sitting on piles of cash. Will their bosses risk investing it?</p>

<p>The Economist/FT Global Business Barometer, a quarterly survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit of more than 1,500 senior executives, suggests they enter 2012 in bearish mood. Just 14% of those polled in October expected business conditions to improve in the next six months, down from 23% in July and nearly 40% in May. Overall confidence, measured as the balance of executives who think the global economy will improve against those who expect it to worsen, plunged from a bullish plus 19 percentage points in May to minus 39 by October (see chart). That's worse than on the eve of the financial crisis in September 2008, when a similar survey put confidence at minus 37 points.</p>

<p>Executives in western Europe and Latin America are particularly gloomy: nearly three out of five think things will get worse over the next six months. Of executives in the Middle East and Africa, one in five expects better times ahead, compared with only one in ten in Europe.</p>

<p>What is driving this gloom? Economic and market risk is the biggest worry for executives, troubling three out of every four. They have become less concerned about inflation, but increasingly fretful about currency volatility: it now alarms 25% of executives. Similarly a quarter of businesspeople are worried about skills shortages; in Asia a third of them are concerned about it.</p>

<p>Executives in the chemicals industry, property, financial services and manufacturing are especially pessimistic; those in defence and telecoms a little more cheery. (For views from the sanitation ­industry, see "The future's rubbish".)</p>

<p>Not so long ago it might have been hard to find many executives who thought the euro zone would fracture. That one in five executives now believes it will is a measure of how much things have changed. The good news for the euro, though, is that this means that four out of five respondents think the single-currency zone will stick together.</p>
