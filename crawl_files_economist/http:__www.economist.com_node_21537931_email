<p>Hollywood has long had a fascination with the little guy who battles to expose illegal or unethical behaviour by big corporations, from the nuclear industry (“The China Syndrome”, “Silkwood”) to pharmaceuticals (“The Constant Gardener”) and tobacco (“The Insider”). More recent releases include “The Whistleblower”, in which Rachel Weisz outs human trafficking by a United Nations contractor, and “Chasing Madoff”, a documentary on Harry Markopolos's efforts to alert the world to Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>In the real world, the whistleblower's plight is decidedly un-Hollywood-like. Exposing wrongdoing at powerful companies is hugely stressful. Employers denounce those who do as snitches or cranks. It is easy to descend into paranoia or self-doubt. Mr Markopolos still beats himself up wondering what he might have done differently to expose Mr Madoff sooner.</p>

<p>Life will get a bit easier, and a lot more lucrative, for fraud-busters in 2012. Countries around the world will further strengthen protections for whistleblowers. And the monetary incentives to come forward will grow.</p>

<p>Thank the global financial crisis. Governments, in a fiscal pickle after bailing out their banks, will devote more effort to stamping out the types of fraud that pillage the public purse (in Medicare, say, or military procurement). Financial regulators, having failed abysmally to root out wrongdoing before 2008, will increasingly look to outsource policing to corporate sleuths and insiders who are closer to the action. Tips are by far the leading source of fraud detection (see chart).</p>

<p>This will be most apparent in America. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed after the crisis, offers whistleblowers strong protections from retaliation and bounties of up to 30% of awards resulting from their tip-offs. The measures, which went into effect in August, “could be a game-changer because they turn everyone into a potential whistleblower,” says Gary Aguirre, who exposed the soft treatment by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Wall Street bigwigs in an insider-trading case. All the SEC, which will administer the programme, has to do is “be patient enough to listen,” he adds.</p>

<p>The new incentives should encourage more of those who uncover wrongdoing to step forward, greatly reducing the number who tell nobody for fear of reprisals from their employer (30-40%, according to one study). They will receive help from a fast-growing cottage industry of whistleblower lawyers, advocacy groups, such as America's National Whistleblowers Centre (NWC), and document-publishers. Anticipating a bonanza, tort lawyers have begun to switch from other practice areas.</p>

<p>Celebrated whistleblowers, too, will become stronger pillars of the supporting infrastructure. Since the Madoff affair, Mr Markopolos has coaxed disaffected insiders into bringing allegations of price-gouging against banks that trade foreign exchange. He wants to make a career of “digging up skeletons, one at a time”. Mr Aguirre, a lawyer, has nurtured, among others, an SEC insider who wanted to publicise the agency's shredding of documents relating to closed investigations.</p>

<p>All of which suggests that 2012 will be a bumper year for fraud detectives. Payouts are not new, to be sure: some $3 billion has been distributed to whistleblowers since 1987 under America's False Claims Act, which covers government contractors. But expect the number of bounties in the tens or even hundreds of millions to jump. Financial services will be fertile territory, given the temptation for stressed firms to cook the books.</p>

<p>Some corporate executives squeal that the new rules will produce waves of frivolous claims by gold-diggers. But the evidence so far suggests that the quality of tips has gone up, not down. Deep down, bosses know there is no going back. The costs of overhauling internal-compliance procedures will grow sharply in 2012, as many discover how inadequate existing systems are. Big companies will begin to offer what Gregory Keating of Littler Mendelson, an employment-law firm, calls “mini Dodd-Franks”: extra bounties for employees who report their concerns internally before approaching regulators.</p>

<p>What worries chief executives most is the global reach of America's new rules. Dodd-Frank mandates payments for whistleblowers whose tips lead to penalties under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This applies to companies based anywhere, so long as their securities are traded in America, even if the corruption took place overseas and the whistleblower is a foreign national.</p>

<p>This marks a “powerful turning-point in trans­national whistleblowing”, says Stephen Kohn of the NWC. “For the first time, whistleblowers from countries with weak democratic institutions can come to America to get due process.” Such cases are likely to proliferate in 2012. As a result, multinationals will grow warier of operating in countries where they have to pay to play. Meanwhile, whistleblowers will continue to face harassment in countries that insist on viewing them as a national embarrassment. And, everywhere, bounty hunters will still need a thick skin and plenty of patience.</p>
