<p>The mobile-phone market is rapidly becoming saturated: forecasters expect 94 mobile-phone subscriptions for every 100 people in 2012. In rich countries, consumers often own more than one phone; in emerging markets, penetration is rising fast. Saturation means mobile revenue growth will slow to 5% in 2012, half the pace in 2011.</p>

<p>Feature-rich, internet-enabled smartphones will account for 40% of all mobile shipments, according to IHS iSuppli, a research firm. This will fuel sales of mobile applications, generating $16bn of revenue in 2012, says PwC. Half of new smartphones will use Google's Android operating system, more than twice the share of its nearest competitor, Apple's iOS, according to Gartner. </p>

<p>The rollout of so-called “4G” services will gather pace, although the financial gain for operators will not match the hype. The step-up in speed and features from 4G is not the same as that from earlier generations to 3G, so pushing premium prices to customers will be difficult.</p>

<p>To watch: Screen inflation. After years of shrinking, mobile phones are growing again. Some new smartphones have displays of up to 5.5 inches diagonal (14cm), blurring the boundary between phone and tablet. Although great for browsing the web and watching videos, users making calls on these supersized smartphones may look as awkward as cellular's pioneers. </p>
