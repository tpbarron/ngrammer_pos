<p>Although travellers may cut trips short, wanderlust will prove immune to patchy economic conditions. Globally, overnight tourist arrivals will rise by around 5% in 2012, up from 3% the year before, according to the European Travel Commission. Spending growth by businesspeople will outpace holidaymakers, as travellers worry more about personal finances than their expense accounts.</p>

<p>After soaring fuel costs savaged airlines' profits in 2011, fragile demand in 2012—especially among leisure travellers—will limit earnings growth. The industry as a whole will remain profitable, just, thanks to the higher fares from a limited expansion in routes. From January, airlines operating in the EU will be charged for their carbon emissions, adding about $1.5bn in costs for the year, according to Point Carbon, a consultancy.</p>

<p>Like airlines, hoteliers in developed markets will rely on limited expansion to sustain profits. Thanks mostly to price rises, revenue per room at US hotels will grow by 6%, according to PwC. Despite a boost from the London Olympics, UK hotels will struggle to achieve similar growth. China will remain the world's busiest builder of hotels, opening twice as many new rooms as second-ranked America, according to a research firm, Lodging Econometrics. </p>

<p>To watch: Jet set. Thanks to social media, seats on private jets will soon be within reach of ordinary travellers. If enough people express interest in a particular route, start-up sites like Social Flights in the US and Victor in Europe will charter a jet for the group. As these schemes grow, fares could rival coach-class commercial flights.  </p>
