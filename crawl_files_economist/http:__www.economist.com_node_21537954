<p>Tiny Macau, number one among the world's top-growing economies for 2012, proves that casino gambling is a more sustainable driver of growth than the purely financial variety. Prominent, too, are Libya and Iraq, two Arab countries in which reconstruction and stabilisation after the violent overthrow of authoritarian regimes will unleash growth. In Libya's case, the surge is a bounce-back from an even more precipitous slump while war raged. War's ravages are more distant for Iraq, but post-conflict chaos delayed the recovery, and performance in 2012 may mark the start of something more sustained. Also prominent is China; this is fortunate, since the demand generated by the world's second-largest economy will counteract some of the drag from the troubled rich world. Mongolia is enjoying a mining boom, and investment in the sector will boost growth. Angola, Laos and Niger will all benefit from relatively high commodity prices, and Ethiopia and Rwanda are gaining from the gradual commercialisation of their rural economies.Â </p>
