<p>The centre-right government of Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria lacks an outright majority, and, having fallen out with the nationalist Attack party, relies on independents in parliament for a majority, making it vulnerable to defection. Nevertheless, it is likely to see out its term, helped by a modest rally in the economy. The government will continue the hard slog against official corruption, not least because the disbursement of European funds to this, the EU's poorest country, depends on it. Protests have been a perennial problem, and the need for a squeeze on public spending to tame the deficit will ensure more trouble in 2012.</p>
