<p>It's an election year, and thanks to Dominique Strauss-Kahn's extended stay in New York, the opposition Socialist Party needed a new standard-bearer. It now has one in François Hollande, who won the party primary in late 2011. A centrist, Mr Hollande will pose a stiff challenge to Nicolas Sarkozy, the increasingly unpopular president. The resurgent right-wing National Front under Marine Le Pen will also have a say, perhaps forcing the two leading parties into a blocking front if she makes it to the second round. Amid all of this, the economy will flatline as French leaders go on trying to save the euro. </p>
