<p>Germany wants to preserve the euro, but Germans don't want to bail out feckless southern Europeans. In 2012, either the voters or the euro will prevail. Either path spells trouble for Chancellor Angela Merkel and her coalition government, and this is likely to be their last year in office ahead of elections in 2013. Assuming the euro survives (the alternative is too awful to contemplate), the country will still have to contend with austerity among major trade partners, and the economy will stagnate.</p>

<p>To watch: Heaven on Earth. Genesis, a theme park based on the Bible, is planned for an undetermined site in Germany. Attractions will include a Tower of Babel, a “heaven and hell” rollercoaster, and a life-sized Noah's ark.</p>
