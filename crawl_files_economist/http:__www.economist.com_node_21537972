<p>Readers of Bild, Germany's bestselling newspaper, might be forgiven for thinking that a matinée idol will soon take the country's top corporate job. “The cricket player with George Clooney charm” is how it describes Anshu Jain, the Indian financier who will become co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank in 2012. Mr Jain is not much less foreign to the bank's culture than Mr Clooney himself. He will be the bank's first non-German-speaking chief executive. His background in risky investment banking, a world away from Deutsche's staid domestic business, also makes him controversial.</p>

<p>A wave of new young leaders will make their mark on European business in 2012. They are pushing aside the old guard on the continent, sometimes roughly. The trend is most pronounced in Germany. As well as Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Telekom, Henkel (a consumer-goods group), SAP (a business-software giant), Bayer (pharmaceuticals and chemicals) and E.ON (a utility) all have new chief executives in their 40s or early 50s.</p>

<p>Germany Inc's new leadership will be far more international than before. Of the eight new bosses at the six companies mentioned above (SAP, like Deutsche Bank, has appointed co-chiefs), only three are German. Appointing foreigners has not always been easy. Peter Terium, a 48-year-old Dutchman, will take over in 2012 at RWE Group, Germany's biggest power producer, after facing an internal row over the succession; his rival candidate was older and German.</p>

<p>In Italy business leaders under 70 are considered mere striplings. But there are some signs of change. In 2011 Alberto Nagel, the 46-year-old chief executive of Mediobanca, an investment bank at the heart of corporate Italy, led the ouster from Generali, an insurance company, of its 76-year-old chairman, Cesare Geronzi. Mr Geronzi was later sentenced to four years in prison for his role in a bankruptcy. Mr Nagel has improved transparency and governance at Mediobanca and has imposed an age limit for top managers of 65.</p>

<p>In Spain an important handover came in 2011, when Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex, a fashion and logistics group which is one of the country's most innovative firms, handed the chairmanship to Pablo Isla, its 47-year-old chief executive. France's most disruptive young businessman is Xavier Niel, a 44-year-old entrepreneur who is the country's first internet billionaire. In 2012 he will start a long-awaited battle against the country's three dominant telecoms firms. Iliad, his company, will start selling mobile telephony for around half the price charged by the incumbents.</p>

<p>The coming year will also shine a spotlight on the young heirs to Europe's business dynasties. Arnaud Lagardère, the son of the founder of Lagardère, a French media-to-weapons group, plans to take over the chairmanship of eads, Europe's defence and aerospace champion, in 2012. Some at the company, however, reckon he is not serious enough for the job. He scandalised French business when he released an online video of himself smooching with a new girlfriend. Antoine Arnault, son of Bernard Arnault, a French financier and luxury mogul, will launch the first ready-to-wear collection for Berluti, a maker of men's luxury shoes. Success in the new job (he was formerly at Louis Vuitton, a handbag-and-luggage maker) could pave his way to the top of LVMH, a luxury group.</p>

<p>Businesswomen will be in great demand in 2012. Viviane Reding, the EU's justice commissioner, has threatened to introduce compulsory quotas for female board members if European firms don't bring in more women by March. But the real question is whether they will move beyond tokenism and promote women to run things, not just sit on the board. One female executive to watch is Pascale Sourisse, who runs the defence-and-security-systems unit at Thales, a French aerospace and ­defence group. She nearly became one of Europe's most prominent businesswomen in 2011 when France's government considered her as a replacement for Anne Lauvergeon as boss of Areva, a nuclear-energy champion (in the end it chose a man).</p>

<p>Several of Germany's family-controlled firms are promoting daughters who have grown up in the business. Henkel recently became the first of Germany's big blue-chip firms to have a female head of the supervisory board. Simone Bagel-Trah is a great-great-granddaughter of Henkel's founder. Young, often foreign and occasionally female: these will be the new bosses to watch in Europe in 2012. </p>
