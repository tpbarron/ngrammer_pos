<p>Need a car in Paris? In 2012 you will be able to rent an electric one from a car-sharing scheme called Autolib. Although a “green” business, its logo is blue (just to confuse things, its “Bluecars” in Paris are silver). It is yet another example of blue becoming the new green.</p>

<p>Carmakers are using blue as a colour and a word to express cleanness and efficiency—even for vehicles with petrol and diesel engines. Volkswagen puts a “BlueMotion” badge on its most efficient cars; Mercedes-Benz adds a “Blueefficiency” emblem to its environmentally friendly (and easiest to recycle) models. New Holland, part of Italy's Fiat group, uses the name “ecoBlue” on its low-emissions range of blue tractors.</p>

<p>Other sorts of firms that have nothing to do with cars are doing the same. Samsung called a solar-powered phone “Blue Earth”. Blue-branding extends from organic bodycare to natural-ingredient dog food.</p>

<p>“Green is so obvious,” says Jack Bredenfoerder, for 19 years the colour expert at Landor, a firm of brand consultants, who now runs Cincinnati-based bv Color Strategy. “Blue has got a bit more seriousness to it,” he adds. Blue is a global colour—a perception in part from its association with the sea. It is also a colour of co-operation: the United Nations, Facebook and Twitter use blue.</p>

<p>Will it last? Colour trends come and go. Mr Bredenfoerder expects white will start to compete with blue because it is a clean and efficient colour. White has been popularised by Apple and will bite into the long dominance of silver as the most popular car colour. It is, thanks to the clouds, the other colour you see when looking from space at the blue planet.</p>
