<p>The Fine Gael-Labour Party government faces no threat from a fragmented opposition, swept out of power in the devastation of the 2008-09 financial collapse, and will concentrate on administering the bitter medicine imposed by Europe and the IMF in return for an â‚¬85bn ($115bn) rescue. This includes a hard fiscal squeeze, wage restraint and political reform. When the country returns to voluntary credit markets in late 2012 or early 2013, the rates on offer are likely to be prohibitive and a new rescue may be needed. The economy will not grow at all.</p>
