<p>The centre-left coalition government may not survive until elections late in the year, after a horrible 2011 in which it lost both its parliamentary majority and a referendum on flagship reforms. It will soldier on with fiscal tightening, with record spending cuts in the works. Real structural reform will be on hold until a new government—probably from the centre-right—takes over after the election. The target for the budget gap, 3% of GDP, should be reached in 2013, but growth in 2012 will be weak.</p>

<p>To watch: Club card. An EU minnow, Slovenia may nevertheless exercise its veto powers to block Croatia's accession, pencilled in for 2013. A border agreement with Croatia left many Slovenes dissatisfied, and a new government might use the accession timetable as a chip in reopened negotiations.</p>
