<p>GDP growth: 1.0% GDP: $575bn (PPP: $399bn) Inflation: 1.3% Population: 9.6m GDP per head: $60,130 (PPP: $41,710)</p>

<p>The economy is growing and the budget is heading into surplus, but the four--party centre-right coalition is facing a succession of defeats in parliament and will find it hard to implement its agenda (and perhaps even to see out its full term). Reforms to encourage job-seeking and to divest state assets can proceed only where opposition can be bypassed, so progress will be incremental. Sweden's economy, like most in Europe, will be weak, though it will expand more than most of the others.</p>

<p>To watch: Not right. The one thing all leading parties share is their distaste for the far-right Sweden Democrats, who have been garnering support since entering parliament in 2010. For this reason alone, the ruling coalition will probably be allowed to complete its term.</p>
