<p>As the newly installed president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, an Italian with a strong pedigree in public and private banking, becomes custodian of a euro in crisis and with at least one euro-zone member, Greece, on the verge of default. His appointment in late 2011 to succeed a Frenchman, Jean-Claude Trichet, nearly didn't happen. At the 11th hour France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, threatened to block the deal unless another Italian on the ECB board agreed to make way for a Frenchman, since the departure of Mr Trichet left France unrepresented. This is not just petty politics; Greek default would threaten some big French banks. If he is to succeed, Mr Draghi will have to balance many such political interests while walking a financial tightrope.Â </p>
