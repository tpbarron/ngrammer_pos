<p>For an Oxford-educated ex-seminarian, Tony Abbott, leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party, has a way with words. He has achieved notoriety for the free expression of his views on issues from illegal immigration (“stop the boats”) to meeting homosexuals (“I'd probably feel a bit threatened”) to an emissions-trading levy (“a great big new tax on everything”).
