<p>The Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) ran the country for 71 years before voters ejected it in 2000. In July, tired of economic uncertainty and unchecked drugs violence, the voters will probably bring the PRI back (See 2012 in person: Enrique Peña Nieto). Lawmaking will stagnate until after the vote, and thereafter the outgoing Partido Acción Nacional may block the reforms it drafted in government. A much-needed revamp of the country's labour laws, energy market and administrative system will have to wait another year. Mexico, meanwhile, will deepen its co-operation with the US in fighting drugs crime on both sides of the border, with more US intelligence agents and police officials operating inside Mexico, though quietly and with little fanfare.</p>
