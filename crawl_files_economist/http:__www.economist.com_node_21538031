<p>Married to a popular soap star, Enrique Peña Nieto, the former governor of the State of Mexico and presidential candidate for the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), has the smouldering good looks of a romantic hero. There was a time when such things mattered little; elections were a formality and the PRI candidate, anointed by dedazo (“tap of the finger”), was guaranteed victory. That era came to an end in 2000, when Vicente Fox, an imposing moustachioed businessman, exploited popular fatigue with PRI hegemony to snatch power for his Partido Acción Nacional (PAN). If Mr Peña Nieto is now poised to snatch it back, growing discontent with falling living standards and rising drugs violence under the PAN will play their part, but boyish good looks won't hurt. </p>
