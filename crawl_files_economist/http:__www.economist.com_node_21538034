<p>Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's president, never figured to have an easy time replacing her popular predecessor, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. Plagued by corruption scandals and infighting in her administration, she has looked wobbly much of the time. Her focus on social programmes, including poverty reduction, won't go over well in a country accustomed of late to rapid growth and strong income gains. With the global economy slowing, and Brazil's with it, Ms Rousseff's inexperience will leave her vulnerable to attack.</p>
