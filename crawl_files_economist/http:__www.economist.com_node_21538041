<p>President Jos√© Mujica's centrist reforms do not appeal to left-wingers in his Frente Amplio coalition, and his main challenge is to maintain discipline on the government benches while meeting pledges on civil-service reform, education and infrastructure. He will need the occasional support of the right-wing opposition, making the challenge all the tougher. He will prevail, but at a cost to the pace of reform. After expansions of 8.5% and 6.3% in 2010 and 2011 respectively, economic growth will moderate to a more sustainable pace.</p>
