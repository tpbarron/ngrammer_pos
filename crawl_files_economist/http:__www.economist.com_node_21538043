<p>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria's crusading finance minister from 2003 to 2006, is back in her old job after a stint as a managing director of the World Bank. The daughter of a tribal king from Nigeria's turbulent Delta region, she studied at Harvard and MIT, and worked at the World Bank as an economist for more than 20 years before coming home the first time to run the finance ministry. She helped stabilise Nigeria's finances and pushed through anti-graft reforms in a country regarded as one of the world's most corrupt. After her second turn at the World Bank, she is back, answering the call of the new president, Goodluck Jonathan. As the administration seeks a more businesslike approach to government, her presence will reassure companies and investors eyeing the country's enormous potential.Â </p>
