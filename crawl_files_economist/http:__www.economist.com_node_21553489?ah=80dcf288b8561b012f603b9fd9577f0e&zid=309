<p>SINCE the budget provoked a din of disapproval last month, Downing Street has been looking forward to May 3rd. The losses likely to be sustained in elections across 180 local authorities would be modest for a mid-term government, they calculated. And those losses would be sidelined by the re-election of the Conservative Boris Johnson (pictured, with Labour's Ken Livingstone) as mayor of London.</p>

<p>The government now dreads polling day. It is no longer afflicted by minor embarrassments over the taxation of hot snacks and charitable donations, but by grave questions over the future of Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, and its own economic credibility following Britain's re-entry into recession. The Tories' plummeting national poll ratings—the party trails Labour by a double-digit margin in some surveys—is dragging down Mr Johnson. Polls tend to show him modestly ahead of Mr Livingstone, but they have become erratic. Defeat for the incumbent would heighten the impression of a government under siege.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Tories are likely to be mauled in local elections. The last time the 5,000 council seats being contested were up for election was 2008, when the party was at its most popular. It captured more than 250 seats. It could now lose over 400. This would not only deepen the current Tory crisis but weaken its longer-term ability to win parliamentary seats in these areas. Parties need a strong base in local government to put up a good fight in general elections. The Tories' loss of MPs in large parts of northern England over the past two decades was preceded by the shrinking of the party's presence there.</p>

<p>Their coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, are also expecting a painful night. They stand to lose around 300 councillors and control of authorities such as Cheltenham and Portsmouth. Some in the party worry that they will score less in the popular vote than the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic outfit which has pulled ahead of the Lib Dems in some opinion polls. Tories, too, fret that UKIP's rise could split the right-of-centre vote at the general election in 2015.</p>

<p>For its part, Labour is cannily playing down expectations of spectacular gains of up to 700 seats. But the party is on course to do well, especially in northern territories such as Rochdale and Liverpool. Its recent surge in the polls might be enough to keep the Scottish nationalists at bay in Glasgow (see article). Whether Labour will prosper in the south outside London, where it lacks both councillors and MPs, is less clear.</p>

<p>Although the London race looks increasingly propitious for Labour, it may not be such a bad thing for the party if Mr Johnson hangs on. Mr Livingstone is a contentious figure: he has drawn criticism for his tax affairs and comments he has made about the Jewish community, bankers and Tories. He has put the national Labour Party in an awkward position during the campaign—some of its notables, such as the celebrity peer Lord Sugar, are not voting for him—and might continue to do so in office. When he ran London between 2000 and 2008, Labour could define itself by what it was doing in national government. It no longer has that luxury in opposition.</p>

<p>But the ultimate political import of May 3rd lies elsewhere. As part of the government's vision of a more localised state, Liverpool and Salford will also be electing mayors, while ten other cities decide whether to have them. The immediate impact will be limited: many of the mayoral candidates are members of the existing political classes, such as the former MP Sion Simon and the serving one, Gisela Stuart, rather than maverick outsiders.</p>

<p>Over time, however, politics could be transformed. Cities such as Birmingham, Bristol and Leeds—if they choose to have mayors—could develop their own political ecosystems, with local media becoming more interesting to residents. Westminster would remain the heart of the British polity, but a slightly less dominant one. Indeed, some MPs from these cities are privately anxious that mayors will denude them of power and prestige.</p>

<p>There is also a strategic opportunity for the Tories in this new wave of localism. The party has only managed to go so far in re-branding itself as broad and inclusive under Mr Cameron's leadership. There is a view that the job of “modernisation” can only be completed by showing rather than telling. If Conservatives become city mayors and police commissioners (the government's other big localist innovation) and perform well in these offices, it will do more to revive the party's reputation in the north than any public-relations campaign. May 3rd is likely to be ugly for the Tories. But it might come to be seen as the day the party began to end its exile from the great northern cities.</p>
