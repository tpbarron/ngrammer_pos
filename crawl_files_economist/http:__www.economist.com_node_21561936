<p>MANUEL VICENTE, now seen as the heir apparent to Angola’s long-serving president, José Eduardo dos Santos, has had almost no formal political experience. He has never been elected to any position. He got his first government job, as minister of economic development, only eight months ago. But he has been an effective head of Angola’s oil giant, Sonangol, the chief purveyor of party funds, for the past 12 years.</p>

<p>During that time he has turned a relatively small state oil company into Africa’s energy giant, with an annual turnover of $34 billion, equal to more than two-thirds of the entire public budget. He has also been privy to many of a corrupt regime’s most closely guarded secrets. As a friend of the president, he is likely to keep things that way—perhaps another reason why he was chosen.</p>

<p>An electronic engineer by training, Mr Vicente, who speaks excellent English, knows the ways of the world. He has built ties with China, Angola’s main trading partner and biggest investor. Reserved, discreet and courteous, like his presidential boss, he is respected in the global corridors of business, although Sonangol has a mixed reputation as a state within a state and has been criticised for its secretiveness.</p>

<p>Opinion is divided over when or whether Mr dos Santos, will choose to go. The new constitution imposes a two-term presidential limit. But that rule does not take effect until after the election, so Mr dos Santos could serve for another ten years. Mr Vicente, aged 56, may have quite a wait.</p>
