<p>FOR the second time, an Italian court has ruled against the former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, in a case in which he is suing The Economist for libel. He had sued the newspaper in 2001, claiming it had libelled him in a report headlined “An Italian story”, published in April of that year.</p>

<p>Seven years later, a judge rejected all of Mr Berlusconi’s claims and ordered him to make a payment for costs to The Economist. Mr Berlusconi, who was by then again Italy’s prime minister, appealed. We are pleased to report that the court in Milan has turned down his appeal. The judges again ordered the former prime minister to pay The Economist’s costs. Mr Berlusconi can now take his case to Italy’s highest appeals court. But he would have to do so on a point of law or procedure.</p>

<p>A separate case involving Mr Berlusconi and The Economist ended two years ago. He had claimed he was libelled in an open letter from our then-editor, Bill Emmott. The letter challenged him to answer questions about his business and political dealings that were set out in detail in an online dossier. That case was thrown out by a judge in 2009, but without any award for costs. Mr Berlusconi did not appeal and in 2010 the judgment became definitive.</p>

<p>During the years when Mr Berlusconi dominated Italian politics, its economy grew more slowly than anywhere else in the world, apart from Zimbabwe and Libya. Perhaps he should have paid more attention to that.</p>
