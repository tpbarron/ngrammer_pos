<p>AMERICA and Europe, when they work together, still have huge clout. So how far people on each side of the Atlantic agree is a subject that repays scrutiny. The latest Transatlantic Trends, an annual survey published by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think-tank, polled 12 European Union states, plus Russia, Turkey and the United States. One striking finding is that capitalism’s reputation is severely dented. In Europe 76% of respondents felt that their economic system benefited mostly a few; 64% of Americans agreed. The French fear China; the Dutch see great commercial chances there.</p>

<p>Barack Obama would win re-election easily if Europeans could vote, though he does less well in the continent’s ex-communist east. In Poland, once staunchly Atlanticist, support for American leadership has plunged by 11 points since 2011. Sweden stands out in Europe as the country most positive about foreign intervention (see chart). Russia, surveyed for the first time, is an ultra-sceptic outlier on that. Views of Russia in America and Europe have soured, though Russian views of the European Union are still strongly positive.</p>
