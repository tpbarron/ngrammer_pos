<p>The pace of hiring has slowed in 26 of the 42 countries tracked by Manpower, an employment-services firm.

In Italy and Spain more employers still plan to cut the size of their workforce than expand it. Uncertainty—about the euro crisis, China’s slowdown and America’s presidential election—is hurting hiring intentions. But the prospect of more jobs in wholesale and retail trade is helping America maintain its pace of hiring. In Mexico City the employment outlook is stronger than at any time since 2002.</p>
