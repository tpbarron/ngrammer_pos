<p>ON SEPTEMBER 22nd the beer started flowing at the annual Oktoberfest in Munich. Last year, over the course of the 16-day event, visitors glugged 7.5m litres. For a half-litre (a trifle by Bavarian standards) an average German needs to work only seven minutes, according to analysts at UBS, a Swiss bank. For Czechs (who swig even more than Germans) the figure is similar. Only Americans need work less for their ale.</p>

<p>Indians, by contrast, must toil for nearly an hour before they have earned enough to quench their thirst (the world average is 20 minutes). But India will be the fastest-growing market by volume in coming years. Growing adult populations and rising living standards mean that beer consumption in emerging markets is booming. Drinkers there drank two-thirds of the worldâ€™s beer in 2011. By 2016, it will be 72%.</p>
