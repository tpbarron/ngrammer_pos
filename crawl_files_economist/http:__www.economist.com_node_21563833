<p>In an article on DNA tests for illegal logs ("Seeing the wood for the trees", September 22nd) we mis-spelled Jonathan Geachâ€™s name. He is the executive director of DoubleHelix, not the CEO. We also said that it costs $450 to test $45,000-worth of merbau wood. The correct figure is $250. And we suggested that genetic mapping is required for all timber DNA testing services. In fact it is necessary only for some.</p>

<p>In a recent article on American beer and spirits ("Prohibition hangover", September 8th), we wrote that craft distillers accounted for just over 25% of the spirits sold and 45% of the revenue from spirits last year in America. In fact that is the market share not for craft distilleries, but for high-end and super-premium spirits. We apologise for these errors.</p>
