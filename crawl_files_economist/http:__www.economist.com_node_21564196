<p>FANS of charter cities—the idea of planting internationally run exclaves in poor countries—are downcast. The leading intellectual backer of their most promising venture has pulled out amid a row about transparency. On September 4th Michael Strong, an American activist and entrepreneur, signed a preliminary deal for a small project in Honduras. That outmanoeuvred Paul Romer, an economics professor at New York University, who had backed a bigger one.</p>

<p>Mr Romer’s plan featured a transparency commission: a quasi-judicial check on the city’s administrators. Charter cities aim to replicate the success of places like colonial-era Hong Kong, offering a business-friendly regime but without direct democratic oversight.</p>

<p>The Honduras government agreed in December to set up the transparency commission; it included George Akerlof, an economist, and Ong Boon Hwee, a former senior executive at Singapore Power. But it has yet to publish a decree to give the body legal clout. Mr Romer deplores what he calls “an overt act of deception”. In the meantime Mr Strong has struck his own deal, for a “less far-fetched” project that aims to create jobs and cheap housing.</p>

<p>Mr Romer’s enthusiasm is undimmed. He says it will take several tries before a project succeeds. But the sort of places that most need charter cities may also be where founding them is trickiest.</p>
