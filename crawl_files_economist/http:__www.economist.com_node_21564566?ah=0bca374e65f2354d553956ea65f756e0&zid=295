<p>GOLD is the most difficult asset class to analyse. For a start, it divides opinion so sharply. Its supporters have a quasi-religious fervour, regarding the metal as the one true source of value. Its detractors (a group that includes many economists) treat it, in John Maynard Keynes’s phrase, as a “barbarous relic” that has no place in serious discussions of monetary policy.</p>

<p>The task of valuing gold is made harder by the fact that it lacks a yield, let alone a profit from which you can calculate a price-earnings ratio. The best you can do is see how its price has performed relative to other things (see chart). Since 1971, when its link to the dollar was severed, gold has easily outpaced American consumer and house prices; it has beaten the S&P 500 and oil as well. The picture is not quite as clear if you compare the price with the 1980 peak; gold is still lower now in real terms than it was then.</p>

<p>One way of explaining gold’s rise is as an alternative currency. The Swiss franc has been so strong of late that the Swiss central bank has intervened to cap its value; even so, gold has easily outperformed the franc over the past 40 years. On this view, gold’s surging value is related to investors’ nervousness about paper money. Although the total supply of gold grows very slowly, central banks can create new money with just the click of a mouse. David Bloom of HSBC reckons that central banks have created $9 trillion of money during the crisis, equivalent to the value of all the gold that has ever been mined.</p>

<p>While rich-country central banks are busy creating money, developing-world central banks are buying gold—a record 158 tonnes in the second quarter, according to the World Gold Council. Daniel Brebner of Deutsche Bank sees a version of Gresham’s law at work here, in which the good money (gold) is hoarded in central-bank reserves and in exchange-traded funds, and the bad money (the dollar) is used for transactions. Expansionary monetary policy is thus good for gold.</p>

<p>But if paper money is being debased, the evidence has yet to show up in consumer prices. Nor has there has been any sign of the kind of rise in inflationary expectations—either in consumer surveys or in bond-market movements—that would justify the doubling of the gold price since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p>

<p>Inflation is low in the developed world because the economy is weak. It is hard for businesses to raise prices or for workers to demand higher wages. But it is also worth remembering that central banks are not the only source of money creation: commercial banks are normally much more important. To the extent that they are shrinking their balance-sheets, they are reducing the money supply as fast as the central banks are expanding it. In Britain, for example, despite continued quantitative easing, the broad measure of money supply fell by 4.1% in the year to August.</p>

<p>Another explanation for the strength of gold revolves around real (ie, after inflation) interest rates. In normal times the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, instead of interest-bearing bank deposits or government bonds, is high. Real rates are now negative in developed countries, so the opportunity cost of holding gold has disappeared. Indeed, Goldman Sachs reckons that current real rates are compatible with a gold price of more than $2,000 an ounce.</p>

<p>Gold is some way off that mark, however. It currently hovers just under $1,800 an ounce, below a high of $1,921 reached last year (although it recently hit a high in euro terms). This does not seem to be down to a lack of investor enthusiasm. BullionVault, which allows retail investors to buy and sell physical gold online, has seen a preponderance of buyers over sellers every month since early 2010. According to ETF Securities, an investment manager, third-quarter inflows into gold-related exchange-traded funds were $7.7 billion, the highest level since the second quarter of 2010.</p>

<p>But as with any commodity (see article), high prices are creating a market response. Mining firms are expected to produce almost 2,900 tonnes of gold this year, up from 2,400 tonnes in 2008. Many people (particularly Indians) are cashing in by recycling their jewellery; the scrap market grew from 600 tonnes in 2000 to 1,660 tonnes last year.</p>

<p>That response has checked the rally. But it is hard to see the gold price collapsing unless real interest rates increase sharply. With the Federal Reserve set to hold rates at current levels until 2015, that means a good chance of a high gold price for some years to come.</p>
