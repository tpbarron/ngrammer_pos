<p>About 280 billion non-cash payments were made in 2010 (the latest year for which final data are available), 7% more than in 2009. The rich world accounts for 80% of these. But the latest “World Payments Report” estimates that robust growth in emerging markets could have pushed the number of transactions above 300 billion in 2011. Brazil is now the second-largest market behind America. Cards account for 56% of non-cash payments; more than one in three payments are made with a debit card (increasingly chosen over cash for small amounts). As the use of cheques falls, electronic and mobile payments could grow annually by 20% and 53% respectively between 2009 and 2013.</p>
