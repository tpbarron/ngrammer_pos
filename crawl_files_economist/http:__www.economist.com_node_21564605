<p>AS THEY swish past in their flashy cars on their way to parliament, members of Kenya’s legislature are often greeted nowadays by protesters shouting “Mwizi !”, Swahili for “thief”. Having lost the power to vote for a rise in their basic salary, thanks to a new constitution endorsed in a referendum two years ago, the lawmakers found a sneaky way to boost their pay. It has not been popular.</p>

<p>A last-minute amendment to a recent finance bill saw them seek to increase their own severance packages from just over 1.5m Kenyan shillings ($18,000) to the equivalent of $118,000. It so happens that all of Kenya’s 222 MPs will be in line for this golden handshake, since parliamentary constituencies have been redrawn since the last election, which means that all of them will technically lose their seats before running for new ones in March. But in an unusual step, Kenya’s president, Mwai Kibaki, felt obliged to step in, declaring the bill “unconstitutional” and “untenable”. So in the end the MPs’ trick may not work.</p>

<p>By any measure, MPs in Kenya, which has east Africa’s biggest economy, already enjoy a fat remuneration. Their all-in annual pay of $120,000, including perks, puts them among the best-paid legislators in the world. Two years ago they tried to up their yearly whack to over $150,000, but had to hold back after public protests. Still, an MP’s daily take-home pay of $325 is not bad compared with the $1.25 or less on which 43% of the population has to live, according to the World Bank. In Nairobi, the capital, a day labourer earns less than $2. The ratio of the prime minister’s pay, reckoned to be $300,000-plus, to the country’s GDP per person, is at least 200:1.</p>

<p>Samuel Kimeu of Transparency International, a Berlin-based anti-corruption monitor, accused Kenya’s MPs of “disregarding all rules of decency”. An independent body, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission, which is meant to act as a check on Kenya’s pecuniary imbalances, says it may go to court to block the MPs’ ruse. Graffiti have started to appear on Nairobi’s streets depicting MPs as vultures and hyenas.</p>
