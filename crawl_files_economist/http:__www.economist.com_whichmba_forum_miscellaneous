<p>I am Software Professional having 3 years of experience residing in Bangalore,India. I have been wanting to pursue MBA but have limited exposure to the various streams and options in MBA.</p>

<p>This is driving me a little bonkers. I want to transition into a career in public policy/nonprofit work, which means I'll need a better background in government & policy, law, and policy analysis.</p>

<p>One problem never noted: What if you have an MBA (I do), and work for people who do not?</p>

<p>I am a young professional considering going back for an MBA and am just starting to look at all the available financing options. Any tips are welcome.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to hear thoughts, perspectives and experiences about online MBA programs. Specifically, is there a great deal of bias today against online MBA programs?</p>

<p>What are some of the less-obvious pros and cons of spending a semester abroad?</p>
