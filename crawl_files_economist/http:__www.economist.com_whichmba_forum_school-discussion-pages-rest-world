<p>China has continued to change over the last few decades, and its economy has grown at a rapid, breakneck speed. China is now the second largest economy in the world, and the business environment is certainly one of the most dynamic. Chinese businesses are fast becoming global giants, such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Huawei. Foreign companies are also entering the market with unprecedented commitments in investments.</p>

<p>Not only is the domestic business environment growing fast, but China's reach into the greater world economy is expanding as well. It is more important than ever for people to understand China and its business culture. Today, if businesses all around the world do not have access to China, they are behind the times.</p>
